<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<blockquote><p>Who ought to go then and who ought to stay!<br />
Where do you draw an obvious border line?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Cecil and Mary</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the numerous steeples counted from the waters of the
Thames, in the heart of the City, and grudged by modern economy
as cumberers of the soil of Mammon, may be remarked an abortive
little dingy cupola, surmounting two large round eyes which have
evidently stared over the adjacent roofs ever since the Fire that
began at Pie-corner and ended in Pudding-lane.</p>
<p>Strange that the like should have been esteemed the highest
walk of architecture, and yet Honora Charlecote well remembered
the days when St. Wulstan&rsquo;s was her boast, so large, so
clean, so light, so Grecian, so far surpassing damp old
Hiltonbury Church.&nbsp; That was at an age when her enthusiasm
found indiscriminate food in whatever had a hold upon her
affections, the nearer her heart being of course the more
admirable in itself, and it would be difficult to say which she
loved the most ardently, her city home in Woolstone-lane, or
Hiltonbury Holt, the old family seat, where her father was a
welcome guest whenever his constitution required relaxation from
the severe toils of a London rector.</p>
<p>Woolstone-lane was a locality that sorely tried the coachmen
of Mrs. Charlecote&rsquo;s West End connections, situate as it
was on the very banks of the Thames, and containing little save
offices and warehouses, in the midst of which stood
Honora&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; It was not the rectory, but had been
inherited from City relations, and it antedated the Fire, so that
it was one of the most perfect remnants of the glories of the
merchant princes of ancient London.&nbsp; It had a court to
itself, shut in by high walls, and paved with round-headed
stones, with gangways of flags in mercy to the feet; the front
was faced with hewn squares after the <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>pattern of
Somerset House, with the like ponderous sashes, and on a smaller
scale, the Louis XIV. pediment, apparently designed for the
nesting-place of swallows and sparrows.&nbsp; Within was a hall,
panelled with fragrant softly-tinted cedar wood, festooned with
exquisite garlands of fruit and flowers, carved by Gibbons
himself, with all his peculiarities of rounded form and delicate
edge.&nbsp; The staircase and floor were of white stone, tinted
on sunny days with reflections from the windows&rsquo; three
medallions of yellow and white glass, where Solomon, in golden
mantle and crowned turban, commanded the division of a stout
lusty child hanging by one leg; superintended the erection of a
Temple worthy of Haarlem; or graciously welcomed a recoiling
stumpy Vrow of a Queen of Sheba, with golden hair all down her
back.</p>
<p>The river aspect of the house had come to perfection at the
Elizabethan period, and was sculptured in every available nook
with the chevron and three arrows of the Fletchers&rsquo;
Company, and a merchant&rsquo;s mark, like a figure of four with
a curly tail.&nbsp; Here were the oriel windows of the best
rooms, looking out on a grassplat, small enough in country eyes,
but most extensive for the situation, with straight gravelled
walks, and low lilac and laburnum trees, that came into profuse
blossom long before their country cousins, but which, like the
crocuses and snowdrops of the flower borders, had better be
looked at than touched by such as dreaded sooty fingers.&nbsp;
These shrubs veiled the garden from the great river thoroughfare,
to which it sloped down, still showing traces of the handsome
stone steps and balustrade that once had formed the access of the
gold-chained alderman to his sumptuous barge.</p>
<p>Along those paths paced, book in hand, a tall, well-grown
maiden, of good straight features, and clear, pale skin, with
eyes and rich luxuriant hair of the same colour, a peculiarly
bright shade of auburn, such as painters of old had loved, and
Owen Sandbrook called golden, while Humfrey Charlecote would
declare he was always glad to see Honor&rsquo;s carrots.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, personal teaching at a London
parish school or personal visiting of the poor was less common
than at present, but Honora had been bred up to be helpful, and
she had newly come in from a diligent afternoon of looking at the
needlework, and hearing Crossman&rsquo;s Catechism and
Sellon&rsquo;s Abridgment from a demurely dressed race of little
girls in tall white caps, bibs and tuckers, and very stout
indigo-blue frocks.&nbsp; She had been working hard at the
endeavour to make the little Cockneys, who had never seen a
single ear of wheat, enter into Joseph&rsquo;s dreams, and was
rather weary of their town sharpness coupled with their
indifference and want of imagination, where any nature, save
human nature, was concerned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will bring an ear of
Hiltonbury wheat home with me&mdash;some of the best girls shall
see me sow it, and I will take them to watch it growing
up&mdash;the blade, the ear, the full corn in the ear&mdash;poor
dears, if they only had a Hiltonbury to give them some tastes
that <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>are not all for this hot, busy, eager world!&nbsp; If I
could only see one with her lap full of bluebells; but though in
this land of Cockaigne of ours, one does not actually pick up
gold and silver, I am afraid they are our flowers, and the only
ones we esteem worth the picking; and like old Mr. Sandbrook, we
neither understand nor esteem those whose aims are
otherwise!&nbsp; Oh! Owen, Owen, may you only not be withheld
from your glorious career!&nbsp; May you show this hard,
money-getting world that you do really, as well as only in word,
esteem one soul to be reclaimed above all the wealth that can be
laid at your feet!&nbsp; The nephew and heir of the great Firm
voluntarily surrendering consideration, ease, riches, unbounded
luxury for the sake of the heathen&mdash;choosing a wigwam
instead of a West End palace; parched maize rather than the
banquet; the backwoods instead of the luxurious park; the Red
Indian rather than the club and the theatre; to be a despised
minister rather than a magnate of this great city; nay, or to
take his place among the influential men of the land.&nbsp; What
has this worn, weary old civilization to offer like the joy of
sitting beneath one of the glorious aspiring pines of America,
gazing out on the blue waters of her limpid inland seas, in her
fresh pure air, with the simple children of the forest round him,
their princely forms in attitudes of attention, their dark soft
liquid eyes fixed upon him, as he tells them &ldquo;Your Great
Spirit, Him whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto
you,&rdquo; and then, some glorious old chief bows his stately
head, and throws aside his marks of superstition.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe,&rdquo; he says, and the hearts of all bend with him; and
Owen leads them to the lake, and baptizes them, and it is another
St. Sacrament!&nbsp; Oh! that is what it is to have nobleness
enough truly to overcome the world, truly to turn one&rsquo;s
back upon pleasures and honours&mdash;what are they to such as
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So mused Honora Charlecote, and then ran indoors, with
bounding step, to her Schiller, and her hero-worship of Max
Piccolomini, to write notes for her mother, and practise for her
father the song that was to refresh him for the evening.</p>
<p>Nothing remarkable!&nbsp; No; there was nothing remarkable in
Honor, she was neither more nor less than an average woman of the
higher type.&nbsp; Refinement and gentleness, a strong
appreciation of excellence, and a love of duty, had all been
brought out by an admirable education, and by a home devoted to
unselfish exertion, varied by intellectual pleasures.&nbsp; Other
influences&mdash;decidedly traceable in her musings&mdash;had
shaped her principles and enthusiasms on those of an ardent
Oxonian of the early years of William IV.; and so bred up, so led
by circumstances, Honora, with her abilities, high cultivation,
and tolerable sense, was a fair specimen of what any young lady
might be, appearing perhaps somewhat in advance of her
contemporaries, but rather from her training than from intrinsic
force of character.&nbsp; The qualities of womanhood well
developed, were so entirely the staple of her composition, that
there is <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>little to describe in her.&nbsp; Was
not she one made to learn; to lean; to admire; to support; to
enhance every joy; to soften every sorrow of the object of her
devotion?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Another picture from Honora Charlecote&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It
is about half after six, on a bright autumnal morning; and,
rising nearly due east, out of a dark pine-crowned hill, the sun
casts his slanting beams over an undulating country, clothed in
gray mist of tints differing with the distance, the farther hills
confounded with the sky, the nearer dimly traced in purple, and
the valleys between indicated by the whiter, woollier vapours
that rise from their streams, a goodly land of fertile field and
rich wood, cradled on the bosoms of those soft hills.</p>
<p>Nestled among the woods, clothing its hollows on almost every
side, rises a low hill, with a species of table land on the top,
scattered over with large thorns and scraggy oaks that cast their
shadows over the pale buff bents of the short soft grass of the
gravelly soil.&nbsp; Looking southward is a low, irregular,
old-fashioned house, with two tall gable ends like eyebrows, and
the lesser gable of a porch between them, all covered with large
chequers of black timber, filled up with cream-coloured
cement.&nbsp; A straight path leads from the porch between beds
of scarlet geraniums, their luxuriant horse-shoe leaves weighed
down with wet, and china asters, a drop in every quilling, to an
old-fashioned sun-dial, and beside that dial stands Honora
Charlecote, gazing joyously out on the bright morning, and trying
for the hundredth time to make the shadow of that green old
finger point to the same figure as the hand of her watch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! down, down, there&rsquo;s a good dog, Fly;
you&rsquo;ll knock me down!&nbsp; Vixen, poor little doggie,
pray!&nbsp; Look at your paws,&rsquo; as a blue greyhound and
rough black terrier came springing joyously upon her, brushing
away the silver dew from the shaven lawn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down, down, lie down, dogs!&rsquo; and with an
obstreperous bound, Fly flew to the new-comer, a young man in the
robust strength of eight-and-twenty, of stalwart frame, very
broad in the chest and shoulders, careless, homely, though
perfectly gentleman-like bearing, and hale, hearty, sunburnt
face.&nbsp; It was such a look and such an arm as would win the
most timid to his side in certainty of tenderness and protection,
and the fond voice gave the same sense of power and of kindness,
as he called out, &lsquo;Holloa, Honor, there you are!&nbsp; Not
given up the old fashion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not till you give me up, Humfrey,&rsquo; she said, as
she eagerly laid her neatly gloved fingers in the grasp of the
great, broad, horny palm, &lsquo;or at least till you take your
gun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you are not grown wiser?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor ever will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every woman ought to learn to saddle a horse and fire
off a gun.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&lsquo;Yes, against the civil war squires are always
expecting.&nbsp; You shall teach me when the time
comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never see that time, nor any other, if you
go out in those thin boots.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fetch Sarah&rsquo;s
clogs; I suppose you have not a reasonable pair in the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My boots are quite thick, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brown paper!&rsquo;&nbsp; And indeed they were a
contrast to his mighty nailed soles, and long, untanned buskins,
nor did they greatly resemble the heavy, country-made galoshes
which, with an elder brother&rsquo;s authority, he forced her to
put on, observing that nothing so completely evinced the Londoner
as her obstinacy in never having a pair of shoes that could keep
anything out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where are you going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Hayward&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; Is that too far for
you?&nbsp; He wants an abatement of his rent for some
improvements, and I want to judge what they may be
worth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hayward&rsquo;s&mdash;oh, not a bit too far!&rsquo; and
holding up her skirts, she picked her way as daintily as her
weighty <i>chaussure</i> would permit, along the narrow green
footway that crossed the expanse of dewy turf in which the dogs
careered, getting their noses covered with flakes of thick
gossamer, cemented together by dew.&nbsp; Fly scraped it off with
a delicate forepaw, Vixen rolled over, and doubly entangled it in
her rugged coat.&nbsp; Humfrey Charlecote strode on before his
companion with his hands in his pockets, and beginning to
whistle, but pausing to observe, over his shoulder, &lsquo;A
sweet day for getting up the roots!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not
getting wet, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t through this rhinoceros hide, thank
you.&nbsp; How exquisitely the mist is curling up, and showing
the church-spire in the valley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I suppose you have been reading all manner of
books?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the best was a great history of
France.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;France!&rsquo; he repeated in a contemptuous John Bull
tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, don&rsquo;t be disdainful; France was the centre of
chivalry in the old time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better have been the centre of honesty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so it was in the time of St. Louis and his
crusade.&nbsp; Do you know it, Humfrey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was full permission.&nbsp; Ever since Honora had been
able to combine a narration, Humfrey had been the recipient,
though she seldom knew whether he attended, and from her babyhood
upwards had been quite contented with trotting in the wake of his
long strides, pouring out her ardent fancies, now and then
getting an answer, but more often going on like a little singing
bird, through the midst of his avocations, and quite complacent
under his interruptions of calls to his dogs, directions to his
labourers, and warnings to her to mind her feet and not her
chatter.&nbsp; In the full stream of crusaders, he led her down
one of the multitude of by-paths cleared out in the hazel coppice
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>for sporting; here leading up a rising ground whence the
tops of the trees might be overlooked, some flecked with gold,
some blushing into crimson, and beyond them the needle point of
the village spire, the vane flashing back the sun; there bending
into a ravine, marshy at the bottom, and nourishing the lady
fern, then again crossing glades, where the rabbits darted across
the path, and the battle of Damietta was broken into by stern
orders to Fly to come to heel, and the eating of the nuts which
Humfrey pulled down from the branches, and held up to his cousin
with superior good nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Mameluke rushed in with a scimitar streaming with
blood, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care; do you want help over this fence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I, thank you&mdash;And said he had just murdered
the king&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vic! ah! take your nose out of that.&nbsp; Here was a
crop, Nora.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you don&rsquo;t know wheat
stubble?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember it was to be wheat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Red wheat, the finest we ever had in this land; not a
bit beaten down, and the colour perfectly beautiful before
harvest; it used to put me in mind of your hair.&nbsp; A load to
the acre; a fair specimen of the effect of drainage.&nbsp; Do you
remember what a swamp it was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember the beautiful loose-strifes that used to
grow in that corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! we have made an end of that trumpery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You savage old Humfrey&mdash;beauties that they
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What had they to do with my cornfields?&nbsp; A place
for everything and everything in its place&mdash;French kings and
all.&nbsp; What was this one doing wool-gathering in
Egypt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, it had become the point for
the blow at the Saracen power.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; Oh, the
Mameluke justified the murder, and wanted St. Louis to be king,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! a fine covey, I only miss two out of them.&nbsp;
These carrots, how their leaves are turned&mdash;that ought not
to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora could not believe that anything ought not to be that
was as beautiful as the varied rosy tints of the hectic beauty of
the exquisitely shaped and delicately pinked foliage of the field
carrots, and with her cousin&rsquo;s assistance she soon had a
large bouquet where no two leaves were alike, their hues ranging
from the deepest purple or crimson to the palest yellow, or clear
scarlet, like seaweed, through every intermediate variety of
purple edged with green, green picked out with red or yellow, or
<i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, in never-ending brilliancy, such as
Humfrey almost seemed to appreciate, as he said, &lsquo;Well, you
have something as pretty as your weeds, eh, Honor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t quite give up mourning for my dear long
purples.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All very well by the river, but there&rsquo;s no beauty
in things <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>out of place, like your Louis in
Egypt&mdash;well, what was the end of this
predicament?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Humfrey had really heard and been interested!&nbsp; With
such encouragement, Honora proceeded swimmingly, and had nearly
arrived at her hero&rsquo;s ransom, through nearly a mile of
field paths, only occasionally interrupted by grunts from her
auditor at farming not like his own, when crossing a narrow
foot-bridge across a clear stream, they stood before a farmhouse,
timbered and chimneyed much like the Holt, but with new sashes
displacing the old lattice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Humfrey, how could you bring me to see such
havoc?&nbsp; I never suspected you would allow it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was without asking leave; an attention to his bride;
and now they want an abatement for improvements!&nbsp;
Whew!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should fine him for the damage he has
done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be hard on him, he is more or less of an
ass, and a good sort of fellow, very good to his labourers; he
drove Jem Hurd to the infirmary himself when he broke his
arm.&nbsp; No, he is not a man to be hard upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t be hard on any one.&nbsp; Now that
window really irritates my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Sarah walked down to call on the bride, and came
home full of admiration at the place being so lightsome and
cheerful.&nbsp; Which of you two ladies am I to
believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to make it a duty to improve the general
taste!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you build a model farm-house, and
let me make the design?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, when I want one that nobody can live in.&nbsp;
Come, it will be breakfast time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are not you going to have an interview?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I only wanted to take a survey of the alterations;
two windows, smart door, iron fence, pulled down old barn, talks
of another.&nbsp; Hm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he will get his reduction?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he builds the barn.&nbsp; I shall try to see his
wife; she has not been brought up to farming, and whether they
get on or not, all depends on the way she may take it up.&nbsp;
What are you looking at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That lovely wreath of Traveller&rsquo;s Joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you want it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you, it is too beautiful where it
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a piece, going from tree to tree, by the
Hiltonbury Gate, as thick as my arm; I just saved it when West
was going to cut it down with the copsewood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you really are improving at last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you would never let me hear the last of it;
besides, there was a thrush&rsquo;s nest in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By and by the cousins arrived at a field where Humfrey&rsquo;s
portly shorthorns were coming forth after their milking, under
the pilotage of an old white-headed man, bent nearly double, <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>uncovering his head as the squire touched his hat in
response, and shouted, &lsquo;Good morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir,&rsquo; said the old man, trying to
erect himself, &lsquo;I wanted to speak to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir, chimney smokes so as a body can
scarce bide in the house, and the blacks come down
terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wants sweeping,&rsquo; roared Humfrey, into his deaf
ears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have swep it, sir; old woman&rsquo;s been up with her
broom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old woman hasn&rsquo;t been high enough.&nbsp; Send
Jack up outside with a rope and a bunch o&rsquo; furze, and let
her stand at bottom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir!&rsquo; cried the old man, with a
triumphant snap of the fingers over his shoulder.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Miss Honor, John;&rsquo; and Honora came
forward, her gravity somewhat shaken by the domestic offices of
the old woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you still able to bring out the
cows, John.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my favourite Daisy as tame as
ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! ay!&rsquo; and he looked at his master for
explanation from the stronger and more familiar voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I be deaf, you see, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Honor is glad to see Daisy as tame as ever,&rsquo;
shouted Humfrey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! ay!&rsquo; maundered on the old man; &lsquo;she
ain&rsquo;t done no good of late, and Mr. West and I&mdash;us
wanted to have fatted her this winter, but the squire, he
wouldn&rsquo;t hear on it, because Miss Honor was such a terrible
one for her.&nbsp; Says I, when I hears &rsquo;em say so, we
shall have another dinner on the la-an, and the last was when the
old squire was married, thirty-five years ago come
Michaelmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora was much disposed to laugh at this freak of the old
man&rsquo;s fancy, but to her surprise Humfrey coloured up, and
looked so much out of countenance that a question darted through
her mind whether he could have any such step in contemplation,
and she began to review the young ladies of the neighbourhood,
and to decide on each in turn that it would be intolerable to see
her as Humfrey&rsquo;s wife; more at home at the Holt than
herself.&nbsp; She had ample time for contemplation, for he had
become very silent, and once or twice the presumptuous idea
crossed her that he might be actually about to make her some
confidence, but when he at length spoke, very near the house, it
was only to say, &lsquo;Honor, I wanted to ask you if you think
your father would wish me to ask young Sandbrook here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! thank you, I am sure he would be glad.&nbsp; You
know poor Owen has nowhere to go, since his uncle has behaved so
shamefully.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must have been a great
mortification&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Owen?&nbsp; Of course it was, to be so cast off for
his noble purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking of old Mr. Sandbrook&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old wretch!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no patience with
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&lsquo;Just as he has brought this nephew up and hopes to
make him useful and rest some of his cares upon him in his old
age, to find him flying off upon this fresh course, and
disappointing all his hopes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is such a high and grand course, he ought to
have rejoiced in it, and Owen is not his son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man of his age, brought up as he has been, can hardly
be expected to enter into Owen&rsquo;s views.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not.&nbsp; It is all sordid and mean, he
cannot even understand the missionary spirit of resigning
all.&nbsp; As Owen says, half the Scripture must be hyperbole to
him, and so he is beginning Owen&rsquo;s persecution
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was one of Humfrey&rsquo;s provoking qualities that no
amount of eloquence would ever draw a word of condemnation from
him; he would praise readily enough, but censure was very rare
with him, and extenuation was always his first impulse, so the
more Honora railed at Mr. Sandbrook&rsquo;s interference with his
nephew&rsquo;s plans, the less satisfaction she received from
him.&nbsp; She seemed to think that in order to admire Owen as he
deserved, his uncle must be proportionably reviled, and though
Humfrey did not imply a word save in commendation of the young
missionary&rsquo;s devotion, she went indoors feeling almost
injured at his not understanding it; but Honora&rsquo;s petulance
was a very bright, sunny piquancy, and she only appeared the more
glowing and animated for it when she presented herself at the
breakfast-table, with a preposterous country appetite.</p>
<p>Afterwards she filled a vase very tastefully with her
varieties of leaves, and enjoyed taking in her cousin Sarah, who
admired the leaves greatly while she thought they came from Mrs.
Mervyn&rsquo;s hothouse; but when she found they were the product
of her own furrows, voted them coarse, ugly, withered things,
such as only the simplicity of a Londoner could bring into
civilized society.&nbsp; So Honora stood over her gorgeous
feathery bouquet, not knowing whether to laugh or to be scornful,
till Humfrey, taking up the vase, inquired, &lsquo;May I have it
for my study?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! yes, and welcome,&rsquo; said Honora, laughing, and
shaking her glowing tresses at him; &lsquo;I am thankful to any
one who stands up for carrots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Good-natured Humfrey, thought she, it is all that I may not be
mortified; but after all it is not those very good-natured people
who best appreciate lofty actions.&nbsp; He is inviting Owen
Sandbrook more because he thinks it would please papa, and
because he compassionates him in his solitary lodgings, than
because he feels the force of his glorious self-sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The northern slope of the Holt was clothed with fir
plantations, intersected with narrow paths, which gave admission
to the depths of their lonely woodland palace, supported on
rudely straight columns, dark save for the snowy exuding gum,
roofed <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>in by aspiring beam-like arms,
bearing aloft their long tufts of dark blue green foliage,
floored by the smooth, slippery, russet needle leaves as they
fell, and perfumed by the peculiar fresh smell of
turpentine.&nbsp; It was a still and lonely place, the very
sounds making the silence more audible (if such an expression may
be used), the wind whispering like the rippling waves of the sea
in the tops of the pines, here and there the cry of a bird, or
far, far away, the tinkle of the sheep-bell, or the tone of the
church clock; and of movement there was almost as little, only
the huge horse ants soberly wending along their highway to their
tall hillock thatched with pine leaves, or the squirrel in the
ruddy, russet livery of the scene, racing from tree to tree, or
sitting up with his feathery tail erect to extract with his
delicate paws the seed from the base of the fir-cone scale.&nbsp;
Squirrels there lived to a good old age, till their plumy tails
had turned white, for the squire&rsquo;s one fault in the eyes of
keepers and gardeners was that he was soft-hearted towards
&lsquo;the varmint.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Canadian forest on a small scale, an extremely miniature
scale indeed, but still Canadian forests are of pine, and the
Holt plantation was fir, and firs were pines, and it was a lonely
musing place, and so on one of the stillest, clearest days of
&lsquo;St. Luke&rsquo;s little summer,&rsquo; the last afternoon
of her visit at the Holt, there stood Honora, leaning against a
tree stem, deep, very deep in a vision of the primeval woodlands
of the West, their red inhabitants, and the white man who should
carry the true, glad tidings westward, westward, ever from east
to west.&nbsp; Did she know how completely her whole spirit and
soul were surrendered to the worship of that devotion?&nbsp;
Worship?&nbsp; Yes, the word is advisedly used; Honora had once
given her spirit in homage to Schiller&rsquo;s self-sacrificing
Max; the same heart-whole veneration was now rendered to the
young missionary, multiplied tenfold by the hero being in a
tangible, visible shape, and not by any means inclined to thwart
or disdain the allegiance of the golden-haired girl.&nbsp; Nay,
as family connections frequently meeting, they had acted upon
each other&rsquo;s minds more than either knew, even when the
hour of parting had come, and words had been spoken which gave
Honora something more to cherish in the image of Owen Sandbrook
than even the hero and saint.&nbsp; There then she stood and
dreamt, pensive and saddened indeed, but with a melancholy
trenching very nearly on happiness in the intensity of its
admiration, and the vague ennobling future of devoted usefulness
in which her heart already claimed to share, as her person might
in some far away period on which she could not dwell.</p>
<p>A sound approached, a firm footstep, falling with strong
elasticity and such regular cadences, that it seemed to chime in
with the pine-tree music, and did not startle her till it came so
near that there was distinctive character to be discerned in the
tread, and then with a strange, new shyness, she would have <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>slipped away, but she had been seen, and Humfrey, with
his timber race in his hand, appeared on the path, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Ah, Honor, is it you come out to meet me, like old
times?&nbsp; You have been so much taken up with your friend
Master Owen that I have scarcely seen you of late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor did not move away, but she blushed deeply as she said,
&lsquo;I am afraid I did not come to meet you,
Humfrey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No?&nbsp; What, you came for the sake of a brown
study?&nbsp; I wish I had known you were not busy, for I have
been round all the woods marking timber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said she, rousing herself with some effort,
&lsquo;I wonder how many trees I should have saved from the
slaughter.&nbsp; Did you go and condemn any of my
pets?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of,&rsquo; said Humfrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have touched nothing near the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not even the old beech that was scathed with
lightning?&nbsp; You know papa says that is the touchstone of
influence; Sarah and Mr. West both against me,&rsquo; laughed
Honora, quite restored to her natural manner and confiding
ease.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The beech is likely to stand as long as you wish
it,&rsquo; said Humfrey, with an unaccustomed sort of
matter-of-fact gravity, which surprised and startled her, so as
to make her bethink herself whether she could have behaved ill
about it, been saucy to Sarah, or the like.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;have I made a
fuss&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Honor,&rsquo; he said, with deliberate kindness,
shutting up his knife, and putting it into his pocket;
&lsquo;only I believe it is time we should come to an
understanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More than ever did she expect one of his kind remonstrances,
and she looked up at him in expectation, and ready for defence,
but his broad, sunburnt countenance looked marvellously heated,
and he paused ere he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I find I can&rsquo;t spare you, Honora; you had better
stay at the Holt for good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her cheeks flamed, and
her heart galloped, but she could not let herself understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p11.jpg">
<img alt="I find I can&rsquo;t spare you, Honora"
src="images/p11.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor, you are old enough now, and I do not think you
need fear.&nbsp; It is almost your home already, and I believe I
can make you happy, with the blessing of God&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
He paused, but as she could not frame an answer in her
consternation, continued, &lsquo;Perhaps I should not have spoken
so suddenly, but I thought you would not mind me; I should like
to have had one word from my little Honor before I go to your
father, but don&rsquo;t if you had rather not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go to papa, please don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;
she cried, &lsquo;it would only make him sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Humfrey stood as if under an unexpected shock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! how came you to think of it?&rsquo; she said in her
distress; &lsquo;I never did, and it can never be&mdash;I am so
sorry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, my dear, do not grieve about it,&rsquo; said
Humfrey, only bent on soothing her; &lsquo;I dare say you are
quite right, you <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>are used to people in London much
more suitable to you than a stupid homely fellow like me, and it
was a foolish fancy to think it might be otherwise.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t cry, Honor dear, I can&rsquo;t bear that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Humfrey, only understand, please!&nbsp; You are the
very dearest person in the world to me after papa and mamma; and
as to fine London people, oh no, indeed!&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Owen Sandbrook; I understand,&rsquo; said
Humfrey, gravely.</p>
<p>She made no denial.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Honor,&rsquo; he anxiously exclaimed, &lsquo;you
are not going out in this wild way among the backwoods, it would
break your mother&rsquo;s heart; and he is not fit to take care
of you.&nbsp; I mean he cannot think of it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no, I could not leave papa and mamma; but some
time or other&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this arranged?&nbsp; Does your father know
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Humfrey, of course!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is an engagement?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Honora, sadly; &lsquo;papa said I was
too young, and he wished I had heard nothing about it.&nbsp; We
are to go on as if nothing had happened, and I know they think we
shall forget all about it!&nbsp; As if we could!&nbsp; Not that I
wish it to be different.&nbsp; I know it would be wicked to
desert papa and mamma while she is so unwell.&nbsp; The truth is,
Humfrey,&rsquo; and her voice sank, &lsquo;that it cannot be
while they live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor little Honor!&rsquo; he said, in a tone of the
most unselfish compassion.</p>
<p>She had entirely forgotten his novel aspect, and only thought
of him as the kindest friend to whom she could open her
heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t pity me,&rsquo; she said in exultation;
&lsquo;think what it is to be his choice.&nbsp; Would I have him
give up his aims, and settle down in the loveliest village in
England?&nbsp; No, indeed, for then it would not be Owen!&nbsp; I
am happier in the thought of him than I could be with everything
present to enjoy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you will continue to find it so,&rsquo; he said,
repressing a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be ashamed of myself if I did not,&rsquo; she
continued with glistening eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Should not I have
patience to wait while he is at his real glorious labour?&nbsp;
And as to home, that&rsquo;s not altered, only better and
brighter for the definite hope and aim that will go through
everything, and make me feel all I do a preparation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you know him well,&rsquo; said Humfrey; &lsquo;you
saw him constantly when he was at Westminster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, and always!&nbsp; Why, Humfrey, it is my great
glory and pleasure to feel that he formed me!&nbsp; When he went
to Oxford, he brought me home all the thoughts that have been my
better life.&nbsp; All my dearest books we read together, and
what used to look dry and cold, gained light and life after he
touched it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&lsquo;Yes, I see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His tone reminded her of what had passed, and she said,
timidly, &lsquo;I forgot!&nbsp; I ought not!&nbsp; I have vexed
you, Humfrey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, in his full tender voice; &lsquo;I
see that it was vain to think of competing with one of so much
higher claims.&nbsp; If he goes on in the course he has chosen,
yours will have been a noble choice, Honor; and I believe,&rsquo;
he added, with a sweetness of smile that almost made her forgive
the <i>if</i>, &lsquo;that you are one to be better pleased
<i>so</i> than with more ordinary happiness.&nbsp; I have no
doubt it is all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Humfrey, you are so good!&rsquo; she said, struck
with his kind resignation, and utter absence of acerbity in his
disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forget this, Honora,&rsquo; he said, as they were
coming to the end of the pine wood; &lsquo;let us be as we were
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora gladly promised, and excepting for her wonder at such a
step on the part of the cousin whose plaything and pet she had
hitherto been, she had no temptation to change her manner.&nbsp;
She loved him as much as ever, but only as a kind elder brother,
and she was glad that he was wise enough to see his immeasurable
inferiority to the young missionary.&nbsp; It was a wonderful
thing, and she was sorry for his disappointment; but after all,
he took it so quietly that she did not think it could have hurt
him much.&nbsp; It was only that he wanted to keep his pet in the
country.&nbsp; He was not capable of love like Owen
Sandbrook&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Years passed on.&nbsp; Rumour had bestowed Mr. Charlecote of
Hiltonbury on every lady within twenty miles, but still in
vain.&nbsp; His mother was dead, his sister married to an old
college fellow, who had waited half a lifetime for a living, but
still he kept house alone.</p>
<p>And open house it was, with a dinner-table ever expanding for
chance guests, strawberry or syllabub feasts half the summer, and
Christmas feasts extending wide on either side of the twelve
days.&nbsp; Every one who wanted a holiday was free of the Holt;
young sportsmen tried their inexperienced guns under the
squire&rsquo;s patient eye; and mammas disposed of their children
for weeks together, to enjoy the run of the house and garden, and
rides according to age, on pony, donkey, or Mr. Charlecote.&nbsp;
No festivity in the neighbourhood was complete without his
sunshiny presence; he was wanted wherever there was any family
event; and was godfather, guardian, friend, and adviser of
all.&nbsp; Every one looked on him as a sort of exclusive
property, yet he had room in his heart for all.&nbsp; As a
magistrate, he was equally indispensable in county government,
and a charity must be undeserving indeed that had not Humfrey
Charlecote, Esq., on the committee.&nbsp; In his own parish he
was a beneficent monarch; on his own estate a mighty farmer,
owning that his relaxation and delight were his turnips, his
bullocks, and machines; and <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>so content
with them, and with his guests, that Honora never recollected
that walk in the pine woods without deciding that to have
monopolized him would have been an injury to the public, and
perhaps less for his happiness than this free, open-hearted
bachelor life.&nbsp; Seldom did she recall that scene to mind,
for she had never been by it rendered less able to trust to him
as her friend and protector, and she stood in need of his
services and his comfort, when her father&rsquo;s death had left
him the nearest relative who could advise or transact business
for her and her mother.&nbsp; Then, indeed, she leant on him as
on the kindest and most helpful of brothers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Charlecote was too much acclimatized to the city to be
willing to give up her old residence, and Honor not only loved it
fondly, but could not bear to withdraw from the local charities
where her tasks had hitherto lain; and Woolstone-lane, therefore,
continued their home, though the summer and autumn usually took
them out of London.</p>
<p>Such was the change in Honora&rsquo;s outward life.&nbsp; How
was it with that inmost shrine where dwelt her heart and
soul?&nbsp; A copious letter writer, Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s
correspondence never failed to find its way to her, though they
did not stand on such terms as to write to one another; and in
those letters she lived, doing her day&rsquo;s work with cheerful
brightness, and seldom seeming preoccupied, but imagination,
heart, and soul were with his mission.</p>
<p>Very indignant was she when the authorities, instead of
sending him to the interesting children of the forests, thought
proper to waste him on mere colonists, some of them Yankee, some
Presbyterian Scots.&nbsp; He was asked insolent, nasal questions,
his goods were coolly treated as common property, and it was
intimated to him on all hands that as Englishman he was little in
their eyes, as clergyman less, as gentleman least of all.&nbsp;
Was this what he had sacrificed everything for?</p>
<p>By dint of strong complaints and entreaties, after he had
quarrelled with most of his flock, he accomplished an exchange
into a district where red men formed the chief of his charge; and
Honora was happy, and watched for histories of noble braves,
gallant hunters, and meek-eyed squaws.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly she gathered that the picturesque deer-skins
had become dirty blankets, and that the diseased, filthy,
sophisticated savages were among the worst of the pitiable
specimens of the effect of contact with the most evil side of
civilization.&nbsp; To them, as Owen wrote, a missionary was only
a white man who gave no brandy, and the rest of his parishioners
were their obdurate, greedy, trading tempters!&nbsp; It had been
a shame to send him to such a hopeless set, when there were
others on whom his toils would not be thrown away.&nbsp; However,
he should do his best.</p>
<p>And Honor went on expecting the wonders his best would work,
only the more struck with admiration by hearing that <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the
locality was a swamp of luxuriant vegetation, and equally
luxuriant fever and ague; and the letter he wrote thence to her
mother on the news of their loss did her more good than all
Humfrey&rsquo;s considerate kindness.</p>
<p>Next, he had had the ague, and had gone to Toronto for change
of air.&nbsp; Report spoke of Mr. Sandbrook as the most popular
preacher who had appeared in Toronto for years, attracting
numbers to his pulpit, and sending them away enraptured by his
power of language.&nbsp; How beautiful that a man of such
talents, always so much stimulated by appreciation, should give
up all this most congenial scene, and devote himself to his
obscure mission!</p>
<p>Report said more, but Honora gave it no credit till old Mr.
Sandbrook called one morning in Woolstone-lane, by his
nephew&rsquo;s desire, to announce to his friends that he had
formed an engagement with Miss Charteris, the daughter of a
general officer there in command.</p>
<p>Honor sat out all the conversation; and Mrs. Charlecote did
not betray herself; though, burning with a mother&rsquo;s wrath,
she did nothing worse than hope they would be happy.</p>
<p>Yet Honor had not dethroned the monarch of her
imagination.&nbsp; She reiterated to herself and to her mother
that she had no ground of complaint, that it had been understood
that the past was to be forgotten, and that Owen was far more
worthily employed than in dwelling on them.&nbsp; No blame could
attach to him, and it was wise to choose one accustomed to the
country and able to carry out his plans.&nbsp; The personal
feeling might go, but veneration survived.</p>
<p>Mrs. Charlecote never rested till she had learnt all the
particulars.&nbsp; It was a dashing, fashionable family, and Miss
Charteris had been the gayest of the gay, till she had been
impressed by Mr. Sandbrook&rsquo;s ministrations.&nbsp; From pope
to lover, Honor knew how easy was the transition; but she
zealously nursed her admiration for the beauty, who was
exchanging her gaieties for the forest missions; she made her
mother write cordially, and send out a pretty gift, and treated
as a personal affront all reports of the Charteris
disapprobation, and of the self-will of the young people.&nbsp;
They were married, and the next news that Honora heard was, that
the old general had had a fit from passion; thirdly, came tidings
that the eldest son, a prosperous M.P., had not only effected a
reconciliation, but had obtained a capital living for Mr.
Sandbrook, not far from the family seat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Charlecote declared that her daughter should not stay in
town to meet the young couple, and Honora&rsquo;s resistance was
not so much dignity, as a feverish spirit of opposition, which
succumbed to her sense of duty, but not without such wear and
tear of strained cheerfulness and suppressed misery, that when at
length her mother had brought her away, the fatigue of the
journey completed the work, and she was prostrated for weeks by
low fever.&nbsp; The blow had fallen.&nbsp; He had put his hand
to <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the plough and looked back.&nbsp; Faithlessness towards
herself had been passed over unrecognized, faithlessness towards
his self-consecration was quite otherwise.&nbsp; That which had
absorbed her affections and adoration had proved an unstable,
excitable being!&nbsp; Alas! would that long ago she had opened
her eyes to the fact that it was her own lofty spirit, not his
steadfastness, which had first kept it out of the question that
the mission should be set aside for human love.&nbsp; The crash
of her idolatry was the greater because it had been so highly
pitched, so closely intermingled with the true worship.&nbsp; She
was long ill, the past series of disappointments telling when her
strength was reduced; and for many a week she would lie still and
dreamy, but fretted and wearied, so as to control herself with
difficulty when in the slightest degree disturbed, or called upon
to move or think.&nbsp; When her strength returned under her
mother&rsquo;s tender nursing the sense of duty revived.&nbsp;
She thought her youth utterly gone with the thinning of her hair
and the wasting of her cheeks, but her mother must be the object
of her care and solicitude, and she would exert herself for her
sake, to save her grief, and hide the wound left by the rending
away of the jewel of her heart.&nbsp; So she set herself to seem
to like whatever her mother proposed, and she acted her interest
so well that insensibly it became real.&nbsp; After all, she was
but four-and-twenty, and the fever had served as an expression of
the feeling that would have its way: she had had a long rest,
which had relieved the sense of pent-up and restrained suffering,
and vigour and buoyancy were a part of her character; her tone
and manner resumed their cheerfulness, her spirits came back,
though still with the dreary feeling that the hope and aim of
life were gone, when she was left to her own musings; she was
little changed, and went on with daily life, contented and lively
over the details, and returning to her interest in reading, in
art, poetry, and in all good works, while her looks resumed their
brightness, and her mother congratulated herself once more on the
rounded cheek and profuse curls.</p>
<p>At the year&rsquo;s end Humfrey Charlecote renewed his
proposal.&nbsp; It was no small shock to find herself guilty of
his having thus long remained single, and she was touched by his
kind forbearance, but there was no bringing herself either to
love him, or to believe that he loved her, with such love as had
been her vision.&nbsp; The image around which she had bound her
heart-strings came between him and her, and again she begged his
pardon, and told him she liked him too well as he was to think of
him in any other light.&nbsp; Again he, with the most tender
patience and humility, asked her to forgive him for having
harassed her, and betrayed so little chagrin that she ascribed
his offer to generous compassion at her desertion.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Seven years more, and Honora was in mourning for her
mother.&nbsp; She was alone in the world, without any near or
precious claim, those clinging tendrils of her heart rent from
their oldest, surest earthly stay, and her time left vacant from
her dearest, most constant occupation.&nbsp; Her impulse was to
devote herself and her fortune at once to the good work which
most engaged her imagination, but Humfrey Charlecote, her sole
relation, since heart complaint had carried off his sister Sarah,
interfered with the authority he had always exercised over her,
and insisted on her waiting one full year before pledging herself
to anything.&nbsp; At one-and-thirty, with her golden hair and
light figure, her delicate skin and elastic step, she was still
too young to keep house in solitude, and she invited to her home
a friendless old governess of her own, sick at heart with
standing for the Governess&rsquo;s Institution, promising her a
daughter&rsquo;s care and attendance on her old age.&nbsp; Gentle
old Miss Wells was but too happy in her new quarters, though she
constantly averred that she knew she should not continue there;
treated as injuries to herself all Honor&rsquo;s assertions of
the dignity of age and old maidishness, and remained convinced
that she should soon see her married.</p>
<p>Honora had not seen Mr. Sandbrook since his return from
Canada, though his living was not thirty miles from the
City.&nbsp; There had been exchanges of calls when he had been in
London, but these had only resulted in the leaving of cards; and
from various causes she had been unable to meet him at
dinner.&nbsp; She heard of him, however, from their mutual
connection, old Mrs. Sandbrook, who had made a visit at
Wrapworth, and came home stored with anecdotes of the style in
which he lived, the charms of Mrs. Sandbrook, and the beauty of
the children.&nbsp; As far as Honora could gather, and very
unwillingly she did so, he was leading the life of an easy-going,
well-beneficed clergyman, not neglecting the parish, according to
the requirements of the day, indeed slightly exceeding them, very
popular, good-natured, and charitable, and in great request in a
numerous, demi-suburban neighbourhood, for all sorts of not
unclerical gaieties.&nbsp; The Rev. O. Sandbrook was often to be
met with in the papers, preaching everywhere and for everything,
and whispers went about of his speedy promotion to a situation of
greater note.&nbsp; In the seventh year of his marriage, his wife
died, and Honora was told of his overwhelming grief, how he
utterly refused all comfort or alleviation, and threw himself
with all his soul into his parish and his children.&nbsp; People
spoke <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of him as going about among the poor
from morning to night, with his little ones by his side,
shrinking from all other society, teaching them and nursing them
himself, and endeavouring to the utmost to be as both parents in
one.&nbsp; The youngest, a delicate infant, soon followed her
mother to the grave, and old Mrs. Sandbrook proved herself to
have no parent&rsquo;s heart by being provoked with his agonizing
grief for the &lsquo;poor little sickly thing,&rsquo; while it
was not in Honora&rsquo;s nature not to feel the more tenderly
towards the idol of her girlish days, because he was in
trouble.</p>
<p>It was autumn, the period when leaves fall off and grow damp,
and London birds of passage fly home to their smoky nests.&nbsp;
Honora, who had gone to Weymouth chiefly because she saw Miss
Wells would be disappointed if she did otherwise; when there, had
grown happily at home with the waves, and in talking to the old
fishermen; but had come back because Miss Wells thought it chilly
and dreary, and pined for London warmth and snugness.&nbsp; The
noonday sun had found the way in at the oriel window of the
drawing-room, and traced the reflection of the merchant&rsquo;s
mark upon the upper pane in distorted outline on the wainscoted
wall; it smiled on the glowing tints of Honora&rsquo;s hair, but
seemed to die away against the blackness of her dress, as she sat
by the table, writing letters, while opposite, in the brightness
of the fire, sat the pale, placid Miss Wells with her morning
nest of sermon books and needlework around her.</p>
<p>Honor yawned; Miss Wells looked up with kind anxiety.&nbsp;
She knew such a yawn was equivalent to a sigh, and that it was
dreary work to settle in at home again this first time without
the mother.</p>
<p>Then Honor smiled, and played with her pen-wiper.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it is comfortable to be at
home again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you will soon be able to feel so, my
dear,&rsquo; said the kind old governess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean it,&rsquo; said Honor cheerfully; then sighing,
&lsquo;But do you know, Mr. Askew wishes his curates to visit at
the asylum instead of ladies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Wells burst out into all the indignation that was in her
mild nature.&nbsp; Honor not to visit at the asylum founded
chiefly by her own father!</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a parish affair now,&rsquo; said Honor;
&lsquo;and I believe those Miss Stones and their set have been
very troublesome.&nbsp; Besides I think he means to change its
character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very inconsiderate of him,&rsquo; said Miss
Wells; &lsquo;he ought to have consulted you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every one loves his own charity the best,&rsquo; said
Honora; &lsquo;Humfrey says endowments are generally a mistake,
each generation had better do its own work to the utmost.&nbsp; I
wish Mr. Askew had not begun now, it was the work I specially
looked to, but I let it alone while&mdash;and he cannot be
expected&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&lsquo;I should have expected it of him though!&rsquo;
exclaimed Miss Wells, &lsquo;and he ought to know better!&nbsp;
How have you heard it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a note from him this morning,&rsquo; said
Honora; &lsquo;he asks me Humfrey Charlecote&rsquo;s address; you
know he and Mr. Sandbrook are trustees,&rsquo; and her voice grew
the sadder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I am not much mistaken, Mr. Charlecote will
represent to him his want of consideration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; said Honora; &lsquo;I should be
sorry to make the clergyman&rsquo;s hard task here any harder for
the sake of my feelings.&nbsp; Late incumbent&rsquo;s daughters
are proverbially inconvenient.&nbsp; No, I would not stand in the
way, but it makes me feel as if my work in St. Wulstan&rsquo;s
were done,&rsquo; and the tears dropped fast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear Honora!&rsquo; began the old lady, eagerly,
but her words and Honora&rsquo;s tears were both checked by the
sound of a bell, that bell within the court, to which none but
intimates found access.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange!&nbsp; It is the thought of old times, I
suppose,&rsquo; said Honor, smiling, &lsquo;but I could have said
that was Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s ring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely spoken, ere Mr. Sandbrook and Captain
Charteris were announced; and there entered a clergyman leading a
little child in each hand.&nbsp; How changed from the handsome,
hopeful youth from whom she had parted!&nbsp; Thin, slightly
bowed, grief-stricken, and worn, she would scarcely have known
him, and as if to hide how much she felt, she bent quickly, after
shaking hands with him, to kiss the two children, flaxen-curled
creatures in white, with black ribbons.&nbsp; They both shrank
closer to their father.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cilly, my love, Owen, my
man, speak to Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;she is a
very old friend of mine.&nbsp; This is my bonny little
housekeeper,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and here&rsquo;s a sturdy
fellow for four years old, is not he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl, a delicate fairy of six, barely accepted an embrace,
and clung the faster to her father, with a gesture as though to
repel all advance.&nbsp; The boy took a good stare out of a pair
of resolute gray eyes, with one foot in advance, and offered both
hands.&nbsp; Honora would have taken him on her knee, but he
retreated, and both leant against their father as he sat, an arm
round each, after shaking hands with Miss Wells, whom he
recollected at once, and presenting his brother-in-law, whose
broad, open, sailor countenance, hardy and weather-stained, was a
great contrast to his pale, hollow, furrowed cheeks and heavy
eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you tell me your name, my dear?&rsquo; said
Honora, feeling the children the easiest to talk to; but the
little girl&rsquo;s pretty lips pouted, and she nestled nearer to
her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her name is Lucilla,&rsquo; he answered with a sigh,
recalling that it had been his wife&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
are all somewhat of little savages,&rsquo; he added, in excuse
for the child&rsquo;s silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have seen few
strangers at Wrapworth of late.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&lsquo;I did not know you were in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a sudden measure&mdash;all my brother&rsquo;s
doing,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I am quite taken out of my own
guidance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went down to Wrapworth and found him very unwell,
quite out of order, and neglecting himself,&rsquo; said the
captain; &lsquo;so I have brought him up for advice, as I could
not make him hear reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was afraid you were looking very ill,&rsquo; said
Honora, hardly daring to glance at his changed face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t help being ill,&rsquo; returned Captain
Charteris, &lsquo;running about the village in all weathers in a
coat like that, and sitting down to play with the children in his
wet things.&nbsp; I saw what it would come to, last
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sandbrook could not repress a cough, which told plainly
what it was come to.</p>
<p>Miss Wells asked whom he intended to consult, and there was
some talk on physicians, but the subject was turned off by Mr.
Sandbrook bending down to point out to little Owen a beautiful
carving of a brooding dove on her nest, which formed the central
bracket of the fine old mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, my man, that pretty bird has been sitting there
ever since I can remember.&nbsp; How like it all looks to old
times!&nbsp; I could imagine myself running in from Westminster
on a saint&rsquo;s day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is little altered in some things,&rsquo; said
Honor.&nbsp; The last great change was too fresh!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Sandbrook, raising his eyes
towards her with the look that used to go so deep of old,
&lsquo;we have both gone through what makes the unchangeableness
of these impassive things the more striking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; said the little girl, pulling
his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me lift you up, my dear,&rsquo; said Honora; but
the child turned her back on her, and said,
&lsquo;Father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose, and was bending, at the little imperious voice,
though evidently too weak for the exertion, but the sailor made
one step forward, and pouncing on Miss Lucilla, held her up in
his arms close to the carving.&nbsp; The two little feet made
signs of kicking, and she said in anything but a grateful voice,
&lsquo;Put me down, Uncle Kit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Kit complied, and she retreated under her papa&rsquo;s
wing, pouting, but without another word of being lifted, though
she had been far too much occupied with struggling to look at the
dove.&nbsp; Meantime her brother had followed up her request by
saying &lsquo;me,&rsquo; and he fairly put out his arms to be
lifted by Miss Charlecote, and made most friendly acquaintance
with all the curiosities of the carving.&nbsp; The rest of the
visit was chiefly occupied by the children, to whom their father
was eager to show all that he had admired when little older than
they were, thus displaying a perfect and minute recollection and
affection for the place, which much gratified Honora.&nbsp; <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>The little girl began to thaw somewhat under the
influence of amusement, but there was still a curious
ungraciousness towards all attentions.&nbsp; She required those
of her father as a right, but shook off all others in a manner
which might be either shyness or independence; but as she was a
pretty and naturally graceful child, it had a somewhat engaging
air of caprice.&nbsp; They took leave, Mr. Sandbrook telling the
children to thank Miss Charlecote for being so kind to them,
which neither would do, and telling her, as he pressed her hand,
that he hoped to see her again.&nbsp; Honora felt as if an old
page in her history had been reopened, but it was not the page of
her idolatry, it was that of the fall of her idol!&nbsp; She did
not see in him the champion of the truth, but his presence
palpably showed her the excitable weakness which she had taken
for inspiration, while the sweetness and sympathy warmed her
heart towards him, and made her feel that she had underrated his
attractiveness.&nbsp; His implications that he knew she
sympathized with him had touched her greatly, and then he looked
so ill!</p>
<p>A note from old Mrs. Sandbrook begged her to meet him at
dinner the next day, and she was glad of the opportunity of
learning the doctor&rsquo;s verdict upon him, though all the time
she knew the meeting would be but pain, bringing before her the
disappointment not <i>of</i> him, but <i>in</i> him.</p>
<p>No one was in the drawing-room but Captain Charteris, who came
and shook hands with her as if they were old friends; but she was
somewhat amazed at missing Mrs. Sandbrook, whose formality would
be shocked by leaving her guests in the lurch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some disturbance in the nursery department, I
fancy,&rsquo; said the captain; &lsquo;those children have never
been from home, and they are rather exacting, poor
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little things!&rsquo; echoed Honora; then, anxious
to profit by the <i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i>, &lsquo;has Mr.
Sandbrook seen Dr. L.?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is just as I apprehended.&nbsp; Lungs very much
affected, right one nearly gone.&nbsp; Nothing for it but the
Mediterranean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no wonder.&nbsp; Since my poor sister died he has
never taken the most moderate care of his health, perfectly
revelled in dreariness and desolateness, I believe!&nbsp; He has
had this cough about him ever since the winter, when he walked up
and down whole nights with that poor child, and never would hear
of any advice till I brought him up here almost by
force.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it was time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May it be in time, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Italy does so much!&nbsp; But what will become of the
children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must go to my brother&rsquo;s of course.&nbsp; I
have told him I will see him there, but I will not have the
children!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not the least chance of his
mending, if they are to be always lugging him
about&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Sandbrook,
who looked a good deal worried, though she tried to put <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>it
aside, but on the captain saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that
you have troublesome guests, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; out it all came,
how it had been discovered late in the day that Master Owen
<i>must</i> sleep in his papa&rsquo;s room, in a crib to himself,
and how she had been obliged to send out to hire the necessary
articles, subject to his nurse&rsquo;s approval; and the
captain&rsquo;s sympathy having opened her heart, she further
informed them of the inconvenient rout the said nurse had made
about getting new milk for them, for which Honor could have found
it in her heart to justify her; &lsquo;and poor Owen is just as
bad,&rsquo; quoth the old lady; &lsquo;I declare those children
are wearing his very life out, and yet he will not hear of
leaving them behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was interrupted by his appearance at that moment, as
usual, with a child in either hand, and a very sad picture it
was, so mournful and spiritless was his countenance, with the
hectic tint of decay evident on each thin cheek, and those two
fair healthful creatures clinging to him, thoughtless of their
past loss, unconscious of that which impended.&nbsp; Little Owen,
after one good stare, evidently recognized a friend in Miss
Charlecote, and let her seat him upon her knee, listening to her
very complacently, but gazing very hard all the time at her, till
at last, with an experimental air, he stretched one hand and
stroked the broad golden ringlet that hung near him, evidently to
satisfy himself whether it really was hair.&nbsp; Then he found
his way to her watch, a pretty little one from Geneva, with
enamelled flowers at the back, which so struck his fancy that he
called out, &lsquo;Cilly, look!&rsquo;&nbsp; The temptation drew
the little girl nearer, but with her hands behind her back, as if
bent on making no advance to the stranger.</p>
<p>Honora thought her the prettiest child she had ever
seen.&nbsp; Small and lightly formed, there was more symmetry in
her little fairy figure than usual at her age, and the skin was
exquisitely fine and white, tinted with a soft eglantine pink,
deepening into roses on the cheeks; the hair was in long flaxen
curls, and the eyelashes, so long and fair that at times they
caught a glossy light, shaded eyes of that deep blue upon that
limpid white, which is like nothing but the clear tints of old
porcelain.&nbsp; The features were as yet unformed, but small and
delicate, and the upright Napoleon gesture had something
peculiarly quaint and pretty in such a soft-looking little
creature.&nbsp; The boy was a handsome fellow, with more solidity
and sturdiness, and Honora could scarcely continue to amuse him,
as she thought of the father&rsquo;s pain in parting with two
such beings&mdash;his sole objects of affection.&nbsp; A
moment&rsquo;s wish flashed across her, but was dismissed the
next moment as a mere childish romance.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Sandbrook came in, and various other guests arrived,
old acquaintance to whom Owen must be re-introduced, and he
looked fagged and worn by the time all the greetings had been
exchanged and all the remarks made on his children.&nbsp; When
dinner was announced, he remained to the last with them, and <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>did not appear in the dining-room till his uncle had had
time to look round for him, and mutter something discontentedly
about &lsquo;those brats.&rsquo;&nbsp; The vacant chair was
beside Honora, and he was soon seated in it, but at first he did
not seem inclined to talk, and leant back, so white and
exhausted, that she thought it kinder to leave him to
himself.</p>
<p>When, somewhat recruited, he said in a low voice something of
his hopes that his little Cilly, as he called her, would be less
shy another time, and Honora responding heartily, he quickly fell
into the parental strain of anecdotes of the children&rsquo;s
sayings and doings, whence Honora collected that in his
estimation Lucilla&rsquo;s forte was decision and Owen&rsquo;s
was sweetness, and that he was completely devoted to them,
nursing and teaching them himself, and finding his whole solace
in them.&nbsp; Tender pity moved her strongly towards him, as she
listened to the evidences of the desolateness of his home and his
heavy sorrow; and yet it was pity alone, admiration would not
revive, and indeed, in spite of herself, her judgment
<i>would</i> now and then respond &lsquo;unwise,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;weak,&rsquo; or &lsquo;why permit this?&rsquo; at details
of Lucilla&rsquo;s <i>mutinerie</i>.&nbsp; Presently she found
that his intentions were quite at variance with those of his
brother.&nbsp; His purpose was fixed to take the children with
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are very young,&rsquo; said Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but their nurse is a most valuable person, and can
arrange perfectly for them, and they will always be under my
eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was just what Captain Charteris seemed to
dread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He little knows,&rsquo; began Mr. Sandbrook, with a
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I know he is most averse to it, and he is
one who always carries his point, but he will not do so here; he
imagines that they may go to their aunt&rsquo;s nursery,
but,&rsquo; with an added air of confidence, &lsquo;that will
never do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora&rsquo;s eyes asked more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact,&rsquo; he said, as the flush of pain rose on
his cheeks, &lsquo;the Charteris children are not brought up as I
should wish to see mine.&nbsp; There are influences at work there
not suited for those whose home must be a country parsonage,
if&mdash;&nbsp; Little Cilly has come in for more admiration
there already than is good for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be easy for her not to meet with
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; said the gratified father, smiling
sadly; &lsquo;but Castle Blanch training might make the mischief
more serious.&nbsp; It is a gay household, and I cannot believe
with Kit Charteris that the children are too young to feel the
blight of worldly influence.&nbsp; Do not you think with me,
Nora?&rsquo; he concluded in so exactly the old words and manner
as to stir the very depths of her heart, but woe worth the change
from the hopes of youth to this premature fading into
despondency, and the implied farewell!&nbsp; She did think with
him completely, and felt the more for him, as she believed that
these Charterises had led him and his wife into the gaieties,
which since her death he had forsworn and abhorred as
temptations.&nbsp; She thought it hard <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that he
should not have his children with him, and talked of all the
various facilities for taking them that she could think of, till
his face brightened under the grateful sense of sympathy.</p>
<p>She did not hold the same opinion all the evening.&nbsp; The
two children made their appearance at dessert, and there began by
insisting on both sitting on his knees; Owen consented to come to
her, but Lucilla would not stir, though she put on some pretty
little coquettish airs, and made herself extremely amiable to the
gentleman who sat on her father&rsquo;s other hand, making smart
replies, that were repeated round the table with much
amusement.</p>
<p>But the ordinance of departure with the ladies was one of
which the sprite had no idea; Honor held out her hand for her;
Aunt Sandbrook called her; her father put her down; she shook her
curls, and said she should not leave father; it was stupid up in
the drawing-room, and she hated ladies, which confession set
every one laughing, so as quite to annihilate the effect of Mr.
Sandbrook&rsquo;s &lsquo;Yes, go, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Finally, he took the two up-stairs himself&mdash;the stairs
which, as he had told Honora that evening, were his greatest
enemies, and he remained a long time in their nursery, not coming
down till tea was in progress.&nbsp; Mrs. Sandbrook always made
it herself at the great silver urn, which had been a testimonial
to her husband, and it was not at first that she had a cup ready
for him.&nbsp; He looked even worse than at dinner, and Honora
was anxious to see him resting comfortably; but he had hardly sat
down on the sofa, and taken the cup in his hand, before a dismal
childish wail was heard from above, and at once he started up, so
hastily as to cough violently.&nbsp; Captain Charteris, breaking
off a conversation, came rapidly across the room just as he was
moving to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to those
imps&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen moved his head, and stepped forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll settle them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Renewed cries met his ears.&nbsp; &lsquo;No&mdash;a strange
place&mdash;&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
must&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his brother-in-law back with his hand, and was
gone.&nbsp; The captain could not contain his vexation,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way those brats serve him every
night!&rsquo; he exclaimed; &lsquo;they will not attempt to go to
sleep without him!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve found him writing his
sermon with the boy wrapped up in blankets in his lap;
there&rsquo;s no sense in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, during which Mr. Sandbrook did not
reappear, Captain Charteris muttered something about going to see
about him, and stayed away a good while.&nbsp; When he came down,
he came and sat down by Honora, and said, &lsquo;He is going to
bed, quite done for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must be better for him than talking
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what do you think I found?&nbsp; Those intolerable
brats would not stop crying unless he told them a story, and
there was he with his voice quite gone, coughing every two
minutes, <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>and romancing on with some allegory
about children marching on their little paths, and playing on
their little fiddles.&nbsp; So I told Miss Cilly that if she
cared a farthing for her father, she would hold her tongue, and I
packed her up, and put her into her nursery.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
mind me when she sees I will be minded; and as for little Owen,
nothing would satisfy him but his promising not to go away.&nbsp;
I saw that chap asleep before I came down, so there&rsquo;s no
fear of the yarn beginning again; but you see what chance there
is of his mending while those children are at him day and
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor things! they little know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One does not expect them to know, but one does expect
them to show a little rationality.&nbsp; It puts one out of all
patience to see him so weak.&nbsp; If he is encouraged to take
them abroad, he may do so, but I wash my hands of him.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t be responsible for him&mdash;let them go
alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora saw this was a reproach to her for the favour with
which she had regarded the project.&nbsp; She saw that the
father&rsquo;s weakness quite altered the case, and her former
vision flashed across her again, but she resolutely put it aside
for consideration, and only made the unmeaning answer, &lsquo;It
is very sad and perplexing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A perplexity of his own making.&nbsp; As for their not
going to Castle Blanch, they were always there in my poor
sister&rsquo;s time a great deal more than was good for any of
them, or his parish either, as I told him then; and now, if he
finds out that it is a worldly household, as he calls it, why,
what harm is that to do to a couple of babies like those?&nbsp;
If Mrs. Charteris does not trouble herself much about the
children, there are governesses and nurses enough for a
score!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must own,&rsquo; said Honora, &lsquo;that I think he
is right.&nbsp; Children are never too young for
impressions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Miss Charlecote, the way he
is going on is enough to ruin the best children in the
world.&nbsp; That little Cilly is the most arrant little flirt I
ever came across; it is like a comedy to see the absurd little
puss going on with the curate, ay, and with every parson that
comes to Wrapworth; and she sees nothing else.&nbsp;
Impressions!&nbsp; All she wants is to be safe shut up with a
good governess, and other children.&nbsp; It would do her a dozen
times more good than all his stories of good children and their
rocky paths, and boats that never sailed on any reasonable
principle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child,&rsquo; said Honora, smiling, &lsquo;she is
a little witch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; continued the uncle, &lsquo;if he thinks it
so bad for them, he had better take the only way of saving them
from it for the future, or they will be there for life.&nbsp; If
he gets through this winter, it will only be by the utmost
care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora kept her project back with the less difficulty, because
she doubted how it would be received by the rough captain; but it
won more and more upon her, as she rattled home through <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the
gas-lights, and though she knew she should learn to love the
children only to have the pang of losing them, she gladly cast
this foreboding aside as selfish, and applied herself impartially
as she hoped to weigh the duty, but trembling were the hands that
adjusted the balance.&nbsp; Alone as she stood, without a tie,
was not she marked out to take such an office of mere pity and
charity?&nbsp; Could she see the friend of her childhood forced
either to peril his life by his care of his motherless children,
or else to leave them to the influences he so justly
dreaded?&nbsp; Did not the case cry out to her to follow the
promptings of her heart?&nbsp; Ay, but might not, said caution,
her assumption of the charge lead their father to look on her as
willing to become their mother?&nbsp; Oh, fie on such selfish
prudery imputing such a thought to yonder broken-hearted, sinking
widower!&nbsp; He had as little room for such folly as she had
inclination to find herself on the old terms.&nbsp; The hero of
her imagination he could never be again, but it would be weak
consciousness to scruple at offering so obvious an act of
compassion.&nbsp; She would not trust herself, she would go by
what Miss Wells said.&nbsp; Nevertheless she composed her letter
to Owen Sandbrook between waking and sleeping all night, and
dreamed of little creatures nestling in her lap, and small hands
playing with her hair.&nbsp; How coolly she strove to speak as
she described the dilemma to the old lady, and how her heart
leapt when Miss Wells, her mind moving in the grooves traced out
by sympathy with her pupil, exclaimed, &lsquo;Poor little dears,
what a pity they should not be with you, my dear, they would be a
nice interest for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps Miss Wells thought chiefly of the brightening in her
child&rsquo;s manner, and the alert vivacity of eye and voice
such as she had not seen in her since she had lost her mother;
but be that as it might, her words were the very sanction so much
longed for, and ere long Honora had her writing-case before her,
cogitating over the opening address, as if her whole meaning were
implied in them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Owen&rsquo; came so naturally that it was too
like an attempt to recur to the old familiarity.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
dear Mr. Sandbrook?&rsquo;&nbsp; So formal as to be
conscious!&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Owen?&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes that was the
cousinly medium, and in diffident phrases of restrained
eagerness, now seeming too affectionate, now too cold she offered
to devote herself to his little ones, to take a house on the
coast, and endeavour to follow out his wishes with regard to
them, her good old friend supplying her lack of experience.</p>
<p>With a beating heart she awaited the reply.&nbsp; It was but
few lines, but all Owen was in them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Nora</span>&mdash;You always were an angel of goodness.&nbsp; I
feel your kindness more than I can express.&nbsp; If my darlings
were to be left at all, it should be with you, but I cannot
contemplate it.&nbsp; Bless you for the thought!</p>

27</span>She heard no more for a week, during which a dread of
pressing herself on him prevented her from calling on old Mrs.
Sandbrook.&nbsp; At last, to her surprise, she received a visit
from Captain Charteris, the person whom she looked on as least
propitious, and most inclined to regard her as an enthusiastic
silly young lady.&nbsp; He was very gruff, and gave a bad account
of his patient.&nbsp; The little boy had been unwell, and the
exertion of nursing him had been very injurious; the captain was
very angry with illness, child, and father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s one good
thing, L. has forbidden the children&rsquo;s perpetually hanging
on him, sleeping in his room, and so forth.&nbsp; With the
constitutions to which they have every right, poor things, he
could not find a better way of giving them the seeds of
consumption.&nbsp; That settles it.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he has not
the heart to hinder their always pawing him, so there&rsquo;s
nothing for it but to separate them from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And may I have them?&rsquo; asked Honor, too anxious to
pick her words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I told him I would come and see whether you were
in earnest in your kind offer.&nbsp; You would find them no
sinecure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a great happiness,&rsquo; said she,
struggling with tears that might prevent the captain from
depending on her good sense, and speaking calmly and sadly;
&lsquo;I have no other claims, nothing to tie me to any
place.&nbsp; I am a good deal older than I look, and my friend,
Miss Wells, has been a governess.&nbsp; <i>She</i> is really a
very wise, judicious person, to whom he may quite trust.&nbsp;
Owen and I were children together, and I know nothing that I
should like better than to be useful to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said the captain, more touched than he
liked to betray; &lsquo;well, it seems the only thing to which he
can bear to turn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she said, breaking off, but emotion and
earnestness looked glistening and trembling through every
feature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Captain Charteris,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad, at least, that there is some one to have
pity on the poor things!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s
wife, she doesn&rsquo;t say no, but she talks of convenience and
spoilt children&mdash;Sandbrook was quite right after all; I
would not tell him how she answered me!&nbsp; Spoilt children to
be sure they are, poor things, but she might recollect they have
no mother&mdash;such a fuss as she used to make with poor Lucilla
too.&nbsp; Poor Lucilla, she would never have believed that
&ldquo;dear Caroline&rdquo; would have no better welcome for her
little ones!&nbsp; Spoilt indeed!&nbsp; A precious deal
pleasanter children they are than any of the lot at Castle
Blanch, and better brought up too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good captain&rsquo;s indignation had made away with his
consistency, but Honora did not owe him a grudge for revealing
that she was his <i>pis aller</i>, she was prone to respect a man
who showed that he despised her, and she only cared to arrange
the details.&nbsp; He was anxious to carry away his charge at
once, since every day of this wear and tear of feeling was doing
incalculable <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>harm, and she undertook to receive
the children and nurse at any time.&nbsp; She would write at once
for a house at some warm watering-place, and take them there as
soon as possible, and she offered to call that afternoon to
settle all with Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Captain Charteris, &lsquo;I hardly
know.&nbsp; One reason I came alone was, that I believe that
little elf of a Cilly has some notion of what is plotting against
her.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t speak a word but that child catches
up, and she will not let her father out of her sight for a
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what is to be done?&nbsp; I would propose his
coming here; but the poor child would not let him go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the only chance.&nbsp; He has been forbidden
the walking with them in his arms to put them to sleep, and
we&rsquo;ve got the boy into the nursery, and he&rsquo;d better
be out of the house than hear them roaring for him.&nbsp; So if
you have no objection, and he is tolerable this evening, I would
bring him as soon as they are gone to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Owen was evidently falling under the management of
stronger hands than his own, and it could only be hoped that it
was not too late.&nbsp; His keeper brought him at a little after
eight that evening.&nbsp; There was a look about him as if, after
the last stroke that had befallen him, he could feel no more, the
bitterness of death was past, his very hands looked woe-begone
and astray, without the little fingers pressing them.&nbsp; He
could not talk at first; he shook Honor&rsquo;s hand as if he
could not bear to be grateful to her, and only the hardest hearts
could have endured to enter on the intended discussion.&nbsp; The
captain was very gentle towards him, and talk was made on other
topics but gradually something of the influence of the familiar
scene where his brightest days had been passed, began to
prevail.&nbsp; All was like old times&mdash;the quaint old silver
kettle and lamp, the pattern of the china cups, the ruddy play of
the fire on the polished panels of the room&mdash;and he began to
revive and join the conversation.&nbsp; They spoke of
Delaroche&rsquo;s beautiful Madonnas, one of which was at the
time to be seen at a print-shop&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr.
Sandbrook, &lsquo;and little Owen cried out as soon as he saw it,
&ldquo;That lady, the lady with the flowery
watch.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora smiled.&nbsp; It was an allusion to the old jests upon
her auburn locks, &lsquo;a greater compliment to her than to
Delaroche,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I saw that he was extremely
curious to ascertain what my carrots were made of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, Nora, I never saw more than one person
with such hair as yours,&rsquo; said Owen, with more animation,
&lsquo;and oddly enough her name turned out to be
Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible!&nbsp; Humfrey and I are the only
Charlecotes left that I know of!&nbsp; Where could it have
been?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was at Toronto.&nbsp; I must confess that I was
struck by the brilliant hair in chapel.&nbsp; Afterwards I met
her once or twice.&nbsp; She was a Canadian born, and had just
married a settler, whose name I can&rsquo;t remember, but her
maiden name <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>had certainly been Charlecote; I
remembered it because of the coincidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very curious; I did not know there had been any
Charlecotes but ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Humfrey Charlecote has never married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What made Owen raise his eyes at that moment, just so that she
met them? and why did that dreadful uncontrollable crimson heat
come mounting up over cheeks and temples, tingling and spreading
into her very neck, just because it was the most hateful thing
that could happen?&nbsp; And he saw it.&nbsp; She knew he did so,
for he dropped his eyes at once, and there was an absolute
silence, which she broke in desperation, by an incoherent attempt
to say something, and that ended by blundering into the tender
subject&mdash;the children; she found she had been talking about
the place to which she thought of taking them, a quiet spot on
the northern coast of Somersetshire.</p>
<p>He could bear the pang a little better now, and assented, and
the ice once broken, there were so many details and injunctions
that lay near his heart that the conversation never
flagged.&nbsp; He had great reliance on their nurse, and they
were healthy children, so that there was not much instruction as
regarded the care of their little persons; but he had a great
deal to say about the books they were to be taught from, the
hymns they were to learn, and the exact management required by
Lucilla&rsquo;s peculiar temper and decided will.&nbsp; The
theory was so perfect and so beautifully wise that Honora sat by
in reverence, fearing her power of carrying it out; and Captain
Charteris listened with a shade of satire on his face, and at
last broke out with a very odd grunt, as if he did not think this
quite what he had seen at Wrapworth parsonage.</p>
<p>Mr. Sandbrook coloured, and checked himself.&nbsp; Then after
a pause, he said in a very different tone, &lsquo;Perhaps so,
Kit.&nbsp; It is only too easy to talk.&nbsp; Nora knows that
there is a long way between my intentions and my
practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The humble dejection of that tone touched her more than she
had been touched since he had wrung her hand, long, long ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the captain, perceiving only that he
had given pain, &lsquo;I will say this for your monkeys, they do
<i>know</i> what is right at least; they have heard the articles
of war, which I don&rsquo;t fancy the other lot ever did.&nbsp;
As to the discipline, humph!&nbsp; It is much of a muchness, and
I&rsquo;m not sure but it is not the best at the
castle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The children are different at home,&rsquo; said Owen,
quietly; &lsquo;but,&rsquo; he added, with the same sad humility,
&lsquo;I dare say they will be much the better for the change; I
know&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he broke off, and put his hand before his eyes.</p>
<p>Honora hoped she should not be left alone with him, but
somehow it did happen.&nbsp; The captain went to bring the
carriage into the court, and get all imaginable wraps before
trusting him <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>out in the air, and Miss Wells
disappeared, probably intending kindness.&nbsp; Of course neither
spoke, till the captain was almost come back.&nbsp; Then Owen
rose from where he had been sitting listlessly, leaning back, and
slowly said, &lsquo;Nora, we did not think it would end thus when
I put my hand to the plough.&nbsp; I am glad to have been here
again.&nbsp; I had not remembered what I used to be.&nbsp; I do
not ask you to forgive me.&nbsp; You are doing so, returning me
good for&mdash;shall I say evil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor could not speak or look, she drooped her head, and her
hair veiled her; she held out her hand as the captain came in,
and felt it pressed with a feverish, eager grasp, and a murmured
blessing.</p>
<p>Honora did not see Mr. Sandbrook again, but Captain Charteris
made an incursion on her the next day to ask if she could receive
the children on the ensuing morning.&nbsp; He had arranged to set
off before daybreak, embarking for Ostend before the children
were up, so as to spare the actual parting, and Honora undertook
to fetch them home in the course of the day.&nbsp; He had hoped
to avoid their knowing of the impending separation but he could
only prevail so far as to extract a promise that they should not
know when it was to take place.&nbsp; Their father had told them
of their destination and his own as they sat on his bed in the
morning before he rose, and apparently it had gone off better
than could have been expected; little Owen did not seem to
understand, and his sister was a child who never shed tears.</p>
<p>The day came, and Honora awoke to some awe at the
responsibility, but with a yearning supplied, a vacancy filled
up.&nbsp; For at least six months she should be as a mother, and
a parent&rsquo;s prayers could hardly have been more earnest.</p>
<p>She had not long been dressed, when a hasty peal was heard at
the bell, and no sooner was the door opened than in hurried
Captain Charteris, breathless, and bearing a large plaid bundle
with tangled flaxen locks drooping at one end, and at the other
rigid white legs, socks trodden down, one shoe wanting.</p>
<p>He deposited it, and there stood the eldest child, her chin
buried in her neck, her fingers digging fast into their own
palms, her eyes gleaming fiercely at him under the pent-house she
had made of her brows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s an introduction!&rsquo; he said, panting
for breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Found her in time&mdash;the
Strand&mdash;laid flat on back seat, under all the plaids and
bags&mdash;her father put up his feet and found her&mdash;we
drove to the lane&mdash;I ran down with her&mdash;not a
moment&mdash;can&rsquo;t stay, good-bye, little Cilly goose, to
think she could go that figure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He advanced to kiss her, but she lifted up her shoulder
between him and her face, much as a pugnacious pigeon flap its
wings, and he retreated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wiser not, maybe!&nbsp; Look here,&rsquo; as Honora
hurried after him into the hall to ask after the patient;
&lsquo;if you have a bit of sticking-plaster, he had better not
see this.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Lucilla had made her little pearls of teeth meet in the
fleshy part of his palm.</p>
<p>Honora recoiled, shocked, producing the plaster from her
pocket in an instant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little vixen,&rsquo; he said, half laughing; &lsquo;but
I was thankful to her for neither kicking nor
struggling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; said Honora, &lsquo;perhaps it was
as much agony as passion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders as he held out his hand for her
operations, then hastily thanking her and wishing her good-bye,
rushed off again, as the astonished Miss Wells appeared on the
stairs.&nbsp; Honor shrank from telling her what wounds had been
received, she thought the gentle lady would never get over such a
proceeding, and, in fact, she herself felt somewhat as if she had
undertaken the charge of a little wild cat, and quite uncertain
what the young lady might do next.&nbsp; On entering the
breakfast-room, they found her sunk down all in a heap, where her
uncle had set her down, her elbows on a low footstool, and her
head leaning on them, the eyes still gazing askance from under
the brows, but all the energy and life gone from the little
dejected figure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child!&nbsp; Dear little thing&mdash;won&rsquo;t
you come to me?&rsquo;&nbsp; She stirred not.</p>
<p>Miss Wells advanced, but the child&rsquo;s only motion was to
shake her frock at her, as if to keep her off; Honora, really
afraid of the consequences of touching her, whispered that they
would leave her to herself a little.&nbsp; The silver kettle came
in, and tea was made.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucilla, my dear, the servants are coming in to
prayers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not offer to move, and still Honora let her alone, and
she remained in the same attitude while the psalm was read, but
afterwards there was a little approximation to kneeling in her
position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucilla, dear child, you had better come to
breakfast&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Only another defying glance.</p>
<p>Miss Wells, with what Honor thought defective judgment, made
pointed commendations of the tea, the butter and honey, but they
had no effect; Honora, though her heart ached for the wrench the
poor child had undergone, thought it best to affect indifference,
gave a hint of the kind, and scrupulously avoided looking round
at her, till breakfast was finished.&nbsp; When she did so, she
no longer met the wary defiant gleam of the blue eyes, they were
fast shut, the head had sunk on the arms, and the long breathings
of sleep heaved the little frame.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor little
dear!&rsquo; as Miss Wells might well exclaim, she had kept
herself wakeful the whole night that her father might not go
without her knowledge.&nbsp; And how pretty she looked in that
little black frock, so ill and hastily put on, one round white
shoulder quite out of it, and the long flaxen locks showing their
silky fineness as they hung dispersed and tangled, the pinky
flush of sleep upon the little face pillowed on the rosy pair of
arms, and with <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>a white unstockinged leg doubled
under her.&nbsp; Poor child, there was more of the angel than the
tiger-cat in her aspect now, and they had tears in their eyes,
and moved softly lest they should startle her from her rest.</p>
<p>But wakened she must be.&nbsp; Honora was afraid of
displeasing her domestic vizier, and rendering him for ever
unpropitious to her little guests if she deferred his removal of
the breakfast things beyond a reasonable hour.&nbsp; How was the
awaking to be managed?&nbsp; Fright, tears, passion, what change
would come when the poor little maid must awake to her
grief!&nbsp; Honora would never have expected so poetical a
flight from her good old governess as the suggestion, &lsquo;Play
to her;&rsquo; but she took it eagerly, and going to the disused
piano which stood in the room began a low, soft air.&nbsp; The
little sleeper stirred, presently raised her head, shook her hair
off her ears, and after a moment, to their surprise, her first
word was &lsquo;Mamma!&rsquo;&nbsp; Honora was pausing, but the
child said, &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; and sat for a few moments as
though recovering herself, then rose and came forward slowly
standing at last close to Honora.&nbsp; There was a pause, and
she said, &lsquo;Mamma did that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never was a sound more welcome!&nbsp; Honora dared to do what
she had longed for so much, put an arm round the little creature
and draw her nearer, nor did Lucilla resist, she only said,
&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you go on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can make prettier music in the other room, my dear;
we will go there, only you&rsquo;ve had no breakfast.&nbsp; You
must be very hungry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla turned round, saw a nice little roll cut into slices,
and remembered that she <i>was</i> hungry; and presently she was
consuming it so prosperously under Miss Wells&rsquo;s
superintendence that Honor ventured out to endeavour to retard
Jones&rsquo;s desire to &lsquo;take away,&rsquo; by giving him
orders about the carriage, and then to attend to her other
household affairs.&nbsp; By the time they were ended she found
that Miss Wells had brought the child into the drawing-room,
where she had at once detected the piano, and looking up at
Honora said eagerly &lsquo;Now then!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Honora
fulfilled her promise, while the child stood by softened and
gratified, until it was time to propose fetching little Owen,
&lsquo;your little brother&mdash;you will like to have him
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want my father,&rsquo; said Lucilla in a determined
voice, as if nothing else were to satisfy her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child, I know you do; I am so sorry for you, my
dear little woman, but you see the doctors think papa is more
likely to get better if he has not you to take care
of!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not want my father to take care of
<i>me</i>,&rsquo; said the little lady, proudly; &lsquo;I take
care of father, I always make his tea and warm his slippers, and
bring him his coffee in the morning.&nbsp; And Uncle Kit never
<i>will</i> put his gloves for him and warm his
handkerchief!&nbsp; Oh! what will he do?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The violent grief so long kept back was coming now, but not
freely; the little girl threw herself on the floor, and in a
tumult <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of despair and passion went on,
hurrying out her words, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very hard!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all Uncle Kit&rsquo;s doing!&nbsp; I hate him!&nbsp;
Yes, I do.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she rolled over and over in her
frenzy of feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear! my dear!&rsquo; cried Honora, kneeling by her,
&lsquo;this will never do!&nbsp; Papa would be very much grieved
to see his little girl so naughty.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know how
your uncle only wants to do him good, and to make him get
well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t he take me?&rsquo; said Lucilla,
gathering herself up, and speaking sullenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he thought you gave papa trouble, and tired
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, and it&rsquo;s not fair,&rsquo;
cried the poor child again; &lsquo;why couldn&rsquo;t he tell
me?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know papa was ill! he never told me so,
nor Mr. Pendy either; or, how I would have nursed him!&nbsp; I
wanted to do so much for him; I wouldn&rsquo;t have asked him to
tell me stories, nor nothing!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; And now they
won&rsquo;t let me take care of him;&rsquo; and she cried
bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said good, gentle Miss Wells, thinking more
of present comfort than of the too possible future; &lsquo;but
you will go back to take care of him some day, my dear.&nbsp;
When the spring comes papa will come back to his little
girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spring!&nbsp; It was a long way off to a mind of six years
old, but it made Lucilla look more amiably at Miss Wells.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And suppose,&rsquo; proceeded that good lady,
&lsquo;you were to learn to be as good and helpful a little girl
as can be while he is gone, and then nobody will wish to keep you
from him.&nbsp; How surprised he would be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then shall we go home?&rsquo; said Lucilla.</p>
<p>Miss Wells uttered a somewhat rash assurance to that effect,
and the child came near her, pacified and satisfied by the scheme
of delightful goodness and progress to be made in order to please
her father&mdash;as she always called him.&nbsp; Honor looked on,
thankful for the management that was subduing and consoling the
poor little maid, and yet unable to participate in it, for though
the kind old lady spoke in all sincerity, it was impossible to
Honora to stifle a lurking fear that the hopes built on the
prospect of his return had but a hollow foundation.</p>
<p>However it attracted Lucilla to Miss Wells, so that Honora did
not fear leaving her on going to bring home little Owen.&nbsp;
The carriage which had conveyed the travellers, had brought back
news of his sister&rsquo;s discovery and capture, and Honora
found Mrs. Sandbrook much shocked at the enormity of the
proceeding, and inclined to pity Honora for having charge of the
most outrageous children she had ever seen.&nbsp; A very long
letter had been left for her by their father, rehearsing all he
had before given of directions, and dwelling still more on some
others, but then apparently repenting of laying down the law, he
ended by entreating her to use her own judgment, believe in his
perfect confidence, and gratitude beyond expression for most
unmerited kindness.</p>
<p>Little Owen, she heard, had made the house resound with <!--
page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>cries when his father was nowhere to be found, but his
nurse had quieted him, and he came running to Honora with an
open, confiding face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you the lady?&nbsp; And
will you take me to Cilly and the sea?&nbsp; And may I have a
whale?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Honora did not venture on promising him a tame whale in
the Bristol Channel, she had him clinging to her in a moment,
eager to set off, to go to Cilly, and the dove he had seen at her
house.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty house here&mdash;I want to
come away,&rsquo; he said, running backwards and forwards between
her and the window to look at the horses, while nurse&rsquo;s
interminable boxes were being carried down.</p>
<p>The troubles really seemed quite forgotten; the boy sat on her
knee and chattered all the way to Woolstone-lane, and there he
and Lucilla flew upon each other with very pretty childish joy;
the sister doing the honours of the house in right of having been
a little longer an inmate.&nbsp; Nurse caught her and dressed and
combed her, shoed her and sashed her, so that she came down to
dinner less picturesque, but more respectable than at her first
appearance that morning, and except for the wonderful daintiness
of both children, dinner went off very well.</p>
<p>All did go well till night, and then Owen&rsquo;s woes
began.&nbsp; Oh what a piteous sobbing lamentation was it!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Daddy, daddy!&rsquo; not to be consoled, not to be
soothed, awakening his sister to the same sad cry, stilled only
by exhaustion and sleepiness.</p>
<p>Poor little fellow!&nbsp; Night after night it was the
same.&nbsp; Morning found him a happy, bright child, full of
engaging ways and innocent sayings, and quite satisfied with
&lsquo;Cousin Honor,&rsquo; but bed-time always brought back the
same wailing.&nbsp; Nurse, a tidy, brisk personage, with a
sensible, deferential tone to her superiors, and a caressing one
to the children, tried in vain assurances of papa&rsquo;s soon
coming back; nay, it might be feared that she held out that going
to sleep would bring the morrow when he was to come; but even
this delusive promise failed; the present was all; and Cousin
Honor herself was only not daddy, though she nursed him, and
rocked him in her arms, and fondled him, and told stories or sung
his lullaby with nightly tenderness, till the last sobs had
quivered into the smooth heavings of sleep.</p>
<p>Might only sea air and exercise act as a soporific!&nbsp; That
was a better chance than the new promise which Honora was vexed
to find nurse holding out to poor little Owen, that if he would
be a good boy, he was going to papa.&nbsp; She was puzzled how to
act towards a person not exactly under her authority, but she
took courage to speak about these false promises, and found the
remonstrance received in good part; indeed nurse used to talk at
much length of the children in a manner that implied great
affection for them, coupled with a sense that it would be an
excellent thing for them to be in such judicious hands.&nbsp;
Honor always came away from nurse in good humour with
herself.</p>
<p>The locality she had chosen was a sheltered village on the
north coast of Somerset, just where Exmoor began to give <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>grandeur to the outline in the rear, and in front the
Welsh hills wore different tints of purple or gray, according to
the promise of weather, Lundy Isle and the two lesser ones
serving as the most prominent objects, as they rose
from&mdash;Well, well! Honor counted herself as a Somersetshire
woman, and could not brook hearing much about the hue of the
Bristol Channel.&nbsp; At any rate, just here it had been so kind
as to wash up a small strip of pure white sand, fit for any
amount of digging for her children; and though Sandbeach was
watering-place enough to have the lodging-houses, butchers and
bakers, so indispensable to the London mind, it was not so much
in vogue as to be overrun by fine ladies, spoiling the children
by admiring their beauty.&nbsp; So said Miss Charlecote in her
prudence&mdash;but was not she just as jealous as nurse that
people should turn round a second time to look at those lovely
little faces?</p>
<p>That was a very happy charge to her and her good old
governess, with some drawbacks, indeed, but not such as to
distress her over much.&nbsp; The chief was at first Owen&rsquo;s
nightly sorrows, his daily idleness over lessons, Lucilla&rsquo;s
pride, and the exceeding daintiness of both children, which made
their meals a constant vexation and trouble.&nbsp; But what was
this compared with the charm of their dependence on her, and of
hearing that newly-invented pet name, &lsquo;Sweet Honey,&rsquo;
invoked in every little concern that touched them?</p>
<p>It was little Owen&rsquo;s name for her.&nbsp; He was her
special favourite&mdash;there was no concealing it.&nbsp; Lucilla
did not need her as much, and was of a vigorous, independent
nature, that would stand alone to the utmost.&nbsp; Owen gave his
affection spontaneously; if Lucilla&rsquo;s was won, it must be
at unawares.&nbsp; She was living in and for her absent father
now, and had nothing to spare for any one else, or if she had,
Miss Wells, who had the less claim on her was preferred to Cousin
Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Father&rsquo; was almost her religion; though
well taught, and unusually forward in religious knowledge, as far
as Honora dared to augur, no motive save her love for him had a
substantive existence, as touching her feelings or ruling her
actions.&nbsp; For him she said her prayers and learnt her hymns;
for him she consented to learn to hem handkerchiefs; for him were
those crooked letters for ever being written; nay, at the thought
of his displeasure alone could her tears be made to flow when she
was naughty; and for him she endeavoured to be less fanciful at
dinner, as soon as her mind had grasped the perception that her
not eating what was set before her might really hinder him from
always having her with him.&nbsp; She was fairly manageable, with
very high spirits, and not at all a silly or helpless child; but
though she obeyed Miss Charlecote, it was only as obeying her
father through her, and his constant letters kept up the strong
influence.&nbsp; In her most gracious moods, she was always
telling her little brother histories of what they should do when
they got home to father and <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Mr.
Prendergast; but to Owen, absence made a much greater
difference.&nbsp; Though he still cried at night, his
&lsquo;Sweet Honey&rsquo; was what he wanted, and with her
caressing him, he only dreaded her leaving him.&nbsp; He lavished
his pretty endearments upon her, and missed no one when he held
her hand or sat in her lap, stroking her curls, and exchanging a
good deal of fondling.&nbsp; He liked his hymns, and enjoyed
Scripture stories, making remarks that caused her to reverence
him; and though backward, idle, and sometimes very passionate,
his was exactly the legitimate character for a child, such as she
could deal with and love.&nbsp; She was as complete a slave to
the two little ones as their father could have been; all her
habits were made to conform to their welfare and pleasure, and
very happy she was, but the discipline was more decided than they
had been used to; there were habits to be formed, and others to
be broken, and she was not weak enough not to act up to her duty
in this respect, even though her heart was winding round that
sunny-faced boy as fast as it had ever clung to his father.&nbsp;
The new Owen Sandbrook, with his innocent earnestness, and the
spiritual light in his eyes, should fulfil all her dreams!</p>
<p>Christmas had passed; Mr. Sandbrook had begun to write to his
children about seeing them soon; Lucilla&rsquo;s slow hemming was
stimulated by the hope of soon making her present; and Honora was
marvelling at her own selfishness in dreading the moment when the
little ones would be no longer hers; when a hurried note of
preparation came from Captain Charteris.&nbsp; A slight
imprudence had renewed all the mischief, and his patient was
lying speechless under a violent attack of inflammation.&nbsp;
Another letter, and all was over.</p>
<p>A shock indeed! but in Honora&rsquo;s eyes, Owen Sandbrook had
become chiefly the children&rsquo;s father, and their future was
what concerned her most.&nbsp; How should she bear to part with
his darlings for ever, and to know them brought up in the way
that was not good, and which their father dreaded, and when their
orphanhood made her doubly tender over them?</p>
<p>To little Owen it was chiefly that papa was gone &lsquo;up
there&rsquo; whither all his hymns and allegories pointed, and at
his age, all that he did not actually see was much on a par; the
hope of meeting had been too distant for the extinction of it to
affect him very nearly, and he only understood enough to prompt
the prettiest and most touching sayings, wondering about the
doings of papa, mamma, and little baby among the angels, with as
much reality as he had formerly talked of papa among the
French.</p>
<p>Lucilla heard with more comprehension, but her gay temper
seemed to revolt against having sorrow forced on her.&nbsp; She
would not listen and would not think; her spirits seemed higher
than ever, and Honora almost concluded that either she did not
feel at all, or that the moment of separation had exhausted
all.&nbsp; Her character made Honora especially regret her
destiny; it was one only too congenial to the weeds that were
more likely <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>to be implanted, than plucked up, at
Castle Blanch.&nbsp; Captain Charteris had written to say that
he, and probably his brother, should come to Sandbeach to relieve
Miss Charlecote from the care of the children, and she prized
each day while she still had those dear little voices about the
house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sweet Honey,&rsquo; said Lucilla, who had been standing
by the window, apparently watching the rain, &lsquo;do Uncle
Charteris and Uncle Kit want us to go away from you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very much afraid they do, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nurse said, if you would ask them, we might
stay,&rsquo; said Lucilla, tracing the course of a drop with her
finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If asking would do any good, my dear,&rsquo; sighed
Honor; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t think nurse knows.&nbsp; You see,
you belong to your uncles now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t belong to Uncle Charteris!&rsquo; cried
Lucilla, passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go to Castle
Blanch!&nbsp; They were all cross to me; Ratia teased me, and
father said it was all their fault I was naughty, and he would
never take me there again!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let Uncle Kit go and
take me there!&rsquo; and she clung to her friend, as if the
recollection of Uncle Kit&rsquo;s victory by main force hung
about her still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t, my child, if I can help
it; but it will all be as your dear father may have fixed it, and
whatever he wishes I know that his little girl will
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many a dim hope did Honora revolve, and more than ever did she
feel as if a piece of her heart would be taken away, for the
orphans fastened themselves upon her, and little Owen stroked her
face, and said naughty Uncle Kit should not take them away.&nbsp;
She found from the children and nurse that about a year ago, just
after the loss of the baby, there had been a most unsuccessful
visit at Castle Blanch; father and little ones had been equally
miserable there in the separation of the large establishment, and
Lucilla had been domineeringly petted by her youngest cousin,
Horatia, who chose to regard her as a baby, and coerced her by
bodily force, such as was intolerable to so high-spirited a
child, who was a little woman at home.&nbsp; She had resisted,
and fallen into dire disgrace, and it was almost with horror that
she regarded the place and the cousinhood.&nbsp; Nurse appeared
to have some private disgust of her own, as well as to have much
resented her children&rsquo;s being convicted of naughtiness, and
she spoke strongly in confidence to Honora of the ungodly ways of
the whole household, declaring that after the advantages she had
enjoyed with her dear master, she could not bear to live there,
though she might&mdash;yes, she <i>must</i> be with the dear
children just at first, and she ventured to express strong wishes
for their remaining in their present home, where they had been so
much improved.</p>
<p>The captain came alone.&nbsp; He walked in from the inn just
before luncheon, with a wearied, sad look about him, as if he had
suffered a good deal; he spoke quietly and slowly, and when the
children came in, he took them up in his arms and <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>kissed them very tenderly.&nbsp; Lucilla submitted more
placably than Honor expected, but the moment they were set down
they sprang to their friend, and held by her dress.&nbsp; Then
came the meal, which passed off with small efforts at making
talk, but with nothing memorable except the captain&rsquo;s
exclamation at the end&mdash;&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the first
time I ever dined with you children without a fuss about the
meat.&nbsp; Why, Cilly, I hardly know you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the appetites are better for the sea
air,&rsquo; said Honor, not that she did not think it a great
achievement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it has been a troublesome
charge,&rsquo; said the captain, laying his hand on his
niece&rsquo;s shoulder, which she at once removed, as disavowing
his right in her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it has made me so happy,&rsquo; said Honor, hardly
trusting her voice; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to yield it
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those understanding eyes of Lucilla&rsquo;s were drinking in
each word, but Uncle Kit ruthlessly said&mdash;&lsquo;There,
it&rsquo;s your walking time, children; you go out
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora followed up his words with her orders, and Lucille
obeyed, only casting another wistful look, as if she knew her
fate hung in the scales.&nbsp; It was showing tact such as could
hardly have been expected from the little impetuous termagant,
and was the best pleading for her cause, for her uncle&rsquo;s
first observation was&mdash;&lsquo;A wonder!&nbsp; Six months
back, there would have been an explosion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you think them improved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Civilized beings, not plagues.&nbsp; You have been very
good to them;&rsquo; and as she intimated her own pleasure in
them, he continued&mdash;&lsquo;It will be better for them at
Castle Blanch to have been a little broken in; the change from
his indulgence would have been terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were possible to leave them with me, I should be
so happy,&rsquo; at length gasped Honora, meeting an inquiring
dart from the captain&rsquo;s eyes, as he only made an
interrogative sound as though to give himself time to think, and
she proceeded it broken sentences&mdash;&lsquo;If their uncle and
aunt did not so very much wish for them&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I
could&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Captain Charteris, apparently so
little aided by his thoughts as to see no hope of overcoming his
perplexity without expressing it, &lsquo;the truth is that,
though I had not meant to say anything of it, for I think
relations should come first, I believe poor Sandbrook would have
preferred it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while her colour deepened, and she
locked her trembling fingers together to keep them still, he went
on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes! you can&rsquo;t think how often I called
myself a dozen fools for having parted him from his
children!&nbsp; Never held up his head again!&nbsp; I could get
him to take interest in nothing&mdash;every child he saw he was
only comparing to one or other of them.&nbsp; After the year
turned, and he talked of coming home, he was more cheerful; but
strangely enough, for those last days at Hy&egrave;res, though he
seemed better, his spirits sank unaccountably, and he
<i>would</i> talk more of the <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>poor little
thing that he lost than of these!&nbsp; Then he had a letter from
you which set him sighing, and wishing they could always have
such care!&nbsp; Altogether, I thought to divert him by taking
him on that expedition, but&mdash;&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve been
provoked with him many a time, but there was more of the <i>real
thing</i> in him than in the rest of us, and I feel as if the
best part of our family were gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this was all?&nbsp; He was too ill to say much
afterwards?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t speak when he rang in the morning!&nbsp;
Was gone by that time next day.&nbsp; Now,&rsquo; added the
captain, after a silence, &lsquo;I tell you candidly that my
feeling is that the ordinary course is right.&nbsp; I think
Charles ought to take the children, and the children ought to be
with Charles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you think so,&rsquo; began Honor, with failing
hopes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the same time,&rsquo; continued he, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be so happy or so well cared for
as by you, and knowing poor Owen&rsquo;s wishes, I should not
feel justified in taking them away, since you are so good as to
offer to keep them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor eagerly declared herself much obliged, then thought it
sounded ironical.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless,&rsquo; he proceeded, &lsquo;Charles should
strongly feel it his duty to take them home, in which
case&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, of course I could say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then we&rsquo;ll leave it to his
decision.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it remained, and in trembling Honora awaited the
answer.</p>
<p>It was in her favour that he was appointed to a ship, since he
was thus excluded from exercising any supervision over them at
Castle Blanch, and shortly after, letters arrived gratefully
acceding to her request.&nbsp; Family arrangements and an
intended journey made her proposal doubly welcome, for the
present at least, and Mrs. Charteris was full of polite
thanks.</p>
<p>Poor little waifs and strays!&nbsp; No one else wanted them,
but with her at least they had a haven of refuge, and she loved
them the more ardently for their forlorn condition.&nbsp; Her own
as they had never before been! and if the tenure were uncertain,
she prized it doubly, even though, by a strange fatality, she had
never had so much trouble and vexation with them as arose at once
on their being made over to her!&nbsp; When all was settled,
doubt over, and the routine life begun, Lucilla evidently felt
the blank of her vanished hopes, and became fretful and captious,
weary of things in general, and without sufficient motive to
control her natural taste for the variety of naughtiness!&nbsp;
Honor had not undertaken the easiest of tasks, but she neither
shrank from her enterprise nor ceased to love the fiery little
flighty sprite, the pleasing torment of her life&mdash;she loved
her only less than that model of childish sweetness, her little
Owen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, dear child, don&rsquo;t take your brother
there.&nbsp; Owen dear, come back, don&rsquo;t you see the mud?
you&rsquo;ll sink in.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m only getting a dear little crab, Sweet
Honey,&rsquo; and the four little feet went deeper and deeper
into the black mud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t have it done! come back, children, I
desire, directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy would have turned, but his sister had hold of his
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Owen, there he is!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
him,&rsquo; and as the crab scuttled sidelong after the
retreating tide, on plunged the children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, come here!&rsquo; cried the unfortunate old hen,
as her ducklings took to the black amphibious mass, but not a
whit did Lucilla heed.&nbsp; In the ardour of the chase, on she
went, unheeding, leaving her brother sticking half way, where
having once stopped, he began to find it difficult to withdraw
his feet, and fairly screamed to &lsquo;Sweet Honey&rsquo; for
help.&nbsp; His progress was not beyond what a few long vigorous
steps of hers could come up with, but deeply and blackly did she
sink, and when she had lifted her truant out of his two holes,
the increased weight made her go ankle deep at the first tread,
and just at the same moment a loud shriek proclaimed that
Lucilla, in hey final assault on the crab, had fallen flat on a
yielding surface, where each effort to rise sank her deeper, and
Honora almost was expecting in her distress to see her disappear
altogether, ere the treacherous mud would allow her to come to
the rescue.&nbsp; But in that instant of utmost need, ere she
could set down the little boy, a gentleman, with long-legged
strides, had crossed the intervening space, and was bearing back
the young lady from her mud bath.&nbsp; She raised her eyes to
thank him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Humfrey!&rsquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor! so it was you, was it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d no notion
of it!&rsquo; as he placed on her feet the little maiden,
encrusted with mud from head to foot, while the rest of the party
were all apparently cased in dark buskins of the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to see me and my children?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am ashamed you should find us under such circumstances!
though I don&rsquo;t know what would have become of us
otherwise.&nbsp; No, Lucy, you are too disobedient for any one to
take notice of you yet&mdash;you must go straight home, and be
cleaned, and not speak to Mr. Charlecote till you are quite
good.&nbsp; Little Owen, here he is&mdash;he was quite led into
it.&nbsp; But how good of you to come, Humfrey: where are
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the hotel&mdash;I had a mind to come and see how you
were getting on, and I&rsquo;d had rather more than usual to do
of late, so I thought I would take a holiday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked on talking for some seconds, when presently as the
squire&rsquo;s hand hung down, a little soft one stole into it,
and made him exclaim with a start, &lsquo;I thought it was
Ponto&rsquo;s nose!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But though very fond of children, he took up his hand, and did
not make the slightest response to the sly overture of the small
coquette, the effect as Honor well knew of opposition quite as
much as of her strong turn for gentlemen.&nbsp; She pouted a
little, and then marched on with &lsquo;don&rsquo;t care&rsquo;
determination, <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>while Humfrey and Honora began to
talk over Hiltonbury affairs, but were soon interrupted by Owen,
who, accustomed to all her attention, did not understand her
being occupied by any one else.&nbsp; &lsquo;Honey,
Honeypots,&rsquo; and a pull at her hand when she did not
immediately attend, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t the little crabs get
black legs like mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they only go where they ought,&rsquo; was the
extremely moral reply of the squire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Little boys
aren&rsquo;t meant to walk in black mud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The shrimp boys do go in the mud,&rsquo; shrewdly
pleaded Owen, setting Honor off laughing at Humfrey&rsquo;s
discomfited look of diversion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do to generalize,&rsquo; she said,
merrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Owen must be content to regard crabs and
shrimp boys as privileged individuals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen demanded whether when he was big he might be a shrimp
boy, and a good deal of fraternization had taken place between
him and Mr. Charlecote before the cottage was reached.</p>
<p>It was a very happy day to Honora; there was a repose and
trust to be felt in Humfrey&rsquo;s company, such as she had not
experienced since she had lost her parents, and the home sense of
kindred was very precious.&nbsp; Only women whose chief prop is
gone, can tell the value of one who is still near enough to
disapprove without ceremony.</p>
<p>The anxiety that Honor felt to prove to her cousin that it was
not a bit of romantic folly to have assumed her present charge,
was worth more than all the freedom of action in the world.&nbsp;
How much she wanted the children to show off to advantage! how
desirous she was that he should not think her injudicious! yes,
and how eager to see him pleased with their pretty looks!</p>
<p>Lucilla came down cleaned, curled, and pardoned, and certainly
a heart must have been much less tender than Humfrey
Charlecote&rsquo;s not to be touched by the aspect of those two
little fair waxen-looking beings in the deepest mourning of
orphanhood.&nbsp; He was not slow in making advances towards
them, but the maiden had been affronted, and chose to be slyly
shy and retiring, retreating to the other side of Miss Wells, and
there becoming intent upon her story-book, though many a gleam
through her eyelashes betrayed furtive glances at the stranger
whom Owen was monopolizing.&nbsp; And then she let herself be
drawn out, with the drollest mixture of arch demureness and
gracious caprice.&nbsp; Honora had never before seen her with a
gentleman, and to be courted was evidently as congenial an
element to her as to a reigning beauty.&nbsp; She was perfectly
irresistible to manhood, and there was no doubt, ere the evening
was over, that Humfrey thought her one of the prettiest little
girls he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He remained a week at Sandbeach, lodging at the inn, but
spending most of his time with Honor.&nbsp; He owned that he had
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>been unwell, and there certainly was a degree of
lassitude about him, though Honor suspected that his real motive
in coming was brotherly kindness and desire to see whether she
were suffering much from the death of Owen Sandbrook.&nbsp;
Having come, he seemed not to know how to go away.&nbsp; He was
too fond of children to become weary of their petty exactions,
and they both had a sort of passion for him; he built castles for
them on the beach, presided over their rides, took them out
boating, and made them fabulously happy.&nbsp; Lucilla had not
been so good for weeks, and the least symptom of an outbreak was
at once put down by his good-natured &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The evenings at the cottage with Honora and Miss Wells, music and
bright talk, were evidently very refreshing to him, and he put
off his departure from day to day, till an inexorable matter of
county business forced him off.</p>
<p>Not till the day was imminent, did the cousins quit the easy
surface of holiday leisure talk.&nbsp; They had been together to
the late evening service, and were walking home, when Honora
began abruptly, &lsquo;Humfrey, I wish you would not object to
the children giving me pet names.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not know that I had shown any
objection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if you did not impressively say Miss Charlecote on
every occasion when you mention me to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and is not it more respectful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not what I want.&nbsp; Where the natural
tie is wanting, one should do everything to make up for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you hope to do so by letting yourself be called
Honey-pots!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More likely than by sitting up distant and awful to be
<i>Miss Charlecoted</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever you might be called must become an
endearment,&rsquo; said Humfrey, uttering unawares one of the
highest compliments she had ever received, &lsquo;and I own I do
not like to hear those little chits make so free with your
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For my sake, or theirs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For both.&nbsp; There is an old saying about
familiarity, and I think you should recollect that, for the
children&rsquo;s own good, it is quite as needful to strengthen
respect as affection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you think I can do that by fortifying myself with
Miss Charlecote?&nbsp; Perhaps I had better make it Mrs. Honora
Charlecote at once, and get a high cap, a rod, and a pair of
spectacles, eh?&nbsp; No! if they won&rsquo;t respect me out of a
buckram suit, depend upon it they would find out it was a hollow
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Humfrey smiled.&nbsp; From her youth up, Honor could generally
come off in apparent triumph from an argument with him, but the
victory was not always where the triumph was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Humfrey,&rsquo; she said, after some pause,
&lsquo;do you think I am fit to be trusted with my two poor
children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a huskiness in his tone as he said, &lsquo;I am
sincerely glad you have the pleasure and comfort of
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&lsquo;I suspect there&rsquo;s a reservation
there.&nbsp; But really, Humfrey, I don&rsquo;t think I went out
searching for the responsibility in the way that makes it
dangerous.&nbsp; One uncle did not want them, and the other could
not have them, and it would have been mere barbarity in me not to
offer.&nbsp; Besides, their father wished&mdash;&rsquo; and her
voice faltered with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Humfrey, eagerly, &lsquo;I did
not in the least mean that it is not the kindest, most generous
requital,&rsquo; and there he broke off, embarrassed by the
sincere word that he had uttered, but before she had spoken an
eager negative&mdash;to what she knew not&mdash;he went on.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And of course I don&rsquo;t mean that you are not one to
manage them very well, and all that&mdash;only I hope there may
not be pain in store&mdash;I should not like those people to use
you for their nursery governess, and then take the children away
just as you had set your heart upon them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do
that, Honor,&rsquo; he added, with an almost sad earnestness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do what?&nbsp; Set my heart on them?&nbsp; Do you think
I can help loving the creatures?&rsquo; she said, with mournful
playfulness, &lsquo;or that my uncertain tenure does not make
them the greater darlings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are ways of loving without setting one&rsquo;s
heart,&rsquo; was the somewhat grave reply.</p>
<p>He seemed to be taking these words as equivalent to
transgressing the command that requires all our heart, and she
began quickly, &lsquo;Oh! but I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rsquo;
then a sudden thrill crossed her whether there might not be some
truth in the accusation.&nbsp; Where had erst the image of Owen
Sandbrook stood?&nbsp; First or second?&nbsp; Where was now the
image of the boy?&nbsp; She turned her words into &lsquo;Do you
think I am doing so&mdash;in a wrong way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor dear, I could not think of wrong where you are
concerned,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was only afraid of your
kindness bringing you pain, if you rest your happiness very much
upon those children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Honor, smiling, relieved.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank you, Humfrey; but you see I can&rsquo;t weigh out my
affection in that fashion.&nbsp; They will get it, the
rogues!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, as far as the girl is
concerned,&rsquo; said Humfrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are strict
enough with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how am I to be strict when poor little Owen never
does anything wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he is a particularly sweet child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And not at all wanting in manliness,&rsquo; cried
Honor, eagerly.&nbsp; &lsquo;So full of spirit, and yet so
gentle.&nbsp; Oh! he is a child whom it is a privilege to train,
and I don&rsquo;t think I have spoilt him yet, do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you have.&nbsp; He is very
obedient in general.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! if he could be only brought up as I wish.&nbsp; And
I do think his innocence is too perfect a thing not to be
guarded.&nbsp; What a perfect clergyman he would make!&nbsp; Just
fancy him devoting himself to some parish like poor dear old <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>St. Wulstan&rsquo;s&mdash;carrying his bright sweetness
into the midst of all that black Babel, and spreading light round
him! he always says he will be a clergyman like his papa, and I
am sure he must be marked out for it.&nbsp; He likes to look at
the sheep on the moors, and talk about the shepherd leading them,
and I am sure the meaning goes very deep with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was not going quite the way to show Humfrey that her heart
was not set on the boy, and she was checked by hearing him
sigh.&nbsp; Perhaps it was for the disappointment he foresaw, so
she said, &lsquo;Whether I bring him up or not, don&rsquo;t you
believe there will be a special care over such a
child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a special care over every Christian child, I
suppose,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and I hope it may all turn out so
as to make you happy.&nbsp; Here is your door; good night, and
good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, are not you coming in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not; I have my things to put up; I must go
early to-morrow.&nbsp; Thank you for a very happy week.&nbsp;
Good-bye, Honor.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a shade of disappointment
about his tone that she could not quite account for.&nbsp; Dear
old Humfrey!&nbsp; Could he be ageing?&nbsp; Could he be
unwell?&nbsp; Did he feel himself lonely?&nbsp; Could she have
mortified him, or displeased him?&nbsp; Honor was not a woman of
personal vanity, or a solution would sooner have occurred to
her.&nbsp; She knew, upon reflection, that it must have been for
her sake that Humfrey had continued single, but it was so
inconvenient to think of him in the light of an admirer, when she
so much needed him as a brother, that it had hardly ever occurred
to her to do so; but at last it did strike her whether, having
patiently waited so long, this might not have been a visit of
experiment, and whether he might not be disappointed to find her
wrapped up in new interests&mdash;slightly jealous, in fact, of
little Owen.&nbsp; How good he had been!&nbsp; Where was the
heart that could fail of being touched by so long a course of
forbearance and consideration?&nbsp; Besides Honor had been a
solitary woman long enough to know what it was to stand
alone.&nbsp; And then how well he would stand in a father&rsquo;s
place towards the orphans.&nbsp; He would never decree her
parting with them, and Captain Charteris himself must trust
him.&nbsp; Yet what a shame it would be to give such a devoted
heart nothing better than one worn out, with the power of love
such as he deserved, exhausted for ever.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;something very odd bounded up within her, and told her
between shame and exultation, that faithful old Humfrey would not
be discontented even with what she had to give.&nbsp; Another
time&mdash;a little, a very little encouragement, and the pine
wood scene would come back again, and then&mdash;her heart
fainted a little&mdash;there should be no concealment&mdash;but
if she could only have been six months married all at once!</p>
<p>Time went on, and Honora more than once blushed at finding how
strong a hold this possibility had taken of her heart, when once
she had begun to think of resting upon one so kind, so <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>good,
so strong.&nbsp; Every perplexity, every care, every transaction
that made her feel her position as a single woman, brought round
the yearning to lay them all down upon him, who would only be
grateful to her for them.&nbsp; Every time she wanted some one to
consult, hope showed her his face beaming sweetly on her, and
home seemed to be again opening to her, that home which might
have been hers at any time these twelve years.&nbsp; She quite
longed to see how glad the dear, kind fellow would be.</p>
<p>Perhaps maidenly shame would have belied her feelings in his
actual presence, perhaps she would not have shrunk from him, and
been more cold than in her unconsciousness, but he came not; and
his absence fanned the spark so tardily kindled.&nbsp; What if
she had delayed till too late?&nbsp; He was a man whose duty it
was to marry! he had waited till he was some years past
forty&mdash;perhaps this had been his last attempt, and he was
carrying his addresses elsewhere.</p>
<p>Well! Honora believed she had tried to act rightly, and that
must be her comfort&mdash;and extremely ashamed of herself she
was, to find herself applying such a word to her own sensations
in such a case&mdash;and very much disliking the notion of any
possible lady at Hiltonbury Holt.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>A letter from Humfrey! how Honor&rsquo;s heart
fluttered.&nbsp; Would it announce an engagement, or would it
promise a visit on which her fate would turn, or would it be only
a business letter on her money matters?</p>
<p>Angry at her own trepidation, she opened it.&nbsp; It was none
of all these.&nbsp; It told her that Mr. Saville, his
brother-in-law, was staying at the Holt with his second wife, and
that he begged her to take advantage of this opportunity to come
to visit the old place, adding, that he had not been well, and he
wished much to see her, if she could spare a few days to him from
her children.</p>
<p>Little doubt had she as to the acceptance.&nbsp; The mere
words &lsquo;going to Hiltonbury,&rsquo; had power by force of
association to make her heart bound.&nbsp; She was a little
disappointed that he had not included the children; she feared
that it looked as if he were really ill; but it might be on
account of the Savilles, or maybe he had that to say to her
which&mdash;oh, nonsense!&nbsp; Were that the case, Humfrey would
not reverse the order of things, and make her come to him.&nbsp;
At any rate, the children should be her first condition.&nbsp;
And then she concentrated her anxieties on his most unusual
confession of having been unwell.</p>
<p>Humfrey&rsquo;s substantial person was ready to meet her at
the <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>station, and the first glance dispelled her nervous
tremors, and calmed the tossings of her mind in the habitual
sense of trust and reliance.&nbsp; He thanked her for coming,
handed her into the carriage, looked after her goods, and seated
himself beside her in so completely his ordinary fashion of
taking care of her, that she forgot all her intentions of
rendering their meeting momentous.&nbsp; Her first inquiry was
for his health, but he put it aside with something about feeling
very well now, and he looked so healthy, only perhaps a little
more hearty and burly, that she did not think any more of the
matter, and only talked in happy desultory scraps, now dwelling
on her little Owen&rsquo;s charms, now joyfully recognizing
familiar objects, or commenting upon the slight changes that had
taken place.&nbsp; One thing, however, she observed; Humfrey did
not stop the horse at the foot of the steep hill where walking
had been a matter of course, when he had been a less solid weight
than now.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, Honor,&rsquo; he said, smiling,
&lsquo;one grows less merciful as one grows old and
short-breathed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You growing old! you whom I&rsquo;ve never left off
thinking of as a promising lad, as poor old Mrs. Mervyn used to
call you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned his face towards her as if about to say something
very seriously, but apparently changing his intention, he said,
&lsquo;Poor old Mrs. Mervyn, I wonder how she would like the
changes at Beauchamp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are the Fulmorts doing a great deal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have quite modernized the house, and laid out the
garden&mdash;what I should call very prettily, if it were not for
my love of the old Dutch one.&nbsp; They see a great deal of
company, and go on in grand style.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you get on with them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! very well; I have dined there two or three
times.&nbsp; He is a good-natured fellow enough, and there are
some nice children, whom I like to meet with their nurses in the
woods.&nbsp; I stood proxy for the last one&rsquo;s sponsor; I
could not undertake the office myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-natured!&rsquo; exclaimed Nora.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
you know how he behaved at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; No more
than &pound;5 a year would he ever give to any charity, though he
was making thousands by those gin-shops.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Probably he thought he was doing very
liberally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, there is no hope for St. Wulstan&rsquo;s till
people have left off thinking a guinea their duty, and five very
handsome! and that Augusta Mervyn should have gone and married
our <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>&mdash;our lord of gin-palaces&mdash;I
do think it must be on purpose for you to melt him.&nbsp; I shall
set you at him, Humfrey, next time Mr. Askew writes to me in
despair, that something won&rsquo;t go on for lack of
means.&nbsp; Only I must be quite sure that you won&rsquo;t give
the money yourself, to spare the trouble of dunning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not fair to take other people&rsquo;s duties on
oneself; besides, as you&rsquo;ll find, Honor, the Holt purse is
not bottomless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she would find!&nbsp; This was a very odd way of making
sure <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>of her beforehand, but she was not certain that she did
not like it.&nbsp; It was comfortable, and would save much
preliminary.</p>
<p>The woods were bursting into spring: delicate, deeply creased
leaves were joyously emerging to the light on the birches, not
yet devoid of the silvery wool where they had been packed, the
hazels were fluttering their goslings, the palms were honey sweet
with yellow tufts, the primroses peeped out in the banks of
moss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Humfrey, this is the great desire of my life
fulfilled, to see the Holt in the flush of spring!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have always said you cared for the place more than
any one,&rsquo; said Humfrey, evidently gratified, but with an
expression which she did not understand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if I did not!&nbsp; But how strangely differently
from my vision my wish has been fulfilled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strangely!&rsquo; he repeated, with even greater
seriousness than had been in her voice.</p>
<p>The meadow was bright with spring grass, the cattle grazing
serenely as in old times, the garden&mdash;ah! not quite so
gay&mdash;either it was better in autumn than in spring, or it
wanted poor Sarah&rsquo;s hand; the dogs, not the same
individuals, but with much the same manners, dancing round their
master&mdash;all like, all home.&nbsp; Nothing wanting, but,
alas! the good-natured, narrow-minded old mistress of the house
to fret her, and notable Sarah to make her comfortable, and
wonder at her eccentric tastes.&nbsp; Ah! and how much more was
wanting the gentle mother who did all the civility and listening,
and the father, so happy to look at green woods, read poetry, and
unbend his weary brow!&nbsp; How much more precious was the sight
of the one living remnant of those days!</p>
<p>They had a cheerful evening.&nbsp; Mr. Saville had a great
deal of old-fashioned Oxford agreeableness; he was very courtly,
but a sensible man, with some native fun and many college
stories.&nbsp; After many years of donship, his remote parish was
somewhat of a solitude to him, and intercourse with a cultivated
mind was as pleasant to him now as the sight of a lady had been
in his college days.&nbsp; Honor liked conversation too; and Miss
Wells, Lucilla, and Owen had been rather barren in that respect,
so there was a great deal of liveliness, in which Humfrey took
his full share; while good Mrs. Saville looked like what she was,
her husband&rsquo;s admiring housekeeper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you take early walks still, Humfrey?&rsquo; asked
Honor, as she bade him good night.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you do, I
shall be quite ready to confront the dew;&rsquo; and therewith
came a revulsion of the consciousness within.&nbsp; Was this
courting him? and to her great provocation there arose an
uncomfortable blush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said, with something of a mournful
tone, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m past that, Honor.&nbsp;
To-morrow, after breakfast&mdash;good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor was a little alarmed by all this, and designed a
conference with the old housekeeper, Mrs. Stubbs, to inquire into
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>her master&rsquo;s health, but this was not attainable
that night, and she could only go to bed in the friendly old
wainscoted room, whose white and gold carved monsters on the
mantelpiece were well-nigh as familiar as the dove in
Woolstone-lane; but, oh! how it made her long for the mother whom
she used to kiss there.</p>
<p>Humfrey was brisk and cheerful as ever at breakfast, devising
what his guests would like to do for the day, and talking of some
friends whom he had asked to meet Mr. Saville, so that all the
anxieties with which Honora had risen were dissipated, and she
took her part gaily in the talk.&nbsp; There was something
therefore freshly startling to her, when, on rising, Humfrey
gravely said, &lsquo;Honor, will you come into my study for a
little while?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The study had always been more of a place for guns and
fishing-tackle than for books.&nbsp; It was Humfrey&rsquo;s usual
living room when alone, and was of course full besides of justice
books, agricultural reports, acts of parliament, piles of papers,
little bags of samples of wheat, all in the orderly disorder
congenial to the male kind.&nbsp; All this was as usual, but the
change that struck her was, that the large red leather lounging
chair, hitherto a receptacle for the overflowings of the table,
was now wheeled beside the fire, and near it stood a little table
with a large print Bible on it, which she well remembered as his
mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Humfrey set a chair for her by the fire,
and seated himself in the easy one, leaning back a little.&nbsp;
She had not spoken.&nbsp; Something in his grave preparation
somewhat awed her, and she sat upright, watching him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very kind of you to come, Honor,&rsquo; he
began; &lsquo;more kind than you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it could be no other than a
treat&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He continued, before she could go farther, &lsquo;I wished
particularly to speak to you.&nbsp; I thought it might perhaps
spare you a shock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with a terrified eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, my dear,&rsquo; he said,
leaning forward, &lsquo;there is no occasion.&nbsp; Such things
must come sooner or later, and it is only that I wished to tell
you that I have been having advice for a good many uncomfortable
feelings that have troubled me lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she asked, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Dixon tells me that it is aneurism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quick and fast came Honora&rsquo;s breath; her hands were
clasped together; her eyes cast about with such a piteous,
despairing expression, that he started to his feet in a moment,
exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Honor!&nbsp; Honor dear! don&rsquo;t!
there&rsquo;s no need.&nbsp; I did not think you would feel it in
this way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feel! what should I feel if not for you?&nbsp; Oh!
Humfrey! don&rsquo;t say it! you are all that is left
me&mdash;you cannot be spared!&rsquo; and as he came towards her,
she grasped his hand and clung to him, needing the support which
he gave in fear of her fainting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Honor, do not take it thus.&nbsp; I am very well
now&mdash;I <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>dare say I shall be so to the last,
and there is nothing terrible to the imagination.&nbsp; I am very
thankful for both the preparation and the absence of
suffering.&nbsp; Will not you be the same?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you,&rsquo; said Honora, sitting up again, and
looking up into his sincere, serene face; &lsquo;I cannot doubt
that even this is well for you, but it is all
selfishness&mdash;just as I was beginning to feel what you are to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Humfrey&rsquo;s face lighted up suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,
Honor,&rsquo; he said, evidently putting strong restraint upon
his voice, &lsquo;you could have listened to me now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head&mdash;the tears were dropping very
fast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; he said, as again he leant back in
his chair; and when she raised her eyes again, he sat with his
hands clasped, and a look of heavenly felicity on his face,
raised upwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Humfrey! how thoughtlessly I have trifled away all
that might have been the happiness of your life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never trifled with me,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you
have always dealt honestly and straightforwardly, and it is best
as it is.&nbsp; Had we been together all this time, the parting
might have been much harder.&nbsp; I am glad there are so few
near ties to break.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say so! you, loved by every one, the tower
of strength to all that is good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush! nonsense, Honor!&rsquo; said he,
kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I have tried,&rsquo; he went on,
gravely, &lsquo;not to fall behind the duties of my station; but
that would be a bad dependence, were there not something else to
look to.&nbsp; As to missing me, the world did very well without
me before I was born; it will do as well when I am gone; and as
to you, my poor Honor, we have been very little together of
late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had you to lean on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lean on something stronger,&rsquo; he said; and as she
could not govern her bitter weeping, he went on&mdash;&lsquo;Ah!
I am the selfish one now, to be glad of what must make it the
worse for you; but if one thing were wanting to make me happy, it
was to know that at last you cared for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be a wretch not to do so.&nbsp; So many years
of patience and forbearance!&mdash;Nobody could be like
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that,&rsquo; said Humfrey,
simply.&nbsp; &lsquo;While you continued the same, I could not
well turn my mind to any one else, and I always knew I was much
too loutish for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Humfrey!&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is no use in dwelling on this,&rsquo; he
said, quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The reason I asked you to be kind
enough to come here, is that I do not think it well to be far
from home under the circumstances.&nbsp; There, don&rsquo;t look
frightened&mdash;they say it may very possibly not come for
several months or a year.&nbsp; I hope to have time to put things
a little in order for you, and that is one reason I wished to see
you; I thought I could make the beginning easier to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>But Honora was far too much shaken for such a turn to
the conversation; she would not mortify him, but she could
neither listen nor understand.&nbsp; He, who was so full of
stalwart force, a doomed man, yet calm and happy under his
sentence; he, only discovered to be so fondly loved in time to
give poignancy to the parting, and yet rejoicing himself in the
poor, tardy affection that had answered his manly constancy too
late!&nbsp; His very calmness and stillness cut her to the heart,
and after some ineffectual attempts to recover herself, she was
forced to take refuge in her own room.&nbsp; Weeping, praying,
walking restlessly about, she remained there till luncheon time,
when Humfrey himself came up to knock at her door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor dear!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;come down&mdash;try
to throw it off&mdash;Saville does not wish his wife to be made
aware of it while she is here, lest she should be nervous.&nbsp;
You must not betray me&mdash;and indeed there is no reason for
being overcome.&nbsp; Nothing vexes me but seeing you so.&nbsp;
Let us enjoy your visit, pray.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To be commanded to bear up by a strong, manly character so
much loved and trusted was perhaps the chief support she could
receive; she felt that she must act composure, and coming down in
obedience to her cousin, she found the power of doing so.&nbsp;
Nay, as she saw him so completely the bright, hospitable host,
talking to Mrs. Saville about her poultry, and carrying on quiet
jokes with Mr. Saville, she found herself drawn away from the
morning&rsquo;s conversation, or remembering it like a dream that
had passed away.</p>
<p>Then all went out together, and he was apparently as much
interested in his young wheat as ever, and even more anxious to
make her look at and appreciate crops and cattle, speaking about
them in his hearty, simple way, as if his pleasure in them was
not flagging, perhaps because it had never been excessive.&nbsp;
He had always sat loose to them, and thus they could please and
occupy him even when the touch of the iron hand had made itself
felt.</p>
<p>And again she saw him engrossed in arranging some petty matter
of business for one of the poor people; and when they had
wandered down to the gate, pelting the turn-out of the
boys&rsquo; school with a pocket full of apples that he said he
had taken up while in conference with the housekeeper, laughing
and speaking merrily as the varlets touched their caps to him,
and always turning to her for sympathy in his pleasures of
success or of good nature, as though her visit were thorough
enjoyment to him.&nbsp; And so it almost was to her.&nbsp; The
influence of the dear old scenes was something, and his
cheeriness was a great deal more; the peaceful present was not
harassed or disturbed, and the foreboding, on which she might not
dwell, made it the more precious.&nbsp; That slow wandering about
the farm and village, and the desultory remarks, the old pleasant
reminiscences, the inquiries and replies about the villagers and
neighbours had a <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>quiet charm about them, as free and
happy as when, youth and child, they had frisked through the same
paths; nay, the old scenes so brought back the old habits that
she found herself discoursing to him in her former eager fashion
upon the last historical character who had bitten her fancy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My old way,&rsquo; she said, catching herself up;
&lsquo;dinning all this into your ears as usual, when you
don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; said Humfrey, with his sincere
face turned on her in all its sweetness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I
never showed you how much, Honor; and I beg your pardon, but I
would not have been without it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Savilles came up, while Honor&rsquo;s heart was brimful at
this compliment, and then it was all commonplace again, except
for that sunset light, that rich radiance of the declining day,
that seemed unconsciously to pervade all Humfrey&rsquo;s
cheerfulness, and to give his mirth and playfulness a solid
happiness.</p>
<p>Some mutual friends of long standing came to dinner, and the
evening was not unlike the last, quite as free from gloom, and
Mr. Charlecote as bright as ever, evidently taking his full share
in county business, and giving his mind to it.&nbsp; Only Honor
noted that he quietly avoided an invitation to a very gay party
which was proposed; and his great ally, Sir John Raymond, seemed
rather vexed with him for not taking part in some new and
expensive experiment in farming, and asked incredulously whether
it were true that he wished to let a farm that he had kept for
several years in his own hands.&nbsp; Humfrey agreed that it was
so, and said something farther of wishing to come to terms
quickly.&nbsp; She guessed that this was for her sake, when she
thought all this over in her bedroom.</p>
<p>Such was the effect of his calmness that it had not been a day
of agitation.&nbsp; There was more peace than tumult in her mind
as she lay down to rest, sad, but not analyzing her sadness, and
lulled by the present into putting aside the future.&nbsp; So she
slept quietly, and awoke with a weight at her heart, but softened
and sustained by reverent awe and obedience towards her
cousin.</p>
<p>When they met, he scanned her looks with a bright, tender
glance, and smiled commendation when he detected no air of
sleeplessness.&nbsp; He talked and moved as though his secret
were one of untold bliss, and this was not far from the truth;
for when, after breakfast, he asked her for another interview in
the study, they were no sooner alone than he rubbed his hands
together with satisfaction, saying&mdash;&lsquo;So, Honor, you
could have had me after all!&rsquo; looking at her with a broad,
undisguised, exulting smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Humfrey!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say it if you don&rsquo;t like it; but you
can&rsquo;t guess the pleasure it gives me.&nbsp; I could hardly
tell at first what was making me so happy when I awoke this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see how it should,&rsquo; said Honor, her
eyes swimming with tears, &lsquo;never to have met with any
gratitude for&mdash;I have <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>used you too
ill&mdash;never valued, scarcely even believed in what you
lavished on poor silly me&mdash;and now, when all is too late,
you are glad&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glad! of course I am,&rsquo; returned Humfrey; &lsquo;I
never wished to obtrude my feelings on you after I knew how it
stood with you.&nbsp; It would have been a shame.&nbsp; Your
choice went far above me.&nbsp; For the rest, if to find you
disposed towards me at the last makes me so happy,&rsquo; and he
looked at her again with beaming affection, &lsquo;how could I
have borne to leave you if all had been as I wished?&nbsp; No,
no, it is best as it is.&nbsp; You lose nothing in position, and
you are free to begin the world again, not knocked down or
crushed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, Humfrey!&nbsp; It is breaking my
heart to think that I might have been making you happy all this
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven did not will it so,&rsquo; said Humfrey,
reverently, &lsquo;and it might not have proved what we
fancy.&nbsp; You might not have found such a clodhopper all you
wanted, and my stupidity might have vexed you, though now you
fancy otherwise.&nbsp; And I have had a very happy
life&mdash;indeed I have, Honor; I never knew the time when I
could not say with all my heart, &ldquo;The lot is fallen unto me
in a fair ground, yea, I have a goodly heritage.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Everybody and everything, you and all the rest, have been very
kind and friendly, and I have never wanted for happiness.&nbsp;
It has been all right.&nbsp; You could fulfil your duty as a
daughter undividedly, and now I trust those children will be your
object and comfort&mdash;only, Honor, not your idols.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was jealousy, but I have sometimes fancied that your
tendency with their father&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! how often I must have given you pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not mean <i>that</i>, but, as I say, perhaps I
was no fair judge.&nbsp; One thing is well, the relations will be
much less likely to take them from you when you are living
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She held up her hands in deprecation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor dear,&rsquo; he said pleadingly, yet with
authority, &lsquo;pray let me talk to you.&nbsp; There are things
which I wish very much to say; indeed, without which I could
hardly have asked for this indulgence.&nbsp; It is for your own
sake, and that of the place and people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor place, poor people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, but then turned his smiling countenance towards her
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one else can care for it or them as you
do, Honor.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;goodly heritage&rdquo;&mdash;it was
so when I had it from my father, and I don&rsquo;t think it has
got worse under my charge, and I want you to do your duty by it,
Honor, and hand it on the same, whoever may come
after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For your sake, Humfrey&mdash;even if I did not love
it.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is a duty,&rsquo; proceeded Humfrey,
gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may seem but a bit of earth after all,
but the owner of a property has a duty to let it do its share in
producing food, or maybe in not lessening the number of pleasant
things here below.&nbsp; I mean <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>it is as much
my office to keep my trees and woods fair to look at, as it is
not to let my land lie waste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had recovered a good deal while he was moralizing, and
became interested.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not suspect you of the
poetical view, Humfrey,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is plain sense, I think,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that
to grub up a fine tree, or a pretty bit of copse without fair
reason, only out of eagerness for gain, is a bit of
selfishness.&nbsp; But mind, Honor, you must not go and be
romantic.&nbsp; You <i>must</i> have the timber marked when the
trees are injuring each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ve often done it with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would come out with me to-day.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to the out-wood, I could show you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She agreed readily, almost forgetting the wherefore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And above all, Honor, you must not be romantic about
wages!&nbsp; It is not right by other proprietors, nor by the
people themselves.&nbsp; No one is ever the better for a fancy
price for his labour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could almost have smiled; he was at once so well pleased
that she and his &lsquo;goodly heritage&rsquo; should belong to
each other, so confident in her love and good intentions towards
it, and so doubtful of her discretion and management.&nbsp; She
promised with all her heart to do her utmost to fulfil his
wishes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; he said, thoughtfully, &lsquo;the
best thing for the place&mdash;ay, and for you and every one,
would be for you to marry; but there&rsquo;s little chance of
that, I suppose, and it is of no use to distress you by
mentioning it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been trying to put out of my
hands things that I don&rsquo;t think you will be able to manage,
but I should like you to keep up the home farm, and you may
pretty well trust to Brooks.&nbsp; I dare say he will take his
own way, but if you keep a reasonable check on him, he will do
very well by you.&nbsp; He is as honest as the day, and very
intelligent.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know that any one could do
better for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes; I will mind all he tells me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t show that you mind him.&nbsp; That is the
way to spoil him.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he has been a good servant
to me, and so have they all.&nbsp; It is a thing to be very
thankful for to have had such a set of good servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora thought, but did not say, that they could not help
being good with such a master.</p>
<p>He went on to tell her that he had made Mr. Saville his
executor.&nbsp; Mr. Saville had been for many years before
leaving Oxford bursar of his college, and was a thorough man of
business whom Humfrey had fixed upon as the person best qualified
to be an adviser and assistant to Honora, and he only wished to
know whether she wished for any other selection, but this was
nearly overpowering her again, for since her father&rsquo;s death
she had leant on no one but Humfrey himself.</p>
<p>One thing more he had to say.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know, Honor,
this place will be entirely your own.&nbsp; You and I seem to be
the <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>last of the Charlecotes, and even if we were not, there
is no entail.&nbsp; You may found orphan asylums with it, or
leave it to poor Sandbrook&rsquo;s children, just as you
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I could not do that,&rsquo; cried Honor, with a
sudden revulsion.&nbsp; Love them as she might, Owen
Sandbrook&rsquo;s children must not step into Humfrey
Charlecote&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, besides,&rsquo; she
added, &lsquo;I want my little Owen to be a clergyman; I think he
can be what his father missed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you can do exactly as you think fit.&nbsp; Only
what I wanted to tell you is, that there may be another branch,
elder than our own.&nbsp; Not that this need make the least
difference, for the Holt is legally ours.&nbsp; It seems that our
great grandfather had an elder son&mdash;a wild sort of
fellow&mdash;the old people used to tell stories of him.&nbsp; He
went on, in short, till he was disinherited, and went off to
America.&nbsp; What became of him afterwards I never could make
out; but I have sometimes questioned how I should receive any of
his heirs if they should turn up some day.&nbsp; Mind you, you
need not have the slightest scruple in holding your own.&nbsp; It
was made over to my grandfather by will, as I have made it sure
for you; but I do think that when you come to think how to
dispose of it, the possibility of the existence of these
Charlecotes might be taken into consideration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yankee Charlecotes!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind; most likely nothing of the kind will ever
come in your way, and they have not the slightest claim on
you.&nbsp; I only threw it out, because I thought it right just
to speak of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this commencement, Humfrey, on this and the ensuing
days, made it his business to make his cousin acquainted with the
details of the management of the estate.&nbsp; He took such
pleasure in doing so, and was so anxious she should comprehend,
that she was forced to give her whole attention; and, putting all
else aside, was tranquilly happy in thus gratifying him.&nbsp;
Those orderly ranges of conscientious accounts were no small
testimony to the steady, earnest manner in which Humfrey had set
himself to his duty from his early youth, and to a degree they
were his honest pride too&mdash;he liked to show how good years
had made up for bad years, and there was a tenderness in the way
he patted their red leather backs to make them even on their
shelves, as if they had been good friends to him.&nbsp; No, they
must not run into confusion.</p>
<p>The farms and the cottages&mdash;the friendly terms of his
intercourse, and his large-handed but well-judging
almsgiving&mdash;all revealed to her more of his solid worth; and
the simplicity that regarded all as the merest duty touched her
more than all.&nbsp; Many a time did she think of the royal
Norwegian brothers, one of whom went to tie a knot in the willows
on the banks of the Jordan, while the other remained at home to
be the blessing of his people, and from her broken idol wanderer
she turned to worship her steadfast worker at home, as far as his
humility and <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>homeliness made it possible, and
valued each hour with him as if each moment were of diamond
price.&nbsp; And he was so calmly happy, that there was no
grieving in his presence.&nbsp; It had been a serene life of
simple fulfilment of duty, going ever higher, and branching
wider, as a good man&rsquo;s standard gradually rises the longer
he lives; the one great disappointment had been borne without
sourness or repining, and the affections, deprived of the home
channel, had spread in a beneficent flood, and blessed all
around.&nbsp; So, though, like every sinful son of man, sensible
of many an error, many an infirmity, still the open loving spirit
was childlike enough for that blessed sense; for that feeling
which St. John expresses as &lsquo;if our heart condemn us not,
then have we confidence towards God;&rsquo; confidence in the
infinite Merits that atone for the errors of weakness, and
occasional wanderings of will; confidence that made the hope a
sure and steadfast one, and these sentenced weeks a land of
Beulah, where Honora&rsquo;s tardy response to his constant love
could be greeted and valued as the precious fulfilment of
long-cherished wishes, not dashed aside as giving bitterness to
his departure.</p>
<p>The parting was broken by a promise that Honora should again
meet the Savilles at the Holt in the autumn.&nbsp; She assured
herself that there was no danger before that time, and Humfrey
spoke cheerfully of looking forward to it, and seemed to have so
much to do, and to be so well equal to doing it, that he would
not let them be concerned at leaving him alone.</p>
<p>To worship Humfrey was an easier thing at a distance than when
beside him.&nbsp; Honora came back to Sandbeach thoroughly
restless and wretched, reproaching herself with having wasted
such constant, priceless affection, haunted by the constant dread
of each morning&rsquo;s post, and longing fervently to be on the
spot.&nbsp; She had self-command enough not to visit her
dejection on the children, but they missed both her spirits and
her vigilance, and were more left to their nurse; and her chief
solace was in long solitary walks, or in evening talks with Miss
Wells.&nbsp; Kind Miss Wells perhaps guessed how matters stood
between the two last Charlecotes, but she hinted not her
suspicions, and was the unwearied recipient of all Honora&rsquo;s
histories, of his symptoms, of his cheerfulness, and his
solicitude for her.&nbsp; Those talks did her good, they set the
real Humfrey before her, and braced her to strive against
weakness and despondence.</p>
<p>And then the thought grew on her, why, since they were so
thoroughly each other&rsquo;s, why should they not marry, and be
together to the last?&nbsp; Why should he be left to his solitude
for this final year? why should their meetings be so prudentially
chaperoned?&nbsp; Suppose the disease should be lingering, how
hard it was that she should be absent, and he left to
servants!&nbsp; She could well imagine why he had not proposed
it; he was too unselfish to think of exposing her to the shock,
or making her a widow, but how came she never to have thought of
it?&nbsp; She stood beyond all ordinary rules&mdash;she had
nothing <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>worldly to gain nor to lose by being
his wife for these few remaining months&mdash;it surely was her
part, after the way she had treated him, to meet him more than
half way&mdash;she alone could make the proposal&mdash;she
would&mdash;she must.&nbsp; And oh! if the doctors should be
mistaken!&nbsp; So spoke the midnight dream&mdash;oh! how many
times.&nbsp; But what said cool morning?&nbsp; Propriety had
risen up, grave decorum objecting to what would shock Humfrey,
ay, and was making Honor&rsquo;s cheeks tingle.&nbsp; Yes, and
there came the question whether he would not be more distressed
than gratified&mdash;he who wished to detach himself from all
earthly ties&mdash;whether he might not be pained and displeased
at her thus clinging to him&mdash;nay, were he even gratified,
might not emotion and agitation be fatal?</p>
<p>Many, many times was all this tossed over in Honor&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; Often the desperate resolution was definitely taken,
and she had seen herself quietly meeting him at dear old
Hiltonbury Church, with his grave sweet eyes resting satisfied
upon her as his darling.&nbsp; As often had the fear of offending
him, and the instinct of woman&rsquo;s dignity turned her away
when her heart was beating high.&nbsp; That autumn
visit&mdash;then she would decide.&nbsp; One look as if he wished
to retain her, the least air of feebleness or depression, and she
would be determined, even if she had to waive all feminine
reserves, and set the matter in hand herself.&nbsp; She thought
Mr. Saville would highly approve and assist; and having settled
into this period for her project, she set herself in some degree
at rest, and moved and spoke with so much more of her natural
ease, that Miss Wells was consoled about her, and knew not how
entirely heart and soul were at Hiltonbury, with such devotion as
had never even gone to the backwoods.</p>
<p>To meet the Savilles at Hiltonbury in the autumn!&nbsp;
Yes&mdash;Honor met Mr. Saville, but not as she had
intended.&nbsp; By that time the stroke had fallen, just as she
had become habituated to the expectation, just as her promised
visit had assumed a degree of proximity, and her heart was
beating at the prospect of the results.</p>
<p>Humfrey had been scarcely ailing all the summer, he had gone
about his occupations with his usual cheerfulness, and had taken
part in all the village festivals as genially as ever.&nbsp; Only
close observers could have noticed a slackness towards new
undertakings, a gradual putting off of old ones, a training of
those, dependent on his counsel, to go alone, a preference for
being alone in the evening, a greater habit of stillness and
contemplation.</p>
<p>September had come, and he had merrily sent off two happy
boy-sportsmen with the keeper, seeing them over the first field
himself, and leaning against the gate, as he sent them away in
convulsions of laughing at his droll auguries.&nbsp; The second
was a Sunday, a lovely day of clear deep blue sky, and rich
sunshine laughing upon the full wealth of harvest
fields&mdash;part fallen before the hand of the reaper, part
waving in their ripe glowing <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>beauty, to
which he loved to liken Honora&rsquo;s hair&mdash;part in noble
redundant shocks of corn in full season.&nbsp; Brooks used
afterwards to tell how he overtook the squire slowly strolling to
church on that beauteous autumnal morning, and how he paused to
remark on the glory of the harvest, and to add, &lsquo;Keep the
big barn clear, Brooks&mdash;let us have all the women and
children in for the supper this time&mdash;and I say&mdash;send
the spotted heifer down to-morrow to old Boycotts, instead of his
cow that died.&nbsp; With such a crop as this, one can stand
something.&nbsp; And,&rsquo; said Brooks, &lsquo;Thank God for
it! was as plain written on his face as ever I saw!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the first Sunday in the month, and there was full
service.&nbsp; Hiltonbury Church had one of those old-fashioned
altar-rails which form three sides of a square, and where it was
the custom that at the words &lsquo;Draw near with faith,&rsquo;
the earliest communicants should advance to the rail and remain
till their place was wanted by others, and that the last should
not return to their seats till the service was concluded.&nbsp;
Mr. Charlecote had for many years been always the first
parishioner to walk slowly up the matted aisle, and kneel beside
the wall, under the cumbrous old tables of Commandments.&nbsp;
There, on this day, he knelt as usual, and harvest labours
tending to thin the number of communicants, the same who came up
first remained to the end, joined their voices in the Eucharistic
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and Angelic Hymn, and bowed their heads at
the blessing of the peace that passeth all understanding.</p>
<p>It was not till the rest were moving away, that the vicar and
his clerk remarked that the squire had not risen.&nbsp; Another
look, and it was plain that he had sunk somewhat forward on his
folded arms, and was only supported by the rail and the
wall.&nbsp; The vicar hastily summoned the village doctor, who
had not yet left the church.&nbsp; They lifted him, and laid him
along on the cushioned step where he had been kneeling, but
motion and breath were gone, the strong arms were helpless, and
the colour had left the open face.&nbsp; Taken at once from the
heavenly Feast on earth to the glory above, could this be called
sudden death?</p>
<p>There he lay on the altar step, with hands crossed on his
breast, and perfectly blessed repose on his manly countenance,
sweetened and ennobled in its stillness, and in every lineament
bearing the impress of that Holy Spirit of love who had made it a
meet temple.</p>
<p>What an unpremeditated lying in state was that! as by ones and
twos, beneath the clergyman&rsquo;s eye, the villagers stole in
with slowly, heavily falling tread to gaze in silent awe on their
best friend, some sobbing and weeping beyond control, others with
grave, almost stolid tranquillity, or the murmured &lsquo;He
<i>was</i> a gentleman,&rsquo; which, in a poor man&rsquo;s
mouth, means &lsquo;he was a just man and patient, the friend of
the weak and poor.&rsquo;&nbsp; His farmers and his own labourers
put their shoulders to bear him once more to his own house,
through his half-gathered crops&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>The hand of the reaper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Takes the ears that are hoary,<br />
But the voice of the weeper<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wails manhood in glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, bewail him not.&nbsp; It was glory, indeed, but the glory
of early autumn, the garnering of the shock of corn in full
season.&nbsp; It was well done of the vicar that a few long,
full-grained ears of wheat were all that was laid upon his breast
in his coffin.</p>
<p>There Honora saw them.&nbsp; The vicar, Mr. Henderson, had
written to her at once, as Humfrey had long ago charged him to
do, enclosing a letter that he had left with him for the purpose,
a tender, soothing farewell, and an avowal such as he could never
have spoken of the blessing that his attachment to her had been,
in drawing his mind from the narrowness to which he might have
been liable, and in elevating the tone of his views and
opinions.</p>
<p>She knew what he meant&mdash;it was what he had caught from
her youthful enthusiasm, second-hand from Owen Sandbrook.&nbsp;
Oh! what vivid, vigorous truth not to have been weakened in the
transit through two such natures, but to have done its work in
the strong, practical mind able and candid enough to adopt it
even thus filtered!</p>
<p>There were a few words of affectionate commendation of his
people and his land into her keeping, and a parting blessing,
and, lastly, written as a postscript&mdash;with a blot as if it
had been written with hesitation&mdash;&lsquo;Little children,
keep yourselves from idols!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not bitter weeping.&nbsp; It was rather the sense of
utter vacancy and hopelessness, with but one fixed
purpose&mdash;that she would see his face again, and be the
nearest to him when he was laid in the grave.&nbsp; She hastily
wrote to the housekeeper and to the clergyman that she was
coming, and Miss Wells&rsquo;s kind opposition only gave her just
wilfulness and determination enough to keep her spirit from
sinking.</p>
<p>So she travelled alone, and came to Hiltonbury in the sunset,
as the &lsquo;last long wains&rsquo; were slowly bearing their
loads of wheat into the farmyard, the waggoners walking
dejectedly beside them.&nbsp; Mr. Saville had come before her,
and was at the door to receive her.&nbsp; She could not very well
bear the presence of any one, nor the talk of cold-blooded
arrangements.&nbsp; It seemed to keep away the dreamy living with
Humfrey, and was far more dreary than the feeling of
desolateness, and when they treated her as mistress of the house
that was too intolerable.&nbsp; And yet it was worth something,
too, to be the one to authorize that harvest supper in the big
barn, in the confidence that it would be anything but
revelry.&nbsp; Every one felt that the day was indeed a Harvest
Home.</p>
<p>The funeral, according to his expressed wishes, was like those
of the farmers of the parish; the coffin borne by his own
labourers in their white round frocks; and the labourers were the
expected guests for whom provision was made; but far and <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>wide from all the country round, though harvest was at
the height, came farmers and squires, poor men and rich, from the
peer and county member down to the poor travelling
hawker&mdash;all had met the sunny sympathy of that smile, all
had been aided and befriended, all felt as if a prop, a castle of
strength were gone.</p>
<p>Charlecotes innumerable rested in the chancel, and the last
heir of the line was laid beneath the same flag where he had been
placed on that last Sunday, the spot where Honor might kneel for
many more, meeting him in spirit at the feast, and looking to the
time when the cry should be, &lsquo;Put ye in the sickle, for the
harvest is come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But ere she could look in thorough hope for that time, another
page of Honor&rsquo;s life must be turned, and an alloy, as yet
unknown to herself, must be purged from her heart.&nbsp; The last
gleam of her youthful sunshine had faded with Humfrey; but youth
is but a fraction of human existence, and there were further
phases to be gone through and lessons to be learnt; although she
was feeling as if all were over with her in this world, and
neither hope, love, nor protection were left her, nor any
interest save cherishing Humfrey Charlecote&rsquo;s memory, as
she sat designing the brass tablet which was to record his name
and age in old English illuminated letters, surrounded by a
border of ears of corn and grapes.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<blockquote><p>The glittering grass, with dewstars bright,<br />
Is all astir with twinkling light;<br />
What pity that such fair array<br />
In one brief hour should melt away.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rev. T. Whytehead</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;This is a stroke of good luck!&rsquo; said Mr.
Charteris.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must not, on any account, remove the
Sandbrook children from Miss Charlecote; she has no relations,
and will certainly make the boy her heir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will marry!&rsquo; said his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some
fashionable preacher will swallow her red hair.&nbsp; She is just
at the age for it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Less likely when she has the children to occupy
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have them thrown on your hands
yet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The chance is worth trying for, though!&nbsp; I would
not interfere with her on any account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, nor I! but I pity the children.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, Master Owen, be a good boy, and don&rsquo;t
worry.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see, I&rsquo;m putting up your
things to go home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home!&rsquo; the light glittered in Lucilla&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it Wrapworth, nursey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, miss, not Wrapworth.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s given
away, you know; but it&rsquo;s to Hiltonbury you are
going&mdash;such a grand <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>place, which
if Master Owen is only a dear good boy, will all belong to him
one of these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will there be a pony to ride on?&rsquo; asked Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll only let those stockings
alone&mdash;there&rsquo;ll be ponies, and carriages, and horses,
and everything a gentleman can have, and all for my own dear
little Master Owen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Hiltonbury,&rsquo; said
Lucilla; &lsquo;I want to go home to the river and the boat, and
see Mr. Prendergast and the black cow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a black cow, Cilly,&rsquo; said
Owen, strutting about.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is Hiltonbury bigger than the
castle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, ever so big, Master Owen; such acres of wood, Mr.
Jones says, and all your dear cousin&rsquo;s, and sure to be your
own in time.&nbsp; What a great gentleman you will be, to be
sure, dining thirty gentlefolks twice a week, as they say poor
Mr. Charlecote did, and driving four fine horses to your carriage
like a gentleman.&nbsp; And then you won&rsquo;t forget poor old
nursey-pursey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, nurse; I&rsquo;ll give you a ride in my
carriage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora in her listless state had let Mr. Saville think for
her, and passively obeyed him when he sent her back to Sandbeach
to wind up her affairs there, while he finished off the
valuations and other painful business at the Holt, in which she
could be of little use, since all she desired was to keep
everything as it was.&nbsp; She was anxious to return as soon as
possible, so as to take up the reins before there had been time
for the relaxation to be felt, the only chance she felt of her
being able to fulfil his charge.&nbsp; The removal, the bustle,
the talking things over with Miss Wells, and the sight of the
children did much to restore her, and her old friend rejoiced to
see that necessary occupation was tending to make her time pass
more cheerfully than she perhaps knew.</p>
<p>As to the dear old City dwelling, it might have fetched an
immense price, but only to become a warehouse, a measure that
would have seemed to Honor little short of sacrilege.&nbsp; To
let it, in such a locality, was impossible, so it must remain
unavailable capital, and Honora decided on leaving her old
housekeeper therein, with a respectable married niece, who would
inhabit the lower regions, and keep the other rooms in order, for
an occasional stay in London.&nbsp; She would have been sorry to
cut herself off from a month of London in the spring, and the
house might farther be useful to friends who did not object to
the situation; or could be lent now and then to a curate; and she
could well afford to keep it up, so she thought herself justified
in following her inclination, and went up for three mournful days
of settling matters there, and packing books and ornaments till
the rooms looked so dismantled that she could not think how to
face them again.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of October when she met Miss Wells,
children, and luggage at the station, and fairly was on her
way<!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span> to her home.&nbsp; She tried to call it so, as a duty
to Humfrey, but it gave her a pang every time, and in effect she
felt far less at home than when he and Sarah had stood in the
doorway to greet the arrivals.&nbsp; She had purposely fixed an
hour when it would be dark, so that she might receive no painful
welcome; she wished no one to greet her, she had rather they were
mourning for their master.&nbsp; She had more than once shocked
Miss Wells by declaring heiresses to be a mistake; and yet, as
she always owned, she could not have borne for any one else to
have had the Holt.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, the children were sleepy, and were rather
in a mazy state when lifted out and set on their legs in the
wainscoted hall, and she sent them at once with nurse to the
cheerful room that Humfrey&rsquo;s little visitors had saved from
becoming disused.&nbsp; Miss Wells&rsquo;s fond vigilance was a
little oppressive, but she gently freed herself from it, and
opened the study door.&nbsp; She had begged that as little change
as possible might be made; and there stood, as she had last seen
them, the large leathern chair, the little table, the big Bible,
and in it the little faded marker she had herself constructed for
his twenty-first birthday, when her powers of making presents had
not equalled her will.&nbsp; Yet what costly gift could have
fulfilled its mission like that one?&nbsp; She opened the heavy
book at the place.&nbsp; It was at the first lesson for the last
day of his life, the end of the prophet Hosea, and the first
words her eyes fell upon were the glorious
prophecy&mdash;&lsquo;I will redeem them from death, I will
ransom them from the power of the grave.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her heart
beat high, and she stood half musing, half reading: &lsquo;They
that dwell under His shadow shall return; they shall revive as
the corn, and grow as the vine.&rsquo;&nbsp; How gentle and
refreshing the cadence!&nbsp; A longing rose up in her to apply
those latter words more closely, by placing them on his tablet;
she did not think they would shock his humility, a consideration
which had withheld her from choosing other passages of which she
always thought in connection with him.&nbsp; Another verse, and
she read: &lsquo;Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more
with idols?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It brought back the postscript.&nbsp; Kind Humfrey must have
seen strong cause before he gave any reproof, least of all to
her, and she could take his word that the fault had been
there.&nbsp; She felt certain of it when she thought of her early
devotion to Owen Sandbrook, and the utter blank caused by his
defection.&nbsp; Nay, she believed she had begun to idolize
Humfrey himself, but now, at her age, chastened, desponding, with
nothing before her save the lonely life of an heiress old maid,
counting no tie of blood with any being, what had she to engross
her affections from the true Object?&nbsp; Alas! Honora&rsquo;s
heart was not feeling that Object sufficient!&nbsp;
Conscientious, earnest, truly loving goodness, and all connected
with it; striving as a faithful, dutiful woman to walk rightly,
still the personal love and trust were not yet come.&nbsp; Spent
as they had been upon props of earth, <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>when these
were taken away the tendrils hung down drearily, unemployed, not
fastening on the true support.</p>
<p>Not that she did not kneel beside that little table, as in a
shrine, and entreat earnestly for strength and judgment to do her
duty faithfully in her new station, so that Humfrey&rsquo;s
charge might be fulfilled, and his people might not suffer; and
this done, and her homage paid to his empty throne, she was
better able to satisfy her motherly friend by her deportment for
the remainder of the evening, and to reply to the welcome of the
weeping Mrs. Stubbs.&nbsp; By one of Humfrey&rsquo;s wise acts of
foresight, his faithful servant, Reeves, had been provided for as
the master of the Union, whither it was certain he would carry
the same milk of human kindness as had been so plentiful at
Hiltonbury, and the Holt was thus left free for Honora&rsquo;s
Mr. Jones, without fear of clashing, though he was divided
between pride in his young lady&rsquo;s ownership of a
&lsquo;landed estate,&rsquo; and his own dislike to a country
residence.</p>
<p>Honora did not sleep soundly.&nbsp; The place was too new, and
yet too familiar, and the rattling of the windows, the roaring of
the wind in the chimney, and the creaking of the vane, without
absolutely wakening her, kept her hearing alive continually,
weaving the noises into some harassing dream that Humfrey&rsquo;s
voice was calling to her, and hindrances always keeping her from
him; and then of Lucilla and Owen in some imminent peril, whence
she shrieked to him to save them, and then remembered he would
stretch out his hand no more.</p>
<p>Sounder sleep came at last, towards morning, and far later
than her usual hour she was wakened by a drumming upon her door,
and the boy and girl dashed in, radiant with excitement at the
novelty of the place.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sweet Honey!&nbsp; Sweet Honey
dear, do get up and see.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a rocking-horse at
the end of the passage.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s a
real pony out in the field.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There are
cows.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a goat and a little kid,
and I want to play with it, and I may, for it is all mine and
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All yours!&nbsp; Owen, boy,&rsquo; repeated Honora,
sitting up in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nursey said it was all to be Owen&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said
Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she said I should be as grand a gentleman as poor
Mr. Charlecote or Uncle Charteris,&rsquo; proceeded Owen,
&lsquo;and that I should go out hunting in a red coat, on a
beautiful horse; but I want to have the kid now, please, Sweet
Honey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nurse does not know anything about it,&rsquo; said
Honora, much annoyed that such an idea should have been suggested
in such a manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought my little Owen wished
for better things&mdash;I thought he was to be like his papa, and
try to be a good shepherd, praising God and helping people to do
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But can&rsquo;t I wear a red coat too?&rsquo; said
Owen, wistfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear; clergymen don&rsquo;t go out hunting; or
how could they teach the poor little children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t be a clergyman.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>This was an inconvenient and most undesirable turn; but
Honor&rsquo;s first object must be to put the right of heirship
out of the little head, and she at once began&mdash;&lsquo;Nurse
must have made a mistake, my dear; this place is your home, and
will be always so, I hope, while it is mine, but it must not be
your own, and you must not think it will.&nbsp; My little boy
must work for himself and other people, and that&rsquo;s better
than having houses and lands given to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those words touched the pride in Lucilla&rsquo;s composition,
and she exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll work too;&rsquo; but
the self-consequence of proprietorship had affected her brother
more strongly, and he repeated, meditatively, &lsquo;Jones said,
not mine while she was alive.&nbsp; Jones was cross.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There might not be much in the words, child as he was, but
there was something in his manner of eyeing her which gave her
acute unbearable pain&mdash;a look as if she stood in his way and
crossed his importance.&nbsp; It was but a baby fit of temper,
but she was in no frame to regard it calmly, and with an
alteration of countenance that went to his heart, she
exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Can that be my little Owen, talking as if
he wanted his Cousin Honor dead and out of the way?&nbsp; We had
better never have come here if you are to leave off loving
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quick to be infected by emotion, the child&rsquo;s arms were
at once round her neck, and he was sobbing out that he loved his
Sweet Honey better than anything; nurse was naughty; Jones was
naughty; he wouldn&rsquo;t hunt, he wouldn&rsquo;t wear a red
coat, he would teach little children just like lambs, he would be
like dear papa; anything the poor little fellow could think of he
poured out with kisses and entreaties to know if he were naughty
still; while his sister, after her usual fashion on such
occasions, began to race up and down the room with paroxysms,
sometimes of stamping, sometimes of something like laughter.</p>
<p>Some minutes passed before Honora could compose herself, or
soothe the boy, by her assurances that he was not to blame, only
those who put things in his head that he could not understand;
and it was not till after much tender fondling that she had
calmed him enough for his morning devotions.&nbsp; No sooner were
these over than he looked up and said, while the tears still
glazed his cheeks, &lsquo;Sweet Honey, I&rsquo;ll tell nurse and
Mr. Jones that I&rsquo;m on pilgrimage to the Eastern land, and
I&rsquo;ll not turn into by-ways after red coats and little kids
to vex you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether Owen quite separated fact from allegory might have
been doubtful to a more prosaic mind than Honora&rsquo;s, but he
had brought this dreamy strain with him from his father, and she
thought it one of his great charms.&nbsp; She had been obliged to
leave him to himself much more than usual of late, and she
fervently resolved to devote herself with double energy to
watching over him, and eradicating any weeds that might have been
sown during her temporary inattention.&nbsp; He clung so fast to
her hand, and was so much delighted to have her with him <!--
page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>again, so often repeating that she must not go away
again, that the genuineness of his affection could not be
doubted, and probably he would only retain an impression of
having been led to say something very shocking, and the alarm to
his sensitive conscience would hinder him from ever even trying
to remember what it was.</p>
<p>She spoke, however, to nurse, telling her that the subject
must never be mentioned to the children, since it was by no means
desirable for them, and besides, she had no intention of the
kind.&nbsp; She wished it to be distinctly understood that Master
Owen was not to be looked upon as her heir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very true, ma&rsquo;am, it is too soon to be talking of
such things yet, and I must say, I was as sorry as possible to
find that the child had had it named to him.&nbsp; People will
talk, you see, Miss Charlecote, though I am sure so young a lady
as you are . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That has nothing to do with it,&rsquo; said Honora;
&lsquo;I consider nothing so bad for a child as to be brought up
to expectations to which he has no right, when he is sure to have
to provide for himself.&nbsp; I beg that if you hear the subject
entered on again, in the children&rsquo;s presence, you will put
a stop to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, ma&rsquo;am; their poor dear papa never
would have wished them to be occupied with earthly things of that
sort.&nbsp; As I often said, there never was such an unworldly
gentleman; he never would have known if there were a sixpence in
the house, nor a joint in the larder, if there had not been cook
and me to care for him.&nbsp; I often said to
cook&mdash;&ldquo;Well for him that he has honest people about
him.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora likewise spoke to Jones, her private retainer.&nbsp; He
smiled scorn of the accusation, and answered her as the child he
had known in frocks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I did tell
the young gentleman to hold his tongue, for it never would be his
in your lifetime, nor after, in my judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, certainly, it does seem early days to speak of
such a matter,&rsquo; said Honora, sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is unaccountable what people will not put in
children&rsquo;s heads,&rsquo; said Jones, sagely; &lsquo;not but
what he is a nice quiet young gentleman, and gives very little
trouble, but they might let <i>that</i> alone.&nbsp; Miss Honora,
when will it be convenient to you to take my account of the
plate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt pretty well convinced that Jones had only resented
the whole on her account, and that it was not he who had put the
notion into the boy&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; As to nurse, she was far
from equally clear.&nbsp; Doubts of nurse&rsquo;s sincerity had
long been growing upon her, and she was in the uncomfortable
position of being able to bear neither to think of the
children&rsquo;s intercourse with any one tainted with falsehood,
nor to dismiss a person implicitly trusted by their father.&nbsp;
She could only decide that the first detected act of untruth
should be the turning-point.</p>
<p>Meantime, painful as was many an association, Honor did not
find her position so dreary or so oppressive as she had <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>anticipated.&nbsp; She had a great deal to do, and the
tracks had been duly made out for her by her cousin.&nbsp; Mr.
Saville, or Humfrey&rsquo;s old friend, Sir John Raymond, were
always ready to help her in great matters, and Brooks was an
excellent dictatorial deputy in small ones.&nbsp; Her real love
for country life, for live animals, and, above all, the power of
doing good, all found scope.&nbsp; Humfrey&rsquo;s charge gave
her a sense of a fulfilled duty; and mournful and broken-spirited
as she believed herself, if Humfrey could have looked at her as
she scrupulously made entries in his book, rode out with the
children to try to look knowing at the crops, or sat by the fire
in the evening with his dogs at her feet, telling stories to the
children, he would not have feared too much for his Honor.&nbsp;
Living or dead, the love of Humfrey could hardly help being a
spring of peace and happiness; and the consciousness of it had
been too brief, and the tie never close enough, to lead to a
state of crushed spirits.&nbsp; The many little tender
observances that she paid to him were a source of mournful
sweetness rather than of heart-rending.</p>
<p>It was a quietly but fully occupied life, with a certain
severity towards her own comforts, and liberality towards those
of other people, which had always been a part of her character,
ever since Owen Sandbrook had read sermons with her on
self-denial.&nbsp; If Miss Wells had a fire in her bedroom forced
upon her, Miss Charlecote had none, and hurried down in the bleak
winter morning in shawl and gloves to Humfrey&rsquo;s great
Bible, and then to his account books and her business
letters.&nbsp; She was fresh with cold when she met the children
for their early reading.&nbsp; And then&mdash;but it was not soon
that she learnt to bear that, though she had gone through the
like before, she had to read the household devotions, where every
petition seemed to be lacking the manly tone to give it fulness
and force.</p>
<p>Breakfast followed, the silver kettle making it home-like, the
children chattering, Miss Wells smiling, letters coming in to
perplex or to clear up perplexities, amuse or cheer.&nbsp; The
children were then turned out for an hour&rsquo;s hoop-driving on
the gravel drive, horse-chestnut picking, or whatever might not
be mischief, while Honora was conferring with Jones or with
Brooks, and receiving her orders for the day.&nbsp; Next followed
letter-writing, then lessons in general, a real enjoyment, unless
Lucilla happened to have picked up a fit of
perverseness&mdash;some reading to them, or rationalizing of
play&mdash;the early dinner&mdash;the subsequent expedition with
them, either walking or riding&mdash;for Brooks had soon found
ponies for them, and they were gallant little riders.&nbsp; Honor
would not give up the old pony, long since trained for her by
Humfrey, though, maybe, that was her most undutiful proceeding
towards him, as he would certainly have told her that the
creature was shaky on the legs.&nbsp; So at last it tumbled down
with her, but without any damage, save a hole in her skirt, and a
dreadful crying fit of little Owen, who was frightened out of his
wits.&nbsp; She owned that it must be degraded <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>to light cart
work, and mounted an animal which Hiltonbury agreed to be more
worthy of her.&nbsp; Coming in, the children played; she either
did her business or found leisure for reading; then came
tea-time, then the reading of a story book to the children, and
when they were disposed of, of something mildly moral and
instructive to suit Miss Wells&rsquo;s taste.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood all mourned Mr. Charlecote as a personal
loss, and could hardly help regarding any successor as their
enemy.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote had been just enough known in her
girlish days not to make her popular in a commonplace
neighbourhood; the ladies had criticised her hair and her genius,
and the gentlemen had been puzzled by her searching questions
into their county antiquities, and obliged to own themselves
unaware of a Roman milestone propping their bailiff&rsquo;s
pigstye, or of the spur of a champion of one of the Roses being
hung over their family pew.&nbsp; But when Mr. Henderson and the
Raymonds reported pleasantly of her, and when once or twice she
had been seen cantering down the lanes, or shopping in
Elverslope, and had exchanged a bow with a familiar face, the
gentlemen took to declaring that the heiress was an uncommonly
fine woman after all, and the ladies became possessed with the
perception that it was high time to call upon Miss
Charlecote&mdash;what could she be doing with those two
children?</p>
<p>So there were calls, which Honor duly returned, and then came
invitations, but to Miss Wells&rsquo;s great annoyance, Honor
decided against these.&nbsp; It was not self-denial, but she
thought it suitable.&nbsp; She did not love the round of county
gaieties, and in her position she did not think them a
duty.&nbsp; Retirement seemed to befit the widowhood, which she
felt so entirely that when Miss Wells once drove her into
disclaiming all possibility of marrying, she called it
&lsquo;marrying again.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Miss Wells urged the
inexpedience of absolute seclusion, she said she would continue
to make morning calls, and she hoped in time to have friends of
her own to stay with her; she might ask the Raymonds, or some of
the quiet, clerical families (the real <i>&eacute;lite</i>, be it
observed) to spend a day or drink tea, but the dinner and ball
life was too utterly incongruous for an elderly heiress.&nbsp;
When it came to the elderly heiress poor Miss Wells was always
shut up in utter despair&mdash;she who thought her bright-locked
darling only grew handsomer each day of her pride of
womanhood.</p>
<p>The brass which Honora had chosen for her cousin&rsquo;s
memorial was slow in being executed, and summer days had come in
before it was sent to Hiltonbury.&nbsp; She walked down, a good
deal agitated, to ascertain whether it were being rightly
managed, but, to her great annoyance, found that the church
having been left open, so many idle people were standing about
that she could not bear to mingle with them.&nbsp; Had it been
only the Holt vassalage, either their feeling would have been one
with her own, or they would have made way for her, but there were
some pert nursery maids gaping about with the children from <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Beauchamp, whence the heads of the family had been
absent all the winter and spring, leaving various nurses and
governesses in charge.&nbsp; Honora could not encounter their
eyes, and went to the vicarage to send Mr. Henderson, and finding
him absent, walked over sundry fields in a vain search for
Brooks.&nbsp; Rain came on so violently as to wet her
considerably, and to her exceeding mortification, she was obliged
to relinquish her superintendence, either in person or by
deputy.</p>
<p>However, when she awoke early and saw the sun laughing through
the shining drops, she decided on going down ere the curious
world was astir, to see what had been done.&nbsp; It was not far
from six, when she let herself out at the porch, and very like a
morning with Humfrey, with the tremulous glistening of every
spray, and the steamy fragrance rising wherever the sun touched
the grass, that seemed almost to grow visibly.&nbsp; The woods
were ringing with the song of birds, circle beyond circle, and
there was something in the exuberant merriment of those
blackbirds and thrushes that would not let her be sad, though
they had been Humfrey&rsquo;s special glory.&nbsp; The thought of
such pleasures did not seem out of keeping.&nbsp; The lane was
overhung with bushes; the banks, a whole wealth of ferns,
climbing plants, tall grasses, and nettles, had not yet felt the
sun and were dank and dreary, so she hurried on, and arriving at
the clerk&rsquo;s door, knocked and opened.&nbsp; He was gone to
his work, and sounds above showed the wife to be engaged on the
toilette of the younger branches.&nbsp; She called out that she
had come for the keys of the church, and seeing them on the
dresser, abstracted them, bidding the good woman give herself no
trouble.</p>
<p>She paused under the porch, and ere fitting the heavy key to
the lock, felt that strange pressure and emotion of the heart
that even if it be sorrow is also an exquisite sensation.&nbsp;
If it were mournful that the one last office she could render to
Humfrey was over, it was precious to her to be the only one who
had a right to pay it, the one whom he had loved best upon earth,
round whom she liked to believe that he still might be often
hovering&mdash;whom he might welcome by and by.&nbsp; Here was
the place for communion with him, the spot which had, indeed,
been to him none other than the gate of Heaven.</p>
<p>Yet, will it be believed?&nbsp; Not one look did Honora cast
at Humfrey Charlecote&rsquo;s monument that morning.</p>
<p>With both hands she turned the reluctant bolts of the lock,
and pushed open the nail-studded door.&nbsp; She slowly advanced
along the uneven floor of the aisle, and had just reached the
chancel arch, when something suddenly stirred, making her start
violently.&nbsp; It was still, and after a pause she again
advanced, but her heart gave a sudden throb, and a strange chill
of awe rushed over her as she beheld a little white face over the
altar rail, the chin resting on a pair of folded hands, the dark
eyes fixed in a strange, dreamy, spiritual expression of awe.</p>
<p>The shock was but for a moment, the next the blood rallied
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>to her heart, and she told herself that Humfrey would
say, that either the state of her spirits had produced an
illusion, or else that some child had been left here by
accident.&nbsp; She advanced, but as she did so the two hands
were stretched out and locked together as in an agony, and the
childish, feeble voice cried out, &lsquo;Oh! if you&rsquo;re an
angel, please don&rsquo;t frighten me; I&rsquo;ll be very
good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora was in a pale, soft, gray dress, that caught the light
in a rosy glow from the east window, and her golden hair was
hanging in radiant masses beneath her straw bonnet, but she could
not appreciate the angelic impression she made on the child, who
had been tried so long by such a captivity.&nbsp; &lsquo;My poor
child,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am no angel; I am only Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid you have been shut up
here;&rsquo; and, coming nearer, she perceived that it was a boy
of about seven years old, well dressed, though his garments were
disordered.&nbsp; He stood up as she came near, but he was
trembling all over, and as she drew him into her bosom, and put
her arms round him, she found him quivering with icy cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little fellow,&rsquo; she said, rocking him, as
she sat on the step and folded her shawl round him, &lsquo;have
you been here all night?&nbsp; How cold you are; I must take you
home, my dear.&nbsp; What is your name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m Robert Mervyn Fulmort,&rsquo; said the little
boy, clinging to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;We came in to see Mr.
Charlecote&rsquo;s monument put up, and I suppose they forgot
me.&nbsp; I waked up, and everybody was gone, and the door was
locked.&nbsp; Oh! please,&rsquo; he gasped, &lsquo;take me
out.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She thought it best to take him at once into the cheerful
sunlight, but it did not yet yield the warmth that he needed; and
all her soothing words could not check the nervous tremor, though
he held her so tight that it seemed as if he would never let her
go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall come home with me, my dear little boy; you
shall have some breakfast, and then I will take you safe home to
Beauchamp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if you please!&rsquo; said the boy, gratefully.</p>
<p>Exercise was thawing his numbed limbs, and his eyes
brightened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom were you with?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who
could have forgotten you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came with Lieschen and nurse and the babies.&nbsp;
The others went out with Mademoiselle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you went to sleep?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I liked to see the mason go chip, chip, and I
wanted to see them fit the thing in.&nbsp; I got into that great
pew, to see better; and I made myself a nest, but at last they
were all gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did you do, then?&nbsp; Were you
afraid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp; I ran all about
to see if I could look out at a window, but I
couldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you try to call?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been naughty?&rsquo; said
the boy; and then with an impulse of honest truthfulness,
&lsquo;I did try once; but do you know, there was another voice
came back again, and I thought that <i>die Geistern wachten sich
auf</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Die Geistern das Lieschen sagt in die Gewolben
wohnen</i>,&rsquo; said little Robert, evidently quite
unconscious whether he spoke German or English.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you could not call for the echo.&nbsp; Well, did you
not think of the bells?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but, oh! the door was shut; and then, I&rsquo;ll
tell you&mdash;but don&rsquo;t tell Mervyn&mdash;I did
cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t wonder.&nbsp; It must have been
very lonely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rsquo; said Robert, shivering;
and getting to his German again, he described &lsquo;<i>das
Gewitter</i>&rsquo; beating on the panes, with wind and whirling
leaves, and the unearthly noises of the creaking vane.&nbsp; The
terror of the lonely, supperless child was dreadful to think of;
and she begged to know what he could have done as it grew
dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I got to Mr. Charlecote,&rsquo; said Robert&mdash;an
answer that thrilled her all over.&nbsp; &lsquo;I said I&rsquo;d
be always very good, if he would take care of me, and not let
them frighten me.&nbsp; And so I did go to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Charlecote would, my dear little
man,&rsquo; began Honora, then checked by remembering what he
would have said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But didn&rsquo;t you think of One
more sure to take care of you than Mr. Charlecote?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lieschen talks of <i>der Lieber Gott</i>,&rsquo; said
the little boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;We said our prayers in the nursery,
but Mervyn says only babies do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn is terribly wrong, then,&rsquo; said Honora,
shuddering.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! Robert, Mr. Charlecote never got up
nor went to bed without asking the good God to take care of him,
and make him good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was that why he was so good?&rsquo; asked Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed it was,&rsquo; said she, fervently;
&lsquo;nobody can be good without it.&nbsp; I hope my little
friend will never miss his prayers again, for they are the only
way to be manly and afraid of nothing but doing wrong, as he
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t miss them,&rsquo; said Robert, eagerly;
then, with a sudden, puzzled look&mdash;&lsquo;Did he send
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;how should . . . ?&nbsp; What made you think
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;why, once in the night I woke up; and oh! it
was so dark, and there were such noises, such rattlings and
roarings; and then it came all white&mdash;white light&mdash;all
the window-bars and all so plain upon the wall; and then
came&mdash;bending, bending over&mdash;a great gray
darkness&mdash;oh! so horrible!&mdash;and went away, and came
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The shadow of the trees, swaying in the
moonlight.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&lsquo;Was it?&nbsp; I thought it was the <i>Nebel
Wittwen neckten mir</i>, and then the
<i>Erlkonung-tochter</i>.&nbsp; <i>Wissen sie</i>&mdash;and oh! I
did scream once; and then, somehow, it grew quietly darker; and I
thought Mr. Charlecote had me folded up so warm on his
horse&rsquo;s back, and that we rode ever so far; and they
stretched out their long white arms, and could not get me; but
somehow he set me down on a cold stone, and said, &ldquo;Wait
here, Robin, and I&rsquo;ll send her to lead you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then came a creaking, and there were you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, little Robin, he did not quite send me; but it
was to see his tablet that I came down this morning; so he
brought me after all.&nbsp; He was my very dear Cousin Humfrey,
and I like you for having been his little friend.&nbsp; Will you
be mine, too, and let me help you, if I can? and if your papa and
mamma give leave, come and see me, and play with the little girl
and boy who live with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; cried Robert; &lsquo;I like
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The alliance was sealed with a hearty kiss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;you must ask
Mademoiselle; papa and mamma are away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how was it no one ever missed you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert was far less surprised at this than she was; for, like
all children, to be left behind appeared to him a contingency
rather probable than otherwise.</p>
<p>He was a fine-looking boy, with dark gray, thoughtful eyes,
and a pleasant countenance; but his nerves had been so much
shaken that he started, and seemed ready to catch hold of her at
every sound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he cried, as a trampling came
along the alley as they entered the garden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only my two little cousins,&rsquo; said Honora,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope you will be good friends, though
perhaps Owen is too young a playfellow.&nbsp; Here, Lucy,
Owen&mdash;here is a little friend for you&mdash;Robert
Fulmort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The children came eagerly up, and Lucilla, taking her hand,
raised her face to kiss the stranger; but Robert did not approve
of the proceeding, and held up his head.&nbsp; Lucilla rose on
tiptoe; Robin did the same.&nbsp; As he had the advantage of a
whole year&rsquo;s height, he fully succeeded in keeping out of
her reach; and very comical was the effect.&nbsp; She gave it up
at last, and contented herself with asking, &lsquo;And where do
you come from?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of the church,&rsquo; was Robin&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are very good and holy, indeed,&rsquo; said
Owen, looking at him earnestly, with clasped hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Robert, gruffly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little man! he was left behind, and shut up in the
church all night, without any supper,&rsquo; said Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shut up in the church like Goody Two-shoes!&rsquo;
cried Lucilla dancing about.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, what
fun!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did the angels come and sing to you?&rsquo; asked
Owen.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask such stupid questions,&rsquo;
cried his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I know what I&rsquo;d have
done!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you get up into the pulpit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I do so want to know if the lady and gentleman on
the monument have their ruffs the same on the inside, towards the
wall, as outside; and, oh! I do so want to get all the dust out
of the folds of the lady&rsquo;s ruff: I wish they&rsquo;d lock
me into the church, and I&rsquo;d soon get out when I was
tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla and Owen decidedly thought Robin had not profited by
his opportunities, but he figured better in an examination on his
brothers and sisters.&nbsp; There were seven, of whom he was the
fourth&mdash;Augusta, Juliana, and Mervyn being his elders;
Ph&oelig;be, Maria, and Bertha, his juniors.&nbsp; The three
seniors were under the rule of Mademoiselle, the little ones
under that of nurse and Lieschen, and Robert stood on neutral
ground, doing lessons with Mademoiselle, whom, he said, in
unpicked language which astounded little Owen, &lsquo;he morally
hated,&rsquo; and at the same time free of the nursery, where, it
appeared, that &lsquo;Ph&oelig;be was the jolliest little fellow
in the world,&rsquo; and Lieschen was the only
&lsquo;good-natured body going,&rsquo; and knew no end of
<i>M&auml;hrchen</i>.&nbsp; The boy spoke a very odd mixture of
Lieschen&rsquo;s German and of English, pervaded by stable slang,
and was altogether a curious study of the effects of absentee
parents; nevertheless Honora and Lucilla both took a considerable
fancy to him, the latter patronizing him to such a degree that
she hardly allowed him to eat the much-needed breakfast, which
recalled colour to his cheek and substance to his voice.</p>
<p>After much thought, Owen delivered himself of the sentiment
that &lsquo;people&rsquo;s papas and mammas were very
funny,&rsquo; doubtless philosophizing on the inconsistency of
the class in being, some so willing, some so reluctant, to leave
their children behind them.&nbsp; Honor fully agreed with him,
but did not think the discussion profitable for Robin, whom she
now proposed to take home in the pony-carriage.&nbsp; Lucilla,
always eager for novelty, and ardent for her new friendship,
begged to accompany her.&nbsp; Owen was afraid of the strangers,
and preferred Miss Wells.</p>
<p>Even as they set out, they found that Robert&rsquo;s
disappearance had created some sensation, for the clerk&rsquo;s
wife was hurrying up to ask if Miss Charlecote had the keys, that
she might satisfy the man from Beauchamp that Master Fulmort was
not in the church.&nbsp; At the lodge the woman threw up her
hands with joy at the sight of the child; and some way off, on
the sward, stood a bigger boy, who, with a loud hurrah, scoured
away towards the house as the carriage appeared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Mervyn,&rsquo; said Robert; &lsquo;he is
gone to tell them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Beauchamp was many degrees grander since Honor had last
visited it.&nbsp; The approach was entirely new.&nbsp; Two fresh
wings had been added, and the front was all over scaffolds and
cement, in all stages of colour, from rich brown to permanent
white.&nbsp; Robert explained that nothing was so nice as to
watch the <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>workmen, and showed Lucilla a
plasterer on the topmost stage of the scaffolding, who, he said,
was the nicest man he knew, and could sing all manner of
songs.</p>
<p>Rather nervously Honora drove under the poles to the
hall-door, where two girls were seen in the rear of a
Frenchwoman; and Honor felt as if Robin might have grounds for
his &lsquo;moral hatred&rsquo; when her voluble transports of
gratitude and affection broke forth, and the desolation in which
the loss had left them was described.&nbsp; Robert edged back
from her at once, and flew to another party at the bottom of the
stairs&mdash;a very stout nurse and an uncapped, flaxen-haired
m&auml;dchen, who clasped him in her arms, and cried, and sobbed
over him.&nbsp; As soon as he could release himself, he caught
hold of a fat little bundle, which had been coaxing one of his
legs all through Lieschen&rsquo;s embrace, and dragging it
forwards, cried, &lsquo;Here she is&mdash;here&rsquo;s
Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, however, was shy, and
cried and fought her way back to hide her face in
Lieschen&rsquo;s apron; and meantime a very odd scene took
place.&nbsp; School-room and nursery were evidently at most
direful war.&nbsp; Each wanted to justify itself lest the lady
should write to the parents; each tried to be too grand to seem
to care, and threw all the blame on the other.&nbsp; On the
whole, Honor gathered that Mademoiselle believed the boy
<i>enfantin</i> enough to be in the nursery, the nurses that he
was in the school-room, and he had not been really missed till
bed-time, when each party recriminated instead of seeking him,
and neither would allow itself to be responsible for him.&nbsp;
Lieschen, who alone had her suspicions where he might be,
abstained from naming them in sheer terror of <i>Kobolden</i>,
<i>Geistern</i>, corpse-candles, and what not, and had lain
conjuring up his miseries till morning.&nbsp; Honora did not much
care how they settled it amongst them, but tried to make friends
with the young people, who seemed to take their brother&rsquo;s
restoration rather coolly, and to be chiefly occupied by staring
at Lucilla.&nbsp; Augusta and Juliana were self-possessed, and
rather <i>mani&eacute;r&eacute;es</i>, acquitting themselves
evidently to the satisfaction of the French governess, and Honor,
perceiving her to be a necessary infliction, invited her and her
pupils, especially Robin, to spend a day in the next week at the
Holt.</p>
<p>The proposal was graciously accepted, and Lucilla spent the
intervening time in a tumult of excitement.</p>
<p>Nor was the day entirely unsuccessful; Mademoiselle behaved
herself with French tact, and Miss Wells took her off
Honora&rsquo;s hands a good deal, leaving them free for the
children.&nbsp; Lucilla, always aspiring, began a grand
whispering friendship with the two girls, and set her little cap
strongly at Mervyn, but that young gentleman was contemptuous and
bored when he found no entertainment in Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
stud, and was only to be kept placable by the bagatelle-board and
the strawberry-bed.&nbsp; Robert followed his lead more than was
satisfactory, but with visible predilections for the Holt ladies,
old and young.&nbsp; Honor <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>talked to him
about little Ph&oelig;be, and he lighted up and began to detail
her accomplishments, and to be very communicative about his home
vexations and pleasures, and finally, when the children were
wishing good night, he bluntly said, &lsquo;It would be better
fun to bring Lieschen and Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor thought so too, and proposed giving the invitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;she&rsquo;d be
cross; I&rsquo;ll bring them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so he did.&nbsp; Two days after, the broad German face and
the flaxen head appeared, leading that fat ball, Ph&oelig;be, and
Robin frisking in triumph beside her.&nbsp; Henceforth a great
friendship arose between the children.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be soon
lost all dread of those who petted her, and favoured them with
broad smiles and an incomprehensible patois.&nbsp; Owen made very
much of her, and pursued and imitated Robert with the devotion of
a small boy to a larger one.&nbsp; Lucilla devoted herself to him
for want of better game, and moreover he plainly told her that
she was the prettiest little girl he ever saw, and laid all
manner of remarkable treasures at her feet.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote
believed that he made some curious confidences to her, for once
Owen said, &lsquo;I want to know why Robin hasn&rsquo;t a Sweet
Honey to make him good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robin has a papa and mamma, and a governess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robin was telling Lucy he wanted some one to teach him
to be good, and she said she would, but I think she is not old
enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any one who is good is teaching others, my Owen,&rsquo;
said Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will ask in our prayers that poor
little Robin may be helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Fulmort came home, there was an interchange
of calls, many thanks for her kindness to the children, and
sanction of future intercourse.&nbsp; Mr. Fulmort was a great
distiller, who had married a county heiress, and endeavoured to
take his place among the country squires, whom he far exceeded in
display; and his wife, a meek, sickly person, lived a life of
slavery to the supposed exigencies of fashion.&nbsp; She had
always had, in her maiden days, a species of awe of the
Charlecotes&rsquo; London cousin, and was now disposed to be
rather gratified by her notice of her children.&nbsp; Mervyn had
been disposed of at a tutor&rsquo;s, and Robert was adrift for
many hours of the day.&nbsp; As soon as he had discovered the
possibility of getting to the Holt alone, he was frequently
there, following Honora about in her gardening and farming, as
much at home as the little Sandbrooks, sharing in their sports,
and often listening to the little books that she read aloud to
them.&nbsp; He was very far from being such an angelic little
mortal as Owen, with whom indeed his sympathies were few.&nbsp;
Once some words were caught from him by both children, which
startled Honor exceedingly, and obliged her to tell him that if
ever she found him to have repeated the like, she should forbid
his coming near them.&nbsp; He looked excessively sullen, and did
not come for a week, during which Lucilla was intolerably
naughty, and was twice severely punished for using the identical
expressions in defiance.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Then he came again, and behaved as if nothing had
happened, but the offence never recurred.&nbsp; Some time after,
when he boasted of having come away with a lesson unlearnt, in
flat disobedience to Mademoiselle, Honor sent him straight home,
though Lucilla stamped and danced at her in a frenzy.&nbsp;
Another time Owen rushed up to her in great agony at some torture
that Robin was inflicting upon a live mouse.&nbsp; Upon this,
Honor, full of the spirit of indignation, fairly struck the
offender sharply on the fingers with her riding-whip.&nbsp; He
scowled at her, but it was only for a moment.&nbsp; She held him
tightly by the hand, while she sent the gardener to put his
victim out of its misery, and then she talked to him, not
sentimentally, her feelings were too strongly stirred, but with
all her horror of cruelty.&nbsp; He muttered that Mervyn and the
grooms always did it; but he did not hold out long&mdash;Lucilla
was holding aloof, too much horrified to come near&mdash;and
finally he burst into tears, and owned that he had never
thought!</p>
<p>Every now and then, such outbreaks made Honor wonder why she
let him come, perhaps to tempt her children; but she remembered
that he and Humfrey had been fond of one another, and she felt
drawn towards him, though in all prudence she resolved to lessen
the attractions of the Holt by being very strict with all, and
rather ungracious to him.&nbsp; Yet, strange to say, the more
regulations she made, and the more she flashed out at his faults,
the more constant was her visitor, the Robin who seemed to thrive
upon the veriest crumbs of good-nature.</p>
<p>Positively, Honora was sometimes amazed to find what a dragon
she could be upon occasion.&nbsp; Since she had been brought into
subordination at six or eight years old, she had never had
occasion to find out that she had a spirit of her own, till she
found herself astonishing Jones and Brooks for taking the liberty
of having a deadly feud; making Brooks understand that cows were
not to be sold, nor promises made to tenants, without reference
to her; or showing a determined marauder that Humfrey&rsquo;s
wood was not to be preyed upon any more than in his own
time.&nbsp; They were very feminine explosions to be sure, but
they had their effect, and Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s was a real
government.</p>
<p>The uproar with nurse came at last, through a chance discovery
that she had taken Owen to a certain forbidden house of gossip,
where he had been bribed to secrecy with bread and treacle.</p>
<p>Honora wrote to Mrs. Charteris for permission to dismiss the
mischievous woman, and obtained full consent, and the most
complete expression of confidence and gratitude.&nbsp; So there
ensued a month, when every visit to the nursery seemed to be
spent in tears.&nbsp; Nurse was really very fond of the children,
and cried over them incessantly, only consoling herself by
auguring a brilliant future for them, when Master Owen should
reign over Hiltonbury, like the gentleman he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, nurse, Cousin Honor says I never
shall&mdash;I&rsquo;m to be a clergyman, like papa.&nbsp; She
says . . . &lsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Nurse winked knowingly at the housemaid.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, yes, my darling, no one likes to hear who is to come
after them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you say nothing about it;
ain&rsquo;t becoming; but, by and by, see if it don&rsquo;t come
so, and if my boy ain&rsquo;t master here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I was, and then nursey would never
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, nurse did go, and after some tears Owen was consoled
by promotion to the habits of an older boy.</p>
<p>Lucilla was very angry, and revenged herself by every variety
of opposition in her power, all which were put down by the strong
hand.&nbsp; It was a matter of necessity to keep a tight grasp on
this little wilful sprite, the most fiery morsel of engaging
caprice and naughtiness that a quiet spinster could well have lit
upon.&nbsp; It really sometimes seemed to Honora as if there were
scarcely a fault in the range of possibilities that she had not
committed; and indeed a bit of good advice generally seemed to
act by contraries, and served to suggest mischief.&nbsp; Softness
and warmth of feeling seemed to have been lost with her father;
she did not show any particular affection towards her brother or
Honora.&nbsp; Perhaps she liked Miss Wells, but that might be
only opposition; nay, Honor would have been almost thankful if
she had melted at the departure of the undesirable nurse, but she
appeared only hard and cross.&nbsp; If she liked any one it was
Robert Fulmort, but that was too much in the way of
flirtation.</p>
<p>Vanity was an extremely traceable spring of action.&nbsp; When
nurse went, Miss Lucilla gave the household no peace, because no
one could rightly curl the long flaxen tresses upon her
shoulders, until the worry became so intolerable that Honora,
partly as penance, partly because she thought the present mode
neither conducive to tidiness nor comfort, took her scissors and
trimmed all the ringlets behind, bowl-dish fashion, as her own
carrots had figured all the days of her childhood.</p>
<p>Lucilla was held by Mrs. Stubbs during the operation.&nbsp;
She did not cry or scream after she felt herself conquered by
main strength, but her blue eyes gleamed with a strange, wild
light; she would not speak to Miss Charlecote all the rest of the
day, and Honora doubted whether she were ever forgiven.</p>
<p>Another offence was the cutting down her name into Lucy.&nbsp;
Honor had avoided Cilly from the first; Silly Sandbrook would be
too dreadful a sobriquet to be allowed to attach to any one, but
Lucilla resented the change more deeply than she showed.&nbsp;
Lucy was a housemaid&rsquo;s name, she said, and Honor reproved
her for vanity, and called her so all the more.&nbsp; She did not
love Miss Charlecote well enough to say that Cilly had been her
father&rsquo;s name for her, and that he had loved to wind the
flaxen curls round his fingers.</p>
<p>Every new study, every new injunction cost a warfare,
disobedience, and passionate defiance and resistance on the one
hand, and steady, good-tempered firmness on the other, gradually
growing a little stern.&nbsp; The waves became weary of beating
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>on the rock at last.&nbsp; The fiery child was growing
into a girl, and the calm will had the mastery of her; she
succumbed insensibly; and owing all her pleasures to Cousin
Honor, she grew to depend upon her, and mind, manners, and
opinions were taking their mould from her.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<blockquote><p>Too soon the happy child<br />
His nook of heavenward thought must change<br />
For life&rsquo;s seducing wild.&mdash;<i>Christian Year</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The summer sun peeped through the Venetian blinds greenly
shading the breakfast-table.</p>
<p>Only three sides were occupied.&nbsp; For more than two years
past good Miss Wells had been lying under the shade of Hiltonbury
Church, taking with her Honora Charlecote&rsquo;s last semblance
of the dependence and deference of her young ladyhood.&nbsp; The
kind governess had been fondly mourned, but she had not left her
child to loneliness, for the brother and sister sat on either
side, each with a particular pet&mdash;Lucilla&rsquo;s, a large
pointer, who kept his nose on her knee; Owen&rsquo;s, a white
fan-tailed pigeon, seldom long absent from his shoulder, where it
sat quivering and bending backwards its graceful head.</p>
<p>Lucilla, now nearly fourteen, looked younger from the unusual
smallness of her stature, and the exceeding delicacy of her
features and complexion, and she would never have been imagined
to be two years the senior of the handsome-faced, large-limbed
young Saxon who had so far outstripped her in height; and yet
there was something in those deep blue eyes, that on a second
glance proclaimed a keen intelligence as much above her age as
her appearance was below it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said she, rather
suddenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sweetest Honey,&rsquo; added the boy, &lsquo;you
look bothered.&nbsp; Is that rascal not paying his
rent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it is a different matter
entirely.&nbsp; What do you think of an invitation to Castle
Blanch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For us all?&rsquo; asked Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, all, to meet your Uncle Christopher, the last week
in August.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t he come here?&rsquo; asked Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe we must go,&rsquo; said Honora.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You ought to know both your uncles, and they should be
consulted before Owen goes to school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if they will examine me,&rsquo; said
Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;How they will stare to find Sweet
Honey&rsquo;s teaching as good as all their preparatory
schools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conceited boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not conceited&mdash;only in my teacher.&nbsp;
Mr. Henderson said <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>I should take as good a place as
Robert Fulmort did at Winchester, after four years in that
humbugging place at Elverslope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go!&rsquo; cried Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the last week of Robin&rsquo;s
holidays!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Lucy!&rsquo; and both Honor and Owen laughed
heartily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is nothing to me,&rsquo; said she, tossing her head,
&lsquo;only I thought Cousin Honor thought it good for
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may stay at home to do him good,&rsquo; laughed
Owen; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want him.&nbsp; You are
very welcome, such a bore as he is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Owen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honey dear, I do take my solemn affidavit that I have
tried my utmost to be friends with him,&rsquo; said Owen;
&lsquo;but he is such a fellow&mdash;never has the least notion
beyond Winchester routine&mdash;Latin and Greek, cricket and
football.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be a schoolboy yourself,&rsquo; said
Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shan&rsquo;t make such an ass of myself,&rsquo;
returned Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robin is a very good boy, I believe,&rsquo; said
Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of him!&rsquo; cried Lucilla,
running away and clapping the door after her as she went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Owen, very
seriously, &lsquo;he says he does not care about the
Saints&rsquo; days because he has no one to get him leave
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember,&rsquo; said Honor, with a sweet smile of
tender memory, &lsquo;when to me the merit of Saints&rsquo; days
was that they were your father&rsquo;s holidays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll send me to Westminster, and be always
coming to Woolstone-lane,&rsquo; said Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your uncles must decide,&rsquo; she said, half
mournfully, half proudly; &lsquo;you are getting to be a big
boy&mdash;past me, Oney.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It brought her a roughly playful caress, and he added,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got the best right, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had thought of Winchester,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Robert would be a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen made a face, and caused her to laugh, while scandalizing
her by humming, &lsquo;Not there, not there, my child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, be it where it may, you had better look over your
Virgil, while I go down to my practical Georgics with
Brooks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen obeyed.&nbsp; He was like a spirited horse in a leash of
silk.&nbsp; Strong, fearless, and manly, he was still perfectly
amenable to her, and had never shown any impatience of her
rule.&nbsp; She had taught him entirely herself, and both working
together with a thorough good will, she had rendered him a better
classical scholar, as all judges allowed, than most boys of the
same age, and far superior to them in general cultivation; and
she should be proud to convince Captain Charteris that she had
not made him the mollycoddle that was obviously
anticipated.&nbsp; The other relatives, who had seen the children
in their yearly visits to London, had always expressed
unqualified satisfaction, though <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>not advancing
much in the good graces of Lucy and Owen.&nbsp; But Honor thought
the public school ought to be left to the selection of the two
uncles, though she wished to be answerable for the expense, both
there and at the university.&nbsp; The provision inherited by her
charges was very slender, for, contrary to all expectation, old
Mr. Sandbrook&rsquo;s property had descended in another quarter,
and there was barely &pound;5000 between the two.</p>
<p>To preserve this untouched by the expenses of education was
Honora&rsquo;s object, and she hoped to be able to smooth their
path in life by occasional assistance, but on principle she was
determined to make them independent of her, and she had always
made it known that she regarded it as her duty to Humfrey that
her Hiltonbury property should be destined&mdash;if not to the
apocryphal American Charlecote&mdash;to a relation of their
mutual great-grandmother.</p>
<p>Cold invitations had been given and declined, but this one was
evidently in earnest, and the consideration of the captain
decided Honora on accepting it, but not without much murmuring
from Lucilla.&nbsp; Caroline and Horatia were detestable grown-up
young ladies, her aunt was horrid, Castle Blanch was the slowest
place in the world; she should be shut up in some abominable
school-room to do fancy-work, and never to get a bit of
fun.&nbsp; Even the being reminded of Wrapworth and its
associations only made her more cross.&nbsp; She was of a nature
to fly from thought or feeling&mdash;she was keen to perceive,
but hated reflection, and from the very violence of her feelings,
she unconsciously abhorred any awakening of them, and steeled
herself by levity.</p>
<p>Her distaste only gave way in Robert&rsquo;s presence, when
she appeared highly gratified by the change, certain that Castle
Blanch would be charming, and her cousin the Life-guardsman
especially so.&nbsp; The more disconsolate she saw Robert, the
higher rose her spirits, and his arrival to see the party off
sent her away in open triumph, glorifying her whole cousinhood
without a civil word to him; but when seated in the carriage she
launched at him a drawing, the favourite work of her leisure
hours, broke into unrestrained giggling at his grateful surprise,
and ere the wood was past, was almost strangled with sobs.</p>
<p>Castle Blanch was just beyond the suburbs of London, in
complete country, but with an immense neighbourhood, and not
half-an-hour by train from town.&nbsp; Honora drove all the way,
to enjoy the lovely Thames scenery to the full.&nbsp; They passed
through Wrapworth, and as they did so, Lucilla chattered to the
utmost, while Honora stole her hand over Owen&rsquo;s and gently
pressed it.&nbsp; He returned the squeeze with interest, and
looked up in her face with a loving smile&mdash;mother and home
were not wanting to him!</p>
<p>About two miles further on, and not in the same parish, began
the Castle Blanch demesne.&nbsp; The park sloped down to the
Thames, and was handsome, and quite full of timber, and <!-- page
79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>the
mansion, as the name imported, had been built in the height of
pseudo-Gothic, with a formidable keep-looking tower at each
corner, but the fortification below consisting of glass; the sham
cloister, likewise glass windows, for drawing-room, music-room,
and conservatory; and jutting out far in advance, a great
embattled gateway, with a sham portcullis, and doors fit to defy
an army.</p>
<p>Three men-servants met the guests in the hall, and Mrs.
Charteris received them in the drawing-room, with the
woman-of-the-world tact that Honora particularly hated; there was
always such deference to Miss Charlecote, and such an assumption
of affection for the children, and gratitude for her care of
them, and Miss Charlecote had not been an heiress early enough in
life for such attentions to seem matters of course.</p>
<p>It was explained that there was no school-room at present, and
as a girl of Lucilla&rsquo;s age, who was already a guest, joined
the rest of the party at dinner, it was proposed that she and her
brother should do the same, provided Miss Charlecote did not
object.&nbsp; Honor was really glad of the gratification for
Lucilla, and Mrs. Charteris agreed with her before she had time
to express her opinion as to girls being kept back or brought
forward.</p>
<p>Honor found herself lodged in great state, in a world of
looking-glass that had perfectly scared her poor little
Hiltonbury maiden, and with a large dressing-room, where she
hoped to have seen a bed for Lucilla, but she found that the
little girl was quartered in another story, near the cousins; and
unwilling to imply distrust, and hating to incite obsequious
compliance, she did not ask for any change, but only begged to
see the room.</p>
<p>It was in a long passage whence doors opened every way, and
one being left ajar, sounds of laughter and talking were heard in
tones as if the young ladies were above good breeding in their
private moments.&nbsp; Mrs. Charteris said something about her
daughters&rsquo; morning-room, and was leading the way thither,
when an unguarded voice exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Rouge dragon and
all,&rsquo; and a start and suppressed laughter at the entrance
of the newcomers gave an air of having been caught.</p>
<p>Four young ladies, in <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> attitudes,
were lounging round their afternoon refection of tea.&nbsp; Two,
Caroline and Horatia Charteris, shook hands with Miss Charlecote,
and kissed Lucilla, who still looked at them ungraciously,
followed Honora&rsquo;s example in refusing their offer of tea,
and only waiting to learn her own habitation, came down to her
room to be dressed for dinner, and to criticize cousins, aunt,
house and all.&nbsp; The cousins were not striking&mdash;both
were on a small scale, Caroline the best looking in features and
complexion, but Horatia the most vivacious and demonstrative, and
with an air of dash and fashion that was more effective than
beauty.&nbsp; Lucilla, not sensible to these advantages, broadly
declared both young ladies to be frights, and commented so freely
on them to the willing ears of Owen, who likewise came in to go
down under Sweet Honey&rsquo;s <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>protection,
as to call for a reproof from Honora, one of whose chief labours
ever was to destroy the little lady&rsquo;s faith in beauty, and
complacency in her own.</p>
<p>The latter sensation was strong in Honor herself, as she
walked into the room between her beautiful pair, and contrasted
Lucilla with her contemporary, a formed and finished young lady,
all plaits, ribbons, and bracelets&mdash;not half so pleasing an
object as the little maid in her white frock, blue sash, and
short wavy hair, though maybe there was something quaint in such
simplicity, to eyes trained by fashion instead of by good
taste.</p>
<p>Here was Captain Charteris, just what he had been when he went
away.&nbsp; How different from his stately, dull, wife-ridden
elder brother.&nbsp; So brisk, and blunt, and eager, quite
lifting his niece off her feet, and almost crushing her in his
embrace, telling her she was still but a hop-o&rsquo;-my-thumb,
and shaking hands with his nephew with a look of scrutiny that
brought the blood to the boy&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>His eyes were never off the children while he was listening to
Honora, and she perceived that what she said went for nothing; he
would form his judgment solely by what he observed for
himself.</p>
<p>At dinner, he was seated between Miss Charlecote and his
niece, and Honora was pleased with him for his neglect of her and
attention to his smaller neighbour, whose face soon sparkled with
merriment, while his increasing animation proved that the saucy
little woman was as usual enchanting him.&nbsp; Much that was
very entertaining was passing about tiger-hunting, when at
dessert, as he stretched out his arm to reach some water for her,
she exclaimed, &lsquo;Why, Uncle Kit, you <i>have</i> brought
away the marks! no use to deny it, the tigers did bite
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The palm of his hand certainly bore in purple, marks
resembling those of a set of teeth; and he looked meaningly at
Honora, as he quietly replied, &lsquo;Something rather like a
tigress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it was a bite, Uncle Kit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes,&rsquo; in a put-an-end-to-it tone, which silenced
Lucilla, her tact being much more ready when concerned with the
nobler sex.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room, Mrs. Charteris&rsquo;s civilities kept
Honora occupied, while she saw Owen bursting with some request,
and when at length he succeeded in claiming her attention, it was
to tell her of his cousin&rsquo;s offer to take him out shooting,
and his elder uncle&rsquo;s proviso that it must be with her
permission.&nbsp; He had gone out with the careful gamekeeper at
Hiltonbury, but this was a different matter, more trying to the
nerves of those who stayed at home.&nbsp; However, Honora
suspected that the uncle&rsquo;s opinion of her competence to be
trusted with Owen would be much diminished by any betrayal of
womanly terrors, and she made her only conditions that he should
mind Uncle Kit, and not go in front of the guns, otherwise he
would never be taken out again, a menace which she judiciously
thought more telling than that he would be shot.</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>By and by Mr. Charteris came to discuss subjects so
interesting to her as a farmer, that it was past nine
o&rsquo;clock before she looked round for her children.&nbsp;
Healthy as Lucilla was, her frame was so slight and
unsubstantial, and her spirits so excitable, that over-fatigue or
irregularity always told upon her strength and temper; for which
reason Honor had issued a decree that she should go to bed at
nine, and spend two hours of every morning in quiet employment,
as a counterbalance to the excitement of the visit.</p>
<p>Looking about to give the summons, Honor found that Owen had
disappeared.&nbsp; Unnoticed, and wearied by the agricultural
dialogue, he had hailed nine o&rsquo;clock as the moment of
release, and crept off with unobtrusive obedience, which Honor
doubly prized when she beheld his sister full of eagerness, among
cousins and gentlemen, at the racing game.&nbsp; Strongly
impelled to end it at once, Honor waited, however, till the
little white horseman had reached the goal, and just as
challenges to a fresh race were beginning, she came forward with
her needful summons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Miss Charlecote, how cruel!&rsquo; was the
universal cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t spare all the life of our game!&rsquo;
said Charles Charteris.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I solemnly declare we weren&rsquo;t betting,&rsquo;
cried Horatia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, the first
evening&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Honor, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t have her lying awake to be good for nothing
to-morrow, as she will do if you entertain her too
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another night, then, you promise,&rsquo; said
Charles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promise nothing but to do my best to keep her fit to
enjoy herself.&nbsp; Come, Lucy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The habit of obedience was fixed, but not the habit of
conquering annoyance, and Lucilla went off doggedly.&nbsp; Honora
would have accompanied her to soothe away her troubles, but her
cousin Ratia ran after her, and Captain Charteris stood in the
way, disposed to talk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Discipline,&rsquo; he said,
approvingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harsh discipline, I fear, it seemed to her, poor
child,&rsquo; said Honor; &lsquo;but she is so excitable that I
must try to keep her as quiet as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; said the captain; &lsquo;I like to see a
child a child still.&nbsp; You must have had some tussles with
that little spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few,&rsquo; she said, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is a
very good girl now, but it has been rather a contrast with her
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; quoth the captain; and mindful of the
milk-sop charge, Honora eagerly continued, &lsquo;You will soon
see what a spirit he has!&nbsp; He rides very well, and is quite
fearless.&nbsp; I have always wished him to be with other boys,
and there are some very nice ones near us&mdash;they think him a
capital cricketer, and you should see him run and
vault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is an active-looking chap,&rsquo; his uncle
granted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every one tells me he is quite able to make his way at
school; I am only anxious to know which public school you and
your brother would prefer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&lsquo;Only twelve last month, though you would take him
for fifteen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twelve; then there would be just time to send him to
Portsmouth, get him prepared for a naval cadetship, then, when I
go out with Sir David Horfield, I could take him under my own
eye, and make a man of him at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Captain Charteris,&rsquo; cried Honora, aghast,
&lsquo;his whole bent is towards his father&rsquo;s
profession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain had very nearly whistled, unable to conceive any
lad of spirit preferring study.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s wishes may be,
Kit,&rsquo; interposed the diplomatic elder brother, &lsquo;we
only desire to be guided by them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, indeed,&rsquo; cried Honor; &lsquo;I would not
think of such a responsibility, it can belong only to his nearer
connections;&rsquo; then, feeling as if this were casting him off
to be pressed by the sailor the next instant, she added, in
haste&mdash;&lsquo;Only I hoped it was understood&mdash;if you
will let me&mdash;the expenses of his education need not be
considered.&nbsp; And if he <i>might</i> be with me in the
holidays,&rsquo; she proceeded imploringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
Captain Charteris has seen more of him, I am sure he will think
it a pity that his talents . . .&rsquo; and there she stopped,
shocked at finding herself insulting the navy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a boy have no turn that way, it cannot be forced on
him,&rsquo; said the captain, moodily.</p>
<p>Honora pitied his disappointment, wondering whether he
ascribed it to her influence, and Mr. Charteris blandly expressed
great obligation and more complete resignation of the boy than
she desired; disclaimers ran into mere civilities, and she was
thankful to the captain for saying, shortly, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
leave it till we have seen more of the boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast was very late at Castle Blanch; and Honora expected
a tranquil hour in her dressing-room with her children, but Owen
alone appeared, anxious for the shooting, but already wearying to
be at home with his own pleasures, and indignant with everything,
especially the absence of family prayers.</p>
<p>The breakfast was long and desultory, and in the midst Lucilla
made her appearance with Horatia, who was laughing and saying,
&lsquo;I found this child wandering about the park, and the
little pussycat won&rsquo;t tell where she has been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poaching, of course,&rsquo; responded Charles;
&lsquo;it is what pussycats always do till they get shot by the
keepers.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Et c&aelig;tera</i>, <i>et c&aelig;tera</i>, <i>et
c&aelig;tera</i>.&nbsp; Lucilla was among all the young people,
in the full tide of fun, nonsense, banter, and repartee of a
style new to her, but in which she was formed to excel, and there
was such a black look when Honor summoned her after the meal, as
impressed the awkwardness of enforcing authority among nearer
relations; but it was in vain, she was carried off to the
dressing-room, and reminded of the bargain for two hours&rsquo;
occupation.&nbsp; She murmured something about Owen going out as
he liked.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&lsquo;He came to me before breakfast; besides, he is a
boy.&nbsp; What made you go out in that strange
manner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, but Honor had learnt by experience that
to insist was apt to end in obtaining nothing but a collision of
wills, and she merely put out the Prayer Books for the
morning&rsquo;s reading of the Psalms.&nbsp; By the time it was
over, Lucilla&rsquo;s fit of temper had past, and she leant back
in her chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you listening to,
Lucy?&rsquo; said Honor, seeing her fixed eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The river,&rsquo; said Lucilla, pausing with a
satisfied look to attend to the deep regular rush.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t think before what it was that always seemed to be
wanting, and now I know.&nbsp; It came to me when I went to bed;
it was so nice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The river voice!&nbsp; Yes; it must be one of your
oldest friends,&rsquo; said Honora, gratified at the
softening.&nbsp; &lsquo;So that carried you out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it!&nbsp; I went home,&rsquo;
said Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home?&nbsp; To Wrapworth?&nbsp; All alone?&rsquo; cried
Honor, kindly, but aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; again said the
girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;The river noise was so like
everything&mdash;and I knew the way&mdash;and I felt as if I must
go before any one was up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you really went.&nbsp; And what did you
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I got over the palings our own old way, and
there&rsquo;s my throne still in the back of the laurels, and I
popped in on old Madge, and oh! she was so surprised!&nbsp; And
then I came on Mr. Prendergast, and he walked all the way back
with me, till he saw Ratia coming, and then he would not go on
any farther.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, I can&rsquo;t blame you this time.&nbsp;
I am hoping myself to go to Wrapworth with you and
Owen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ratia is going to take me out riding and in the
boat,&rsquo; said Lucy, without a direct answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You like your cousins better than you
expected?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rashe is famous,&rsquo; was the answer, &lsquo;and so
is Uncle Kit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, you noticed the mark on his hand,&rsquo; said
Honora; &lsquo;you do not know the cause?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; Was it a shark or a mad dog?&rsquo; eagerly
asked the child, slightly alarmed by her manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither.&nbsp; But do not you remember his carrying you
into Woolstone-lane?&nbsp; I always believed you did not know
what your little teeth were doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not received as Honora expected.&nbsp; Probably the
scenes of the girl&rsquo;s infancy had brought back associations
more strongly than she was prepared for&mdash;she turned white,
gasped, and vindictively said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora, shocked, had not discovered a reply, when Lucilla,
somewhat confused at the sound of her own words, said, &lsquo;I
know&mdash;not quite that&mdash;he meant the best&mdash;but,
Cousin Honor, it was cruel, it was wicked, to part my father and
me!&nbsp; Father&mdash;oh, the river is going on still, but not
my father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The excitable girl burst into a flood of passionate tears, as
<!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>though the death of her father were more present to her
than ever before; and she had never truly missed him till she was
brought in contact with her old home.&nbsp; The fatigue and
change, the talking evening and restless night, had produced
their effect; her very thoughtlessness and ordinary
<i>insouciance</i> rendered the rush more overwhelming when it
did come, and the weeping was almost hysterical.</p>
<p>It was not a propitious circumstance that Caroline knocked at
the door with some message as to the afternoon&rsquo;s
arrangements.&nbsp; Honor answered at haphazard, standing so as
to intercept the view, but aware that the long-drawn sobs would
be set down to the account of her own tyranny, and nevertheless
resolving the more on enforcing the quiescence, the need of which
was so evident; but the creature was volatile as well as
sensitive, and by the time the door was shut, stood with heaving
breast and undried tears, eagerly demanding whether her cousins
wanted her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Honora, somewhat annoyed at the
sudden transition; &lsquo;it was only to ask if I would
ride.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charles was to bring the pony for me; I must go,&rsquo;
cried Lucy, with an eye like that of a greyhound in the
leash.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; said Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;My dear, you
promised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never promise anything again,&rsquo; was the
pettish murmur.</p>
<p>Poor child, these two morning hours were to her a terrible
penance, day after day.&nbsp; Practically, she might have found
them heavy had they been left to her own disposal, but it was
expecting overmuch from human nature to hope that she would
believe so without experience, and her lessons were a daily
irritation, an apparent act of tyranny, hardening her feelings
against the exactor, at the same time that the influence of
kindred blood drew her closer to her own family, with a revulsion
the stronger from her own former exaggerated dislike.</p>
<p>The nursery at Castle Blanch, and the cousins who domineered
over her as a plaything, had been intolerable to the little
important companion of a grown man, but it was far otherwise to
emerge from the calm seclusion and sober restraints of the Holt
into the gaieties of a large party, to be promoted to young
ladyhood, and treated on equal terms, save for extra petting and
attention.&nbsp; Instead of Robert Fulmort alone, all the
gentlemen in the house gave her flattering notice&mdash;eye, ear,
and helping hand at her disposal, and blunt Uncle Kit himself was
ten times more civil to her than to either of her cousins.&nbsp;
What was the use of trying to disguise from her the witchery of
her piquant prettiness?</p>
<p>Her cousin Horatia had always had a great passion for her as a
beautiful little toy, and her affection, once so trying to its
object, had taken the far more agreeable form of promoting her
pleasures and sympathizing with her vexations.&nbsp; Patronage
from two-and-twenty to fourteen, from a daughter of the house to
a guest, was too natural to offend, and Lucilla requited it with
vehement attachment, running after her at every moment, <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>confiding all her grievances, and being made sensible of
many more.&nbsp; Ratia, always devising delights for her, took
her on the river, rode with her, set her dancing, opened the
world to her, and enjoyed her pleasures, amused by her precocious
vivacity, fostering her sauciness, extolling the wit of her
audacious speeches, and extremely resenting all poor
Honora&rsquo;s attempts to counteract this terrible spoiling, or
to put a check upon undesirable diversions and absolute
pertness.&nbsp; Every conscientious interference on her part was
regarded as duenna-like harshness, and her restrictions as a
grievous yoke, and Lucilla made no secret that it was so,
treating her to almost unvaried ill-humour and murmurs.</p>
<p>Little did Lucilla know, nor even Horatia, how much of the
charms that produced so much effect were due to these very
restraints, nor how the droll sauciness and womanly airs were
enhanced by the simplicity of appearance, which embellished her
far more than the most fashionable air set off her
companions.&nbsp; Once Lucilla had overheard her aunt thus
excusing her short locks and simple dress&mdash;&lsquo;It is Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp; Of course, when so much depends
on her, we must give way.&nbsp; Excellent person, rather
peculiar, but we are under great obligations to her.&nbsp; Very
good property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No wonder that sojourn at Castle Blanch was one of the most
irksome periods of Honora&rsquo;s life, disappointing, fretting,
and tedious.&nbsp; There was a grievous dearth of books and of
reasonable conversation, and both she and Owen were exceedingly
at a loss for occupation, and used to sit in the boat on the
river, and heartily wish themselves at home.&nbsp; He had no
companion of his own age, and was just too young and too
enterprising to be welcome to gentlemen bent more on amusing
themselves than pleasing him.&nbsp; He was roughly admonished
when he spoilt sport or ran into danger; his cousin Charles was
fitfully good-natured, but generally showed that he was in the
way; his uncle Kit was more brief and stern with him than
&lsquo;Sweet Honey&rsquo;s&rsquo; pupil could endure; and Honor
was his only refuge.&nbsp; His dreariness was only complete when
the sedulous civilities of his aunt carried her beyond his
reach.</p>
<p>She could not attain a visit to Wrapworth till the
Sunday.&nbsp; The carriage went in state to the parish church in
the morning, and the music and preaching furnished subjects for
<i>persiflage</i> at luncheon, to her great discomfort, and the
horror of Owen; and she thought she might venture to Wrapworth in
the afternoon.&nbsp; She had a longing for Owen&rsquo;s church,
&lsquo;for auld lang syne&rsquo;&mdash;no more.&nbsp; Even his
bark church in the backwoods could not have rivalled Hiltonbury
and the brass.</p>
<p>Owen, true to his allegiance, joined her in good time, but
reported that his sister was gone on with Ratia.&nbsp; Whereas
Ratia would probably otherwise not have gone to church at all,
Honor was deprived of all satisfaction in her annoyance, and the
compensation of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Owen
over his father&rsquo;s memory was lost by the unwelcome addition
of Captain Charteris.&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>The loss
signified the less as Owen&rsquo;s reminiscences were never
allowed to languish for want of being dug up and revived, but she
could not quite pardon the sailor for the commonplace air his
presence cast over the walk.</p>
<p>The days were gone by when Mr. Sandbrook&rsquo;s pulpit
eloquence had rendered Wrapworth Church a Sunday show to Castle
Blanch.&nbsp; His successor was a cathedral dignitary, so
constantly absent that the former curate, who had been continued
on at Wrapworth, was, in the eyes of every one, the veritable
master.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Prendergast&mdash;whatever were his
qualifications as a preacher&mdash;had always been regarded as a
disappointment; people had felt themselves defrauded when the
sermon fell to his share instead of that of Mr. Sandbrook, and
odious comparison had so much established the opinion of his
deficiencies, that Honora was not surprised to see a large-limbed
and rather quaint-looking man appear in the desk, but the service
was gone through with striking reverence, and the sermon was
excellent, though homely and very plain-spoken.&nbsp; The church
had been cruelly mauled by churchwardens of the last century, and
a few Gothic decorations, intended for the beginning of
restoration, only made it the more incongruous.&nbsp; The east
window, of stained glass, of a quality left far behind by the
advances of the last twenty years, bore an inscription showing
that it was a memorial, and there was a really handsome
font.&nbsp; Honor could trace the late rector&rsquo;s
predilections in a manner that carried her back twenty years, and
showed her, almost to her amusement, how her own notions and
sympathies had been carried onwards with the current of the world
around her.</p>
<p>On coming out, she found that there might have been more
kindness in Captain Charteris than she had suspected, for he kept
Horatia near him, and waited for the curate, so as to leave her
at liberty and unobserved.&nbsp; Her first object was that Owen
should see his mother&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; It was beside the
parsonage path, a flat stone, fenced by a low iron border,
enclosing likewise a small flower-bed, weedy, ruinous, and
forlorn.&nbsp; A floriated cross, filled up with green lichen,
was engraven above the name.</p>

87</span>How like it was to poor Owen! that necessity of
expression, and the visible presage of weakening health so surely
fulfilled!&nbsp; And his Lucilla!&nbsp; It was a melancholy work
to have brought home a missionary, and secularized a parish
priest!&nbsp; &lsquo;Not a generous reflection,&rsquo; thought
Honora, &lsquo;at a rival&rsquo;s grave,&rsquo; and she turned to
the boy, who had stooped to pull at some of the bits of
groundsel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we come here in the early morning, and set it to
rights?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot it was Sunday,&rsquo; said Owen, hastily
throwing down the weed he had plucked up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were doing no harm, my dear; but we will not leave
it in this state.&nbsp; Will you come with us, Lucy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla had escaped, and was standing aloof at the end of the
path, and when her brother went towards her, she turned away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Lucy,&rsquo; he entreated, &lsquo;come into the
garden with us.&nbsp; We want you to tell us the old
places.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not coming,&rsquo; was all her answer, and
she ran back to the party who stood by the church door, and began
to chatter to Mr. Prendergast, over whom she had domineered even
before she could speak plain.&nbsp; A silent, shy man, wrapped up
in his duties, he was mortally afraid of the Castle Blanch young
ladies, and stood ill at ease, talked down by Miss Horatia
Charteris, but his eye lighted into a smile as the fairy
plaything of past years danced up to him, and began her merry
chatter, asking after every one in the parish, and showing a
perfect memory of names and faces such as amazed him, in a child
so young as she had been at the time when she had left the
parish.&nbsp; Honora and Owen meantime were retracing
recollections in the rectory garden, eking out the boy&rsquo;s
four years old memories with imaginations and moralizings,
pondering over the border whence Owen declared he had gathered
snowdrops for his mother&rsquo;s coffin; and the noble plane tree
by the water-side, sacred to the memory of Bible stories told by
his father in the summer evenings&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That tree!&rsquo; laughed Lucilla, when he told her
that night as they walked up-stairs to bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody
could sit there because of the mosquitoes.&nbsp; And I should
like to see the snowdrops you found in November!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know there were some white flowers.&nbsp; Were they
lilies of the valley for little Mary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will do just as well,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp; She
knew that she could bring either scene before her mind with vivid
distinctness, but shrinking from the pain almost with horror, she
only said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you aren&rsquo;t a Roman
Catholic, Owen; you would soon find a hole in a rock, and say it
was where a saint, with his head under his arm, had made a
footmark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very irreverent, Lucy, and very cross
besides.&nbsp; If you would not come and tell us, what could we
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t care for dear papa and mamma,
I do,&rsquo; said Owen, the tears coming into his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to rake it up to please
Honora,&rsquo; returned his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you like to
go and poke with her over places where things never happened, you
may, but she shan&rsquo;t meddle with my real things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very unkind,&rsquo; was the next accusation
from Owen, much grieved and distressed, &lsquo;when she is so
good and dear, and was so fond of our dear father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Lucilla, in a tone he did not
understand; then, with an air of eldership, ill assorting with
their respective sizes, &lsquo;You are a mere child.&nbsp; It is
all very well for you, and you are very welcome to your Sweet
Honey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen insisted on hearing her meaning, and on her refusal to
explain, used his superior strength to put her to sufficient
torture to elicit an answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,
Owen!&nbsp; Let go!&nbsp; There, then!&nbsp; Why, she was in love
with our father, and nearly died of it when he married; and Rashe
says of course she bullies me for being like my
mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She never bullies you,&rsquo; cried Owen, indignantly;
&lsquo;she&rsquo;s much kinder to you than you deserve, and I
hate Ratia for putting it into your head, and teaching you such
nasty man&rsquo;s words about my own Honor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ll never be a man while you are under
her.&nbsp; She only wants to keep us a couple of babies for
ever&mdash;sending us to bed, and making such a figure of
me;&rsquo; and Lucy relieved her feelings by five perpendicular
leaps into the air, like an India-rubber ball, her hair flying
out, and her eyes flashing.</p>
<p>Owen was not much astonished, for Lucy&rsquo;s furies often
worked off in this fashion; but he was very angry on
Honor&rsquo;s account, loving her thoroughly, and perceiving no
offence in her affection for his father; and the conversation
assumed a highly quarrelsome character.&nbsp; It was much to the
credit of masculine discretion that he refrained from reporting
it when he joined Honora in the morning&rsquo;s walk to Wrapworth
churchyard.&nbsp; Behold! some one was beforehand with
them&mdash;even Lucilla and the curate!</p>
<p>The wearisome visit was drawing to a close when Captain
Charteris began&mdash;&lsquo;Well, Miss Charlecote, have you
thought over my proposal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To take Owen to sea?&nbsp; Indeed, I hoped you were
convinced that it would never answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So far from being so, that I see it is his best
chance.&nbsp; He will do no good till the priggishness is knocked
out of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor would not trust herself to answer.&nbsp; Any accusation
but this might have been borne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the captain, in a tone still
more provoking, it was so like hushing a petulant child,
&lsquo;we know how kind you were, and that you meant everything
good; but it is not in the nature of things that a lad alone with
women should not <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>be cock of the walk, and nothing
cures that like a month on board.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will go to school,&rsquo; said Honor, convinced all
this was prejudice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and come home in the holidays, lording it as if he
were master and more, like the son and heir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Captain Charteris, you are quite mistaken; I
have never allowed Owen to think himself in that position.&nbsp;
He knows perfectly well that there are nearer claims upon me, and
that Hiltonbury can never belong to him.&nbsp; I have always
rejoiced that it should be so.&nbsp; I should not like to have
the least suspicion that there could be self-interest in his
affection for me in the time to come; and I think it presumptuous
to interfere with the course of Providence in the matter of
inheritances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; said the captain, who
had looked at her with somewhat of a pitying smile, instead of
attending to her last words, &lsquo;do you imagine that you know
that boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know who else should,&rsquo; she answered,
quivering between a disposition to tears at the harshness, and to
laughter at the assumption of the stranger uncle to see farther
than herself into her darling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; quoth the sailor,
&lsquo;slippery&mdash;slippery fellows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not understand you.&nbsp; You do not mean to imply
that I have not his perfect confidence, or do you think I have
managed him wrongly?&nbsp; If you do, pray tell me at once.&nbsp;
I dare say I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say so,&rsquo; said Captain
Charteris.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are an excellent good woman, Miss
Charlecote, and the best friend the poor things have had in the
world; and you have taught them more good than I could, I&rsquo;m
sure; but I never yet saw a woman who could be up to a boy, any
more than she could sail a ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely not,&rsquo; said Honor, with a lame attempt
at a good-humoured laugh; &lsquo;but I should be very glad to
know whether you are speaking from general experience of woman
and boy, or from individual observation of the case in
point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The captain made a very odd, incomprehensible little bow; and
after a moment&rsquo;s thought, said, &lsquo;Plainly speaking,
then, I don&rsquo;t think you do get to the bottom of that lad;
but there&rsquo;s no telling, and I never had any turn for those
smooth chaps.&nbsp; If a fellow begins by being over-precise in
what is of no consequence, ten to one but he ends by being
reckless in all the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This last speech entirely reassured Honor, by proving to her
that the captain was entirely actuated by prejudice against his
nephew&rsquo;s gentle and courteous manners and her own religious
views.&nbsp; He did not believe in the possibility of the success
of such an education, and therefore was of course insensible to
Owen&rsquo;s manifold excellences.</p>
<p>Thenceforth she indignantly avoided the subject, and made no
attempt to discover whether the captain&rsquo;s eye, practised in
midshipmen, had made any positive observations on which to <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>found his dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Wounded by his want of
gratitude, and still more hurt by his unkind judgment of her
beloved pupil, she transferred her consultations to the more
deferential uncle, who was entirely contented with his nephew,
transported with admiration of her management, and ready to make
her a present of him with all his heart.&nbsp; So readily did he
accede to all that she said of schools, that the choice was
virtually left to her.&nbsp; Eton was rejected as a fitter
preparation for the squirearchy than the ministry; Winchester on
account of the distaste between Owen and young Fulmort; and her
decision was fixed in favour of Westminster, partly for his
father&rsquo;s sake, partly on account of the proximity of St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s&mdash;such an infinite advantage, as Mr.
Charteris observed.</p>
<p>The sailor declared that he knew nothing of schools, and would
take no part in the discussion.&nbsp; There had, in truth, been
high words between the brothers, each accusing the other of going
the way to ruin their nephew, ending by the
captain&rsquo;s&rsquo; exclaiming, &lsquo;Well, I wash my hands
of it!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t flatter a foolish woman into spoiling
poor Lucilla&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; If I am not to do what I think
right by him, I shall get out of sight of it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His prospects, Kit; how often I have told you it is our
duty to consider his prospects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hang his prospects!&nbsp; A handsome heiress under
forty!&nbsp; How can you be such an ass, Charles?&nbsp; He ought
to be able to make an independent fortune before he could stand
in her shoes, if he were ever to do so, which she declares he
never will.&nbsp; Yes, you may look knowing if you will, but she
is no such fool in some things; and depend upon it she will make
a principle of leaving her property in the right channel; and be
that as it may, I warn you that you can&rsquo;t do this lad a
worse mischief than by putting any such notion into his head, if
it be not there already.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a more
deplorable condition in the world than to be always dangling
after an estate, never knowing if it is to be your own or not,
and most likely to be disappointed at last; and, to do Miss
Charlecote justice, she is perfectly aware of that; and it will
not be her fault if he have any false expectations!&nbsp; So, if
you feed him with them, it will all be your fault; and
that&rsquo;s the last I mean to say about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Captain Charteris was not aware of a colloquy in which Owen
had a share.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This lucky fellow,&rsquo; said the young
Life-guardsman, &lsquo;he is as good as an eldest
son&mdash;famous shooting county&mdash;capital, well-timbered
estate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Charles,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;my cousin Honor
always says I am nothing like an eldest son, for there are nearer
relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh ha!&rsquo; said Charles, with a wink of superior
wisdom, &lsquo;we understand that.&nbsp; She knows how to keep
you on your good behaviour.&nbsp; Why, but for cutting you out, I
would even make up to her myself&mdash;fine-looking, comely
woman, and well-preserved&mdash;and only the women quarrel with
that splendid hair.&nbsp; Never <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>mind, my boy,
I don&rsquo;t mean it.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t stand in your
light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if Honor would have <i>you</i>!&rsquo; cried Owen,
in fierce scorn.&nbsp; Charles Charteris and his companions, with
loud laughter, insisted on the reasons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; cried the boy, with flashing looks,
&lsquo;she would not be ridiculous; and you
are&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused, but they held him fast, and
insisted on hearing what Charles was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a good Churchman,&rsquo; he finally
pronounced.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, you may laugh at me, but Honor
shan&rsquo;t be laughed at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Possibly Owen&rsquo;s views at present were that &lsquo;not to
be a good Churchman&rsquo; was synonymous with all imaginable
evil, and that he had put it in a delicate manner.&nbsp; Whether
he heard the last of it for the rest of his visit may be
imagined.&nbsp; And, poor boy, though he was strong and spirited
enough with his own contemporaries, there was no dealing with the
full-fledged soldier.&nbsp; Nor, when conversation turned to what
&lsquo;we&rsquo; did at Hiltonbury, was it possible always to
disclaim standing in the same relation to the Holt as did Charles
to Castle Blanch; nay, a certain importance seemed to attach to
such an assumption of dignity, of which Owen was not loth to
avail himself in his disregarded condition.</p>

92</span>PART II</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<blockquote><p>We hold our greyhound in our hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our falcon on our glove;<br />
But where shall we find leash or band<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For dame that loves to rove?&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Scott</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A June evening shed a slanting light over the greensward of
Hiltonbury Holt, and made the western windows glisten like
diamonds, as Honora Charlecote slowly walked homewards to her
solitary evening meal, alone, except for the nearly blind old
pointer who laid his grizzled muzzle upon her knees, gazing
wistfully into her face, as seating herself upon the step of the
sun-dial, she fondled his smooth, depressed black head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Ponto!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we are grown old
together.&nbsp; Our young ones are all gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grown old?&nbsp; Less old in proportion than Ponto&mdash;still
in full vigour of mind and body, but old in disenchantment, and
not without the traces of her forty-seven years.&nbsp; The auburn
hair was still in rich masses of curl; only on close inspection
were silver threads to be detected; the cheek was paler, the brow
worn, and the gravely handsome dress was chosen to suit the
representative of the Charlecotes, not with regard to lingering
youthfulness.&nbsp; The slow movement, subdued tone, and downcast
eye, had an air of habitual dejection and patience, as though
disappointment had gone deeper, or solitude were telling more on
the spirits, than any past blow had done.</p>
<p>She saw the preparations for her tea going on within the
window, but ere going indoors, she took out and re-read two
letters.</p>
<p>The first was in the irregular decided characters affected by
young ladies in the reaction from their grandmothers&rsquo;
pointed illegibilities, and bore a scroll at the top, with the
word &lsquo;Cilly,&rsquo; in old English letters of bright
blue.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Lowndes Square,
June 14th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Honor</span>,&mdash;Many
thanks for wishing for your will-o&rsquo;-th&rsquo;-wisp again,
but it is going to dance off in another direction.&nbsp; Rashe
and I are bound to the west of Ireland, as soon as
Charles&rsquo;s inauguration is over at Castle Blanch; an odd
jumble of festivities it is to be, but Lolly is just cockney
enough to be determinedly rural, and there&rsquo;s sure to be
some fun to be got out of it; besides, I am pacified by having my
special darling, Edna Murrell, the lovely schoolmistress at
Wrapworth, to sing to them.&nbsp; How Mr. Calthorp will admire
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>her, as long as he thinks she is Italian!&nbsp; It will
be hard if I can&rsquo;t get a rise out of some of them!&nbsp;
This being the case, I have not a moment for coming home; but I
send some contributions for the prize-giving, some stunning
articles from the Lowther Arcade.&nbsp; The gutta-percha face is
for Billy Harrison, <i>whether in disgrace or not</i>.&nbsp; He
deserves compensation for his many weary hours of Sunday School,
and it may suggest a new art for beguiling the time.&nbsp;
<i>Mind</i> you tell him it is from me, with my love; and bestow
the rest on all the chief reprobates.&nbsp; I wish I could see
them; but you have no loss, you know how unedifying I am.&nbsp;
Kiss Ponto for me, and ask Robin for his commands to
Connaught.&nbsp; I know his sulkiness will transpire through
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Love to that dear little Cinderella, and tell
her mamma and Juliana, that if she does not come out this winter,
Mrs. Fulmort shall have no peace and Juliana no partners.&nbsp;
Please to look in my room for my great nailed boots and
hedging-gloves, also for the pig&rsquo;s wool in the left-hand
drawer of the cabinet, and send them to me before the end of next
week.&nbsp; Owen would give his ears to come with us, but
gentlemen would only obstruct Irish chivalry; I am only afraid
there is no hope of a faction fight.&nbsp; Mr. Saville called
yesterday, so I made him dine here, and sung him into
raptures.&nbsp; What a dear old Don he is!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your affectionate
cousin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Cilly</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second letter stood thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Farrance&rsquo;s
Hotel, June 14th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear miss
Charlecote</span>,&mdash;I have seen Lawrence on your business,
and he will prepare the leases for your signature.&nbsp; He
suggests that it might be more satisfactory to wait, in case you
should be coming to town, so that you might have a personal
meeting with the parties; but this will be for you to
determine.&nbsp; I came up from --- College on Wednesday, having
much enjoyed my visit.&nbsp; Oxford is in many respects a changed
place, but as long as our old Head remains to us, I am sure of a
gratifying welcome, and I saw many old friends.&nbsp; I exchanged
cards with Owen Sandbrook, but only saw him as we met in the
street, and a very fine-looking youth he is, a perfect Hercules,
and the champion of his college in all feats of strength; likely,
too, to stand well in the class list.&nbsp; His costume was not
what we should once have considered academical; but his is a
daring set, intellectual as well as bodily, and the clever young
men of the present day are not what they were in my time.&nbsp;
It is gratifying to hear how warmly and affectionately he talks
of you.&nbsp; I do not know how far you have undertaken the
supplies, but I give you a hint that a warning on that subject
might not be inappropriate, unless they have come into some great
accession of fortune on their uncle&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; I
ventured to call upon the young lady in Lowndes Square, and was
most graciously received, and asked <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>to dinner by
the young Mrs. Charteris.&nbsp; It was a most
<i>r&eacute;cherch&eacute;</i> dinner in the new Italian fashion,
which does not quite approve itself to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Regardless of expense,&rdquo; seems to be the family
motto.&nbsp; Your pupil sings better than ever, and knew how to
keep her hold of my heart, though I suspected her of patronizing
the old parson to pique her more brilliant admirers, whom she
possesses in plenty; and no wonder, for she is pretty enough to
turn any man&rsquo;s head and shows to great advantage beside her
cousin, Miss Charteris.&nbsp; I hope you will be able to prevent
the cousins from really undertaking the wild plan of travelling
alone in Ireland, for the sake, they say, of
salmon-fishing.&nbsp; I should have thought them not in earnest,
but girls are as much altered as boys from the days of my
experience, and brothers, too; for Mr. Charteris seemed to view
the scheme very coolly; but, as I told my friend Lucilla, I hope
you will bring her to reason.&nbsp; I hope your hay-crop promises
favourably.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Yours
sincerely,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">W.
Saville</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No wonder that these letters made loneliness more lonely!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that Horatia!&rsquo; exclaimed she, almost
aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, that Captain Charteris were
available!&nbsp; No one else ever had any real power with
Lucy!&nbsp; It was an unlucky day when he saw that colonial young
lady, and settled down in Vancouver&rsquo;s Island!&nbsp; And yet
how I used to wish him away, with the surly independence he was
always infusing into Owen.&nbsp; Wanting to take him out there,
indeed!&nbsp; And yet, and yet&mdash;I sometimes doubt whether I
did right to set my personal influence over my dear affectionate
boy so much in opposition to his uncle&mdash;Mr. Charteris was on
my side, though!&nbsp; And I always took care to have it clearly
understood that it was his education alone that I
undertook.&nbsp; What can Mr. Saville mean?&mdash;The
supplies?&nbsp; Owen knows what he has to trust to, but I can
talk to him.&nbsp; A daring set!&mdash;Yes, everything appears
daring to an old-world man like Mr. Saville.&nbsp; I am sure of
my Owen; with our happy home Sundays.&nbsp; I know I am his Sweet
Honey still.&nbsp; And yet&rsquo;&mdash;then hastily turning from
that dubious &lsquo;and yet&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Owen is the only
chance for his sister.&nbsp; She does care for him; and he will
view this mad scheme in the right light.&nbsp; Shall I meet him
at the beginning of the vacation, and see what he can do with
Lucy?&nbsp; Mr. Saville thinks I ought to be in London, and I
think I might be useful to the Parsonses.&nbsp; I suppose I must;
but it <i>is</i> a heart-ache to be at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
One is used to it here; and there are the poor people, and the
farm, and the garden&mdash;yes, and those dear
nightingales&mdash;and you, poor Ponto!&nbsp; One is used to it
here, but St. Wulstan&rsquo;s is a fresh pain, and so is coming
back.&nbsp; But, if it be in the way of right, and to save poor
Lucy, it must be, and it is what life is made of.&nbsp; It is a
&ldquo;following of the funeral&rdquo; of the hopes that sprang
up after my spring-time.&nbsp; Is it my chastisement, or is it my
training?&nbsp; Alas! maybe I took those children more <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>for
<i>myself</i> than for duty&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; May it all be for
their true good in the end, whatever it may be with me.&nbsp; And
now I <i>will</i> not dream.&nbsp; It is of no use save to
unnerve me.&nbsp; Let me go to my book.&nbsp; It must be a story
to-night.&nbsp; I cannot fix my attention yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she rose, however, her face brightened at the sight of two
advancing figures, and she went forward to meet them.</p>
<p>One was a long, loosely-limbed youth of two-and-twenty, with
broad shoulders, a heavy overhanging brow, dark gray serious
eyes, and a mouth scarcely curved, and so fast shut as to
disclose hardly any lip.&nbsp; The hair was dark and lank; the
air was of ungainly force, that had not yet found its purpose,
and therefore was not at ease; and but for the educated cast of
countenance he would have had a peasant look, in the brown,
homely undress garb, which to most youths of his age would have
been becoming.</p>
<p>With him was a girl, tall, slim, and lightly made, though of
nicely rounded figure.&nbsp; In height she looked like seventeen,
but her dress was more childish than usual at that age; and the
contour of her smooth cheeks and short rounded chin, her long
neck, her happy blue eyes, fully opened like those of a child,
her fair rosy skin and fresh simple air, might almost have
belonged to seven years old: and there was all the earnestness,
innocence, and careless ease of childhood in her movements and
gestures, as she sprang forward to meet Miss Charlecote,
exclaiming, &lsquo;Robin said I might come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And very right of him.&nbsp; You are both come to
tea?&rsquo; she added, in affirmative interrogation, as she shook
hands with the young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;at least I
only brought Ph&oelig;be, having rescued her from Miss
Fennimore&rsquo;s clutches.&nbsp; I must be at dinner.&nbsp; But
I will come again for her.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he yawned
wearily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will drive her back; you are tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;At least the walk is
one of the few tolerable things there is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come
as soon as I can escape, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Past seven&mdash;I
must go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you stay?&nbsp; I could find some food for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; he still said; &lsquo;I do not
know whether Mervyn will come home, and there must not be too
many empty chairs.&nbsp; Good-bye!&rsquo; and he walked off with
long strides, but with stooping shoulders, and an air of
dejection almost amounting to discontent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Robin!&rsquo; said Honora, &lsquo;I wish he could
have stayed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He would have liked it very much,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, casting wistful glances toward him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a pity he did not give notice of his intentions at
home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He never will.&nbsp; He particularly
dislikes&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; as Phoebe paused and coloured.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&lsquo;Saying anything to anybody,&rsquo; she answered
with a little smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;He cannot endure
remarks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a very sober old body for a visit to me to be the
occasion of remarks!&rsquo; said Honor, laughing more merrily
than perhaps Robert himself could have done; but Ph&oelig;be
answered with grave, straightforward sincerity, &lsquo;Yes, but
he did not know if Lucy might not be come home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora sighed, but playfully said, &lsquo;In which case he
would have stayed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the still grave girl, &lsquo;he would
have been still less likely to do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! the remarks would have been more pointed!&nbsp; But
he has brought you at any rate, and that is something!&nbsp; How
did he achieve it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fennimore is really quite ready to be kind,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be, earnestly, with an air of defence,
&lsquo;whenever we have finished all that we have to
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when is that?&rsquo; asked Honor, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now for once,&rsquo; answered Ph&oelig;be, with a
bright arch look.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I sometimes can; and so does
Bertha when she tries; and, indeed, Miss Charlecote, I do like
Miss Fennimore; she never is hard upon poor Maria.&nbsp; No
governess we ever had made her cry so seldom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote only said it was a comfort.&nbsp; Within
herself she hoped that, for Maria&rsquo;s peace and that of all
concerned, her deficiency might become an acknowledged
fact.&nbsp; She saw that the sparing Maria&rsquo;s tears was such
a boon to Ph&oelig;be as to make her forgive all overtasking of
herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you get on better,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much better than Robin chooses to believe we do,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be, smiling; &lsquo;perhaps it seemed hard at
first, but it is comfortable to be made to do everything
thoroughly, and to be shown a better best than we had ever
thought of.&nbsp; I think it ought to be a help in doing the duty
of all one&rsquo;s life in a thorough way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All that thou hast to do,&rsquo; said Honor, smiling,
&lsquo;the week-day side of the fourth commandment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that is just the reason why I like it,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, with bright gladness in her countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is that the motive Miss Fennimore puts before
you?&rsquo; said Honor, a little ironically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does not say so,&rsquo; answered Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She says that she never interferes with her pupils&rsquo;
religious tenets.&nbsp; But, indeed, I do not think she teaches
us anything wrong, and there is always Robert to ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This passed as the two ladies were entering the house and
preparing for the evening meal.&nbsp; The table was placed in the
bay of the open window, and looked very inviting, the little
silver tea-pot steaming beside the two quaint china cups, the
small crisp twists of bread, the butter cool in ice-plant leaves,
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>and some fresh fruit blushing in a pretty basket.&nbsp;
The Holt was a region of Paradise to Ph&oelig;be Fulmort; and
glee shone upon her sweet face, though it was very quiet
enjoyment, as the summer breeze played softly round her cheeks
and danced with a merry little spiral that had detached itself
from her glossy folds of light hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How delicious!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;How sweet
the honeysuckle is, dear old thing!&nbsp; You say you have known
it all your life, and yet it is fresh as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a little like you, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said
Honor, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! because it is not exactly a pretty
flower?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly; and I could tell you of a few other likenesses,
such as your being Robert&rsquo;s woodbine, yet with a sort of
clinging freedom.&nbsp; Yes, and for the qualities you share with
the willow, ready to give thanks and live on the least that
Heaven may give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t live on the least that Heaven may
give,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, in such wonder that Honor smiled
at the justice of her simile, without impressing it upon
Ph&oelig;be, only asking&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the French journey fixed upon,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; they start this day fortnight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&mdash;not you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; there would be no room for me,&rsquo; with a small
sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can that be?&nbsp; Who is going?&nbsp; Papa, mamma,
two sisters!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn,&rsquo; added Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;the courier,
and the two maids.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Two</i> maids!&nbsp; Impossible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is always uncomfortable if mamma and my sisters have
only one between them,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, in her tone of
perfect acquiescence and conviction; and as her friend could not
restrain a gesture of indignation, she added
eagerly&mdash;&lsquo;But, indeed, it is not only for that reason,
but Miss Fennimore says I am not formed enough to profit by
foreign travel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She wants you to finish Smith&rsquo;s <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might be a pity to go away and lose so much of her
teaching,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with persevering
contentment.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare say they will go abroad again,
and perhaps I shall never have so much time for learning.&nbsp;
But, Miss Charlecote, is Lucilla coming home for the
Horticultural Show?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid not, my dear.&nbsp; I think I shall go to
London to see about her, among other things.&nbsp; The
Charterises seem to have quite taken possession of her, ever
since she went to be her cousin Caroline&rsquo;s bridesmaid, and
I must try to put in my claim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Robin so much wished to have seen her,&rsquo;
sighed Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;He says he cannot settle to
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without seeing her?&rsquo; said Honor, amused, though
not without pain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;he has thought so
much about Lucilla.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he tells you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; in a voice expressing of course; while the
frank, clear eyes turned full on Miss Charlecote with such honest
seriousness, <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>that she thought Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
charm as a confidante might be this absence of romantic
consciousness; and she knew of old that when Robert wanted her
opinion or counsel, he spared his own embarrassment by seeking it
through his favourite sister.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
influence had done as much for Robert as he had done for
Ph&oelig;be, and Ph&oelig;be had become his medium of
communication with her in all matters of near and delicate
interest.&nbsp; She was not surprised when the maiden
proceeded&mdash;&lsquo;Papa wants Robin to attend to the office
while he is away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Does Robin like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He would not mind it for a time; but papa wants him,
besides, to take to the business in earnest.&nbsp; You know, my
great-uncle, Robert Mervyn, left Robert all his fortune, quite in
his own hands; and papa says that if he were to put that into the
distillery it would do the business great good, and that Robert
would be one of the richest men in England in ten years&rsquo;
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that would be a complete change in his
views,&rsquo; exclaimed Honor, unable to conceal her disapproval
and consternation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; answered Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;and that
is the reason why he wants to see Lucy.&nbsp; She always declared
that she could not bear people in business, and we always thought
of him as likely to be a clergyman; but, on the other hand, she
has become used to London society, and it is only by his joining
in the distillery that he could give her what she is accustomed
to, and that is the reason he is anxious to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So Lucy is to decide his fate,&rsquo; said
Honora.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am almost sorry to hear it.&nbsp; Surely,
he has never spoken to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He never does speak,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with the
calm gravity of simplicity which was like a halo of
dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no need of speaking.&nbsp; Lucilla
knows how he feels as well as she knows that she breathes the
air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And regards it as little, perhaps, thought Honor, sadly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor Robin!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I suppose he had
better get his mind settled; but indeed it is a fearful
responsibility for my poor foolish Lucy&mdash;&rsquo; and but for
the fear of grieving Ph&oelig;be, she would have added, that such
a purpose as that of entering Holy Orders ought not to have been
made dependent upon the fancy of a girl.&nbsp; Possibly her
expression betrayed her sentiments, for Ph&oelig;be
answered&mdash;&lsquo;There can be no doubt that Lucy will set
him at rest.&nbsp; I am certain that she would be shocked at the
notion that her tastes were making him doubt whether to be a
clergyman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so!&nbsp; I trust so!&rsquo; said Honora, almost
mournfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be very good for her, as I
believe it is for every woman of any soundness, to be taught that
her follies tell upon man&rsquo;s greater aims and
purposes.&nbsp; It may be wholesome for her and a check,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be wondered that her friend paused and looked so
sad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Honora, after a
moment&rsquo;s silence, speaking fervently, &lsquo;if you can in
any way do so, warn your brother against making an idol!&nbsp;
Let nothing come between him and <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the direct
devotion of will and affection to the Higher Service.&nbsp; If he
decide on the one or the other, let it be from duty, not with
respect to anything else.&nbsp; I do not suppose it is of any use
to warn him,&rsquo; she added, with the tears in her eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Every one sets the whole soul upon some one object, not
the right, and then comes the shipwreck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Robin!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is
so good!&nbsp; I am sure he always thinks first of what is
right.&nbsp; But I think I see what you mean.&nbsp; If he
undertake the business, it should be as a matter of obedience to
papa, not to keep Lucy in the great world.&nbsp; And, indeed, I
do not think my father does care much, only he would like the
additional capital; and Robert is so much more steady than
Mervyn, that he would be more useful.&nbsp; Perhaps it would make
him more important at home; no one there has any interest in
common with him; and I think that moves him a little; but, after
all, those do not seem reasons for not giving himself to
God&rsquo;s service,&rsquo; she finished, reverently and
considerately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed!&rsquo; cried Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you think he ought not to change his
mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have thought so all along,&rsquo; smiled Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not like it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;but
I did not know if I were right.&nbsp; I did tell him that I
really believed Lucy would think the more highly of him if he
settled for himself without reference to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did!&nbsp; You were a capital little adviser,
Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; A woman worthy to be loved at all had always
rather be set second instead of first:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br />
Loved I not honour more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the true spirit, and I am glad you judged Lucy to be
capable of it.&nbsp; Keep your brother up to that, and all may be
well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe Robert knows it all the time,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;He always is right at the bottom; but
his feelings get so much tried that he does not know how to bear
it!&nbsp; I hope Lucy will be kind to him if they meet in London,
for he has been so much harassed that he wants some comfort from
her.&nbsp; If she would only be in earnest!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he go to London, at all events?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has promised to attend to the office in Great
Whittington-street for a month, by way of experiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; cried
Honora, radiantly, &lsquo;you and I will go too!&nbsp; You shall
come with me to Woolstone-lane, and Robin shall be with us every
day; and we will try and make this silly Lucy into a rational
being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Miss Charlecote, thank you&mdash;thank
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The quiet girl&rsquo;s face and neck were all
one crimson glow of delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you can sleep in a little brown cupboard of a room
in the very core of the City&rsquo;s heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&lsquo;Delightful!&nbsp; I have so wished to see that
house.&nbsp; Owen has told me such things about it.&nbsp; Oh,
thank you, Miss Charlecote!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever seen anything in London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&nbsp; We hardly ever go with the rest; and if we
do, we only walk in the square.&nbsp; What a holiday it will
be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will see everything, and do it justice.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll get an order for the print-room at the British
Museum.&nbsp; I day say Robin never saw it either; and what a
treat it will be to take you to the Egyptian Gallery!&rsquo;
cried Honora, excited into looking at the expedition in the light
of a party of pleasure, as she saw happiness beaming in the young
face opposite.</p>
<p>They built up their schemes in the open window, pausing to
listen to the nightingales, who, having ceased for two hours,
apparently for supper, were now in full song, echoing each other
in all the woods of Hiltonbury, casting over it a network of
sweet melody.&nbsp; Honora was inclined to regret leaving them in
their glory; but Ph&oelig;be, with the world before her, was too
honest to profess poetry which she did not feel.&nbsp;
Nightingales were all very well in their place, but the first
real sight of London was more.</p>
<p>The lamp came in, and Ph&oelig;be held out her hands for
something to do, and was instantly provided with a child&rsquo;s
frock, while Miss Charlecote read to her one of
Fouqu&eacute;&rsquo;s shorter tales by way of supplying the
element of chivalrous imagination which was wanting in the
Beauchamp system of education.</p>
<p>So warm was the evening, that the window remained open, until
Ponto erected his crest as a footfall came steadily along, nearer
and nearer.&nbsp; Uplifting one of his pendant lips, he gave a
low growl through his blunted teeth, and listened again; but
apparently satisfied that the step was familiar, he replaced his
head on his crossed paws, and presently Robert Fulmort&rsquo;s
head and the upper part of his person, in correct evening
costume, were thrust in at the window, the moonlight making his
face look very white, as he said, &lsquo;Come, Ph&oelig;be, make
haste; it is very late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, springing up; &lsquo;I
thought I had only been here an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three, at least,&rsquo; said Robert, yawning;
&lsquo;six by my feelings.&nbsp; I could not get away, for Mr.
Crabbe stayed to dinner; Mervyn absented himself, and my father
went to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robin, only think, Miss Charlecote is so kind as to say
she will take me to London!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very kind,&rsquo; said Robert, warmly, his weary
face and voice suddenly relieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be delighted to have a companion,&rsquo; said
Honora; &lsquo;and I reckon upon you too, Robin, whenever you can
spare time from your work.&nbsp; Come in, and let us talk it
over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The dragon will fall on
Ph&oelig;be if I keep her out too late.&nbsp; Be quick,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While his sister went to fetch her hat, he put his elbows on
the <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>sill, and leaning into the room,
said, &lsquo;Thank you again; it will be a wonderful treat to
her, and she has never had one in her life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was in hopes she would have gone to
Germany.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is perfectly abominable!&nbsp; It is all the
others&rsquo; doing!&nbsp; They know no one would look at them a
second time if anything so much younger and pleasanter was
by!&nbsp; They think her coming out would make them look
older.&nbsp; I know it would make them look crosser.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laughing was the only way to treat this tirade, knowing, as
Honor did, that there was but too much truth in it.&nbsp; She
said, however, &lsquo;Yet one could hardly wish Ph&oelig;be other
than she is.&nbsp; The rosebud keeps its charm longer in the
shade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like justice,&rsquo; quoth Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;I really think that
she is much benefited by this formidable governess.&nbsp;
Accuracy and solidity and clearness of head are worth
cultivating.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nasty latitudinarian piece of machinery,&rsquo; said
Robert, with his fingers over his mouth, like a sulky child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe so; but you guard Ph&oelig;be, and she guards
Bertha; and whatever your sense of injustice may be, this surely
is a better school for her than gaieties as yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be a more intolerable shame than ever if they
will not let her go with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too intolerable to be expected,&rsquo; smiled
Honora.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall come and beg for her to-morrow, and
I do not believe I shall be disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with the security of one not in the habit of having
her patronage obstructed by relations; and Ph&oelig;be coming
down with renewed thanks, the brother and sister started on their
way home in the moonlight&mdash;the one plodding on moodily, the
other, unable to repress her glee, bounding on in a succession of
little skips, and pirouetting round to clap her hands, and
exclaim, &lsquo;Oh! Robin, is it not delightful?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they will let you go,&rsquo; said he, too desponding
for hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think they will not?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
with slower and graver steps.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you really think
so?&nbsp; But no!&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t lead to coming out; and I
know they like me to be happy when it interferes with
nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great generosity,&rsquo; said Robert, dryly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but, Robin, you know elder ones come
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A truth we are not likely to forget,&rsquo; said
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish my uncle had been sensible of
it.&nbsp; That legacy of his stands between Mervyn and me, and
will never do me any good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;Mervyn has always been completely the eldest
son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; returned Robert, &lsquo;and with the tastes
of an eldest son.&nbsp; His allowance does not suffice for them,
and he does not like to see me independent.&nbsp; If my uncle had
only been contented to let us share and share alike, then my
father would have had <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>no interest in drawing me into the
precious gin and brandy manufacture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not think he meant to make it a matter of
obedience,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he could hardly do that after the way he has
brought me up, and what we have been taught all our lives about
liberty of the individual, absence of control, and the like
jargon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are not obliged?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made no answer, and they walked on in silence across the
silvery lawn, the maythorns shining out like flaked towers of
snow in the moonlight, and casting abyss-like shadows, the sky of
the most deep and intense blue, and the carols of the
nightingales ringing around them.&nbsp; Robert paused when he had
passed through the gate leading into the dark path down-hill
through the wood, and setting his elbows on it, leant over it,
and looked back at the still and beautiful scene, in all the
white mystery of moonlight, enhanced by the white-blossomed trees
and the soft outlines of slumbering sheep.&nbsp; One of the
birds, in a bush close to them, began prolonging its drawn-in
notes in a continuous prelude, then breaking forth into a varied
complex warbling, so wondrous that there was no moving till the
creature paused.</p>
<p>It seemed to have been a song of peace to Robert, for he gave
a long but much softer sigh, and pushed back his hat, saying,
&lsquo;All good things dwell on the Holt side of the
boundary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sort of Sunday world,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; after this wood one is in another
atmosphere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet you have carried your cares there, poor
Robin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So one does into Sunday, but to get another light
thrown on them.&nbsp; The Holt has been the blessing of my
life&mdash;of both our lives, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She responded with all her heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, it has
made everything happier, at home and everywhere else.&nbsp; I
never can think why Lucilla is not more fond of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are mistaken,&rsquo; exclaimed Robert; &lsquo;she
loves no place so well; but you don&rsquo;t consider what claims
her relations have upon her.&nbsp; That cousin Horatia, to whom
she is so much attached, losing both her parents, how could she
do otherwise than be with her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charteris does not seem to be in great trouble
now,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not consider; you have never seen grief, and you
do not know how much more a sympathizing friend is needed when
the world supposes the sorrow to be over, and ordinary habits to
be resumed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was willing to believe him right, though
considering that Horatia Charteris lived with her brother and his
wife, she could hardly be as lonely as Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall see Lucy in London,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Robert again sighed heavily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then it will be
over,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>&lsquo;Did
you say anything there?&rsquo; he pursued, as they plunged into
the dark shadows of the woodland path, more congenial to the
subject than the light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she thought me a weak, unworthy wretch for ever
dreaming of swerving from my original path.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;not if it were your
duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you, Ph&oelig;be, it is as much my duty to
consult Lucilla&rsquo;s happiness as if any words had passed
between us.&nbsp; I have never pledged myself to take
Orders.&nbsp; It has been only a wish, not a vocation; and if she
have become averse to the prospect of a quiet country life, it
would not be treating her fairly not to give her the choice of
comparative wealth, though procured by means her family might
despise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I knew you would put right and duty first; and I
suppose by doing so you make it certain to end rightly, one way
or other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very few years, and I could realize as much as this
Calthorp, the millionaire, whom they talk of as being so often at
the Charterises.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will not be so,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know what she will say;&rsquo; and as Robert looked
anxiously at her, she continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will say she never dreamt of your being turned from
anything so great by any fancies she has seemed to have.&nbsp;
She will say so more strongly, for you know her father was a
clergyman, and Miss Charlecote brought her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s certainty made Robert catch something of
her hopes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;matters might be
soon settled.&nbsp; This fortune of mine would be no misfortune
then; and probably, Ph&oelig;be, my sisters would have no
objection to your being happy with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as you could get a curacy!&nbsp; Oh, how
delightful! and Maria and Bertha would come too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert held his peace, not certain whether Lucilla would
consider Maria an embellishment to his ideal parsonage; but they
talked on with cheerful schemes while descending through the
wood, unlocking a gate that formed the boundary between the Holt
and the Beauchamp properties, crossing a field or two, and then
coming out into the park.&nbsp; Presently they were in sight of
the house, rising darkly before them, with many lights shining in
the windows behind the blinds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are all gone up-stairs!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
dismayed.&nbsp; &lsquo;How late it must be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a light in the smoking-room,&rsquo; said
Robert; &lsquo;we can get in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; Mervyn may have some one with him.&nbsp;
Come in quietly by the servants&rsquo; entrance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No danger that people would not be on foot there!&nbsp; As the
brother and sister moved along the long stone passage, fringed
with labelled bells, one open door showed two weary maidens <!--
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>still toiling over the plates of the late dinner; and
another, standing ajar, revealed various men-servants regaling
themselves; and words and tones caught Robert&rsquo;s ear making
his brow lower with sudden pain.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was proceeding to mount the stone stairs, when a
rustling and chattering, as of maids descending, caused her and
her brother to stand aside to make way, and down came a pair of
heads and candles together over a green bandbox, and then voices
in vulgar tones half suppressed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
venture it, not with Miss Juliana&mdash;but Miss
Fulmort&mdash;she never looks over her bills, nor knows what is
in her drawers&mdash;I told her it was faded, when she had never
worn it once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And tittering, they passed by the brother and sister, who were
still unseen, but Robert heaved a sigh and murmured,
&lsquo;Miserable work!&rsquo; somewhat to his sister&rsquo;s
surprise, for to her the great ill-regulated household was an
unquestioned institution, and she did not expect him to bestow so
much compassion on Augusta&rsquo;s discarded bonnet.&nbsp; At the
top of the steps they opened a door, and entered a great wide
hall.&nbsp; All was exceedingly still.&nbsp; A gas-light was
burning over the fire-place, but the corners were in gloom, and
the coats and cloaks looked like human figures in the
distance.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be waited while Robert lighted her
candle for her.&nbsp; Albeit she was not nervous, she started
when a door was sharply pushed open, and another figure appeared;
but it was nothing worse than her brother Mervyn, in easy
costume, and redolent of tobacco.</p>
<p>About three years older than Robert, he was more neatly though
not so strongly made, shorter, and with more regular features,
but much less countenance.&nbsp; If the younger brother had a
worn and dejected aspect, the elder, except in moments of
excitement, looked <i>bored</i>.&nbsp; It was as if Robert really
had the advantage of him in knowing what to be out of spirits
about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rsquo; said he, coming
forward, with a sauntering, scuffling movement in his
slippers.&nbsp; &lsquo;You larking, Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; What
next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been drinking tea with Miss Charlecote,&rsquo;
explained Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>Mervyn slightly shrugged his shoulders, murmuring something
about &lsquo;Lively pastime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not fetch her sooner,&rsquo; said Robert,
&lsquo;for my father went to sleep, and no one chose to be at the
pains of entertaining Crabbe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay&mdash;a prevision of his staying to dinner made me
stay and dine with the --th mess.&nbsp; Very sagacious&mdash;eh,
Pheebe?&rsquo; said he, turning, as if he liked to look into her
fresh face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too sagacious,&rsquo; said she, smiling; &lsquo;for you
left him all to Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Manner and look expressed that this was a matter of no
concern, and he said ungraciously: &lsquo;Nobody detained Robert,
it was his own concern.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&lsquo;Respect to my father and his guests,&rsquo; said
Robert, with downright gravity that gave it the effect of a
reproach.</p>
<p>Mervyn only raised his shoulders up to his ears in contempt,
took up his candle, and wished Ph&oelig;be good night.</p>
<p>Poor Mervyn Fulmort!&nbsp; Discontent had been his life-long
comrade.&nbsp; He detested his father&rsquo;s occupation as
galling to family pride, yet was greedy both of the profits and
the management.&nbsp; He hated country business and country life,
yet chafed at not having the control of his mother&rsquo;s
estate, and grumbled at all his father&rsquo;s measures.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What should an old distiller know of landed
property?&rsquo;&nbsp; In fact he saw the same difference between
himself and his father as did the ungracious Plantagenet between
the son of a Count and the son of a King: and for want of
Proven&ccedil;al troubadours with whom to rebel, he supplied
their place by the turf and the billiard-table.&nbsp; At present
he was expiating some heavy debts by a forced residence with his
parents, and unwilling attention to the office, a most
distasteful position, which he never attempted to improve, and
which permitted him both the tedium of idleness and complaints
against all the employment to which he was necessitated.</p>
<p>The ill-managed brothers were just nearly enough of an age for
rivalry, and had never loved one another even as children.&nbsp;
Robert&rsquo;s steadiness had been made a reproach to Mervyn, and
his grave, rather surly character had never been
conciliating.&nbsp; The independence left to the younger brother
by their mother&rsquo;s relative was grudged by the elder as an
injury to himself, and it was one of the misfortunes of Beauchamp
that the two sons had never been upon happy terms together.&nbsp;
Indeed, save that Robert&rsquo;s right principles and silent
habits hindered him from readily giving or taking offence, there
might have been positive outbreaks of a very unbrotherly
nature.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<blockquote><p>Enough of science and of art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close up those barren leaves!<br />
Come forth, and bring with you a heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That watches and receives.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Half-past five, Miss Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you;&rsquo; and before her eyes were open,
Ph&oelig;be was on the floor.</p>
<p>Six was the regulation hour.&nbsp; Systematic education had
discovered that half-an-hour was the maximum allowable for
morning toilette, and at half-past six the young ladies must
present themselves in the school-room.</p>
<p>The Bible, Prayer Book, and &lsquo;Daily Meditations&rsquo;
could have been seldom touched, had not Ph&oelig;be, ever since
Robert had impressed on her the duty of such constant study, made
an arrangement for gaining an extra half-hour.&nbsp; Cold
mornings <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and youthful sleepiness had received
a daily defeat: and, mayhap, it was such a course of victory that
made her frank eyes so blithesome, and her step so free and
light.</p>
<p>That bright scheme, too, shone before her, as such a secret of
glad hope, that, knowing how uncertain were her chances of
pleasure, she prayed that she might not set her heart on
it.&nbsp; It was no trifle to her, and her simple spirit ventured
to lay her wishes before her loving Father in Heaven, and entreat
that she might not be denied, if it were right for her and would
be better for Robert; or, if not, that she might be good under
the disappointment.</p>
<p>Her orisons sent her forth all brightness, with her small head
raised like that of a young fawn, her fresh lips parted by an
incipient smile of hope, and her cheeks in a rosy glow of health,
a very Hebe, as Mr. Saville had once called her.</p>
<p>Such a morning face as hers was not always met by Miss
Fennimore, who, herself able to exist on five hours&rsquo; sleep,
had no mercy on that of her pupils; and she rewarded
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s smiling good-morrow with &lsquo;This is
better than I expected, you returned home so late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert could not come for me early,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you spend the evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote read aloud to me.&nbsp; It was a
delightful German story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote is a very well-informed person, and I
am glad the time was not absolutely lost.&nbsp; I hope you
observed the condensation of the vapours on your way
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert was talking to me, and the nightingales were
singing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, not unkindly,
&lsquo;that you should not cultivate the habit of
observation.&nbsp; Women can seldom theorize, but they should
always observe facts, as these are the very groundwork of
discovery, and such a rare opportunity as a walk at night should
not be neglected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was no use to plead that this was all very well when there
was no brother Robert with his destiny in the scales, so
Ph&oelig;be made a meek assent, and moved to the piano,
suppressing a sigh as Miss Fennimore set off on a domiciliary
visit to the other sisters.</p>
<p>Mr. Fulmort liked his establishment to prove his consequence,
and to the old family mansion of the Mervyns he had added a whole
wing for the educational department.&nbsp; Above, there was a
passage, with pretty little bed-rooms opening from it; below
there were two good-sized rooms, with their own door opening into
the garden.&nbsp; The elder ones had long ago deserted it, and so
completely shut off was it from the rest of the house, that the
governess and her pupils were as secluded as though in a separate
dwelling.&nbsp; The schoolroom was no repulsive-looking abode; it
was furnished almost well enough for a drawing-room; and only the
easels, globes, and desks, the crayon studies on the walls, and a
formidable time-table showed its real destination.</p>
<p>The window looked out into a square parterre, shut in with
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>tall laurel hedges, and filled with the gayest and
sweetest blossoms.&nbsp; It was Mrs. Fulmort&rsquo;s garden for
cut flowers; supplying the bouquets that decked her tables, or
were carried to wither at balls; and there were three long,
narrow beds, that Ph&oelig;be and her younger sisters still
called theirs, and loved with the pride of property; but, indeed,
the bright carpeting of the whole garden was something especially
their own, rejoicing their eyes, and unvalued by the rest of the
house.&nbsp; On the like liberal scale were the salaries of the
educators.&nbsp; Governesses were judged according to their
demands; and the highest bidder was supposed to understand her
own claims best.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore was a finishing governess
of the highest order, thinking it an insult to be offered a pupil
below her teens, or to lose one till nearly beyond them; nor was
she far from being the treasure that Mrs. Fulmort pronounced her,
in gratitude for the absence of all the explosions produced by
the various imperfections of her predecessors.</p>
<p>A highly able woman, and perfectly sincere, she possessed the
qualities of a ruler, and had long experience in the art.&nbsp;
Her discipline was perfect in machinery, and her instructions
admirably complete.&nbsp; No one could look at her keen,
sensible, self-possessed countenance, her decided mouth, ever
busy hands, and unpretending but well-chosen style of dress,
without seeing that her energy and intelligence were of a high
order; and there was principle likewise, though no one ever quite
penetrated to the foundation of it.&nbsp; Certainly she was not
an irreligious person; she conformed, as she said, to the habits
of each family she lived with, and she highly estimated moral
perfections.&nbsp; Now and then a degree of scorn, for the
narrowness of dogma, would appear in reading history, but in
general she was understood to have opinions which she did not
obtrude.</p>
<p>As a teacher she was excellent; but her own strong
conformation prevented her from understanding that young girls
were incapable of such tension of intellect as an enthusiastic
scholar of forty-two, and that what was sport to her was toil to
a mind unaccustomed to constant attention.&nbsp; Change of labour
is not rest, unless it be through gratification of the
will.&nbsp; Her very best pupil she had killed.&nbsp; Finding a
very sharp sword, in a very frail scabbard, she had whetted the
one and worn down the other, by every stimulus in her power, till
a jury of physicians might have found her guilty of manslaughter;
but perfectly unconscious of her own agency in causing the
atrophy, her dear Anna Webster lived foremost in her affections,
the model for every subsequent pupil.&nbsp; She seldom remained
more than two years in a family.&nbsp; Sometimes the young brains
were over-excited; more often they fell into a dreary state of
drilled diligence; but she was too much absorbed in the studies
to look close into the human beings, and marvelled when the
fathers and mothers were blind enough to part with her on the
plea of health and need of change.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>On the whole she had never liked any of her charges
since the renowned Anna Webster so well as Ph&oelig;be Fulmort;
although her abilities did not rise above the &lsquo;very
fair,&rsquo; and she was apt to be bewildered in metaphysics and
political economy; but then she had none of the eccentricities of
will and temper of Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s clever girls, nor was
she like most good-humoured ones, recklessly
<i>insouciante</i>.&nbsp; Her only drawback, in the
governess&rsquo;s eyes, was that she never seemed desirous of
going beyond what was daily required of her&mdash;each study was
a duty, and not a subject of zeal.</p>
<p>Presently Miss Fennimore came back, followed by the two
sisters, neither of them in the best of tempers.&nbsp; Maria, a
stout, clumsily-made girl of fifteen, had the same complexion and
open eyes as Ph&oelig;be, but her colouring was muddled, the gaze
full-orbed and vacant, and the lips, always pouting, were just
now swelled with the vexation that filled her prominent eyelids
with tears.&nbsp; Bertha, two years younger, looked as if nature
had designed her for a boy, and the change into a girl was not
yet decided.&nbsp; She, too, was very like Maria; but
Maria&rsquo;s open nostrils were in her a droll
<i>retrouss&eacute;</i>, puggish little nose; her chin had a
boyish squareness and decision, her round cheeks had two comical
dimples, her eyes were either stretched in defiance or narrowed
up with fun, and a slight cast in one gave a peculiar archness
and character to her face; her skin, face, hands, and all, were
uniformly pinky; her hair in such obstinate yellow curls, that it
was to be hoped, for her sake, that the fashion of being
<i>cr&eacute;p&eacute;</i> might continue.&nbsp; The brow lowered
in petulance; and as she kissed Ph&oelig;be, she muttered in her
ear a vituperation of the governess in schoolroom <i>patois</i>;
then began tossing the lesson-books in the air and catching them
again, as a preliminary to finding the places, thus drawing on
herself a reproof in German.&nbsp; French and German were
alternately spoken in lesson hours by Ph&oelig;be and Bertha, who
had lived with foreign servants from infancy; but poor Maria had
not the faculty of keeping the tongues distinct, and corrections
only terrified her into confusion worse confounded, until Miss
Fennimore had in despair decided that English was the best
alternative.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be practised vigorously.&nbsp; Aware that nothing
pleasant was passing, and that, be it what it might, she could do
no good, she was glad to stop her ears with her music, until
eight o&rsquo;clock brought a pause in the shape of
breakfast.&nbsp; Formerly the schoolroom party had joined the
family meal, but since the two elder girls had been out, and
Mervyn&rsquo;s friends had been often in the house, it had been
decided that the home circle was too numerous; and what had once
been the play-room was allotted to be the eating-room of the
younger ones, without passing the red door, on the other side of
which lay the world.</p>
<p>Breakfast was announced by the schoolroom maid, and Miss
Fennimore rose.&nbsp; No sooner was her back turned, than Bertha
indulged in a tremendous writhing yawn, wriggling in her chair,
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>and clenching both fat fists, as she threatened with
each, at her governess&rsquo;s retreating figure, so ludicrously,
that Ph&oelig;be smiled while she shook her head, and an
explosive giggle came from Maria, causing the lady to turn and
behold Miss Bertha demure as ever, and a look of disconsolate
weariness fast settling down on each of the two young
faces.&nbsp; The unbroken routine pressed heavily at those fit
moments for family greetings and for relaxation, and even
Ph&oelig;be would gladly have been spared the German account of
the Holt and of Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s book, for which she was
called upon.&nbsp; Bertha meanwhile, to whom waggishness was
existence, was carrying on a silent drama on her plate, her roll
being a quarry, and her knife the workmen attacking it.&nbsp; Now
she undermined, now acted an explosion, with uplifted eyebrows
and an indicated &lsquo;puff!&rsquo; with her lips, with constant
dumb-show directed to Maria, who, without half understanding, was
in a constant suppressed titter, sometimes concealed by her
pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>Quick as Miss Fennimore was, and often as she frowned on
Maria&rsquo;s outbreaks, she never could detect their
provocative.&nbsp; Over-restraint and want of sympathy were
direct instruction in unscrupulous slyness of amusement.&nbsp; A
sentence of displeasure on Maria&rsquo;s ill-mannered folly was
in the act of again filling her eyes with tears, when there was a
knock at the door, and all the faces beamed with glad
expectation.</p>
<p>It was Robert.&nbsp; This was the time of day when he knew
Miss Fennimore could best tolerate him, and he seldom failed to
make his appearance on his way down-stairs, the only one of the
privileged race who was a wonted object on this side the baize
door.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be thought he looked more cheerful, and
indeed gravity could hardly have withstood Bertha&rsquo;s face,
as she gave a mischievous tweak to his hair behind, under colour
of putting her arm round his neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Curlylocks, how much mischief did you do
yesterday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d no spirits for mischief,&rsquo; she answered,
with mock pitifulness, twinkling up her eyes, and rubbing them
with her knuckles as if she were crying.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
barbarous wretch, taking Ph&oelig;be to feast on strawberries and
cream with Miss Charlecote, and leaving poor me to poke in that
stupid drawing-room, with nothing to do but to count the scollops
of mamma&rsquo;s flounce!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your turn.&nbsp; Will Miss Fennimore kindly let
you have a walk with me this evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And me,&rsquo; said Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, of course.&nbsp; May I come for them at five
o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hardly tell what to say about Maria.&nbsp; I do
not like to disappoint her, but she knows that nothing displeases
me so much as that ill-mannered habit of giggling,&rsquo; said
Miss Fennimore, not without concern.&nbsp; Merciful as to
Maria&rsquo;s attainments, she was strict as to her manners, and
was striving to teach her self-restraint enough to be
unobtrusive.</p>
<p>Poor Maria&rsquo;s eyes were glassy with tears, her chest
heaved <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>with sobs, and she broke out,
&lsquo;O pray, Miss Fennimore, O pray!&rsquo; while all the
others interceded for her; and Bertha, well knowing that it was
all her fault, avoided the humiliation of a confession, by the
apparent generosity of exclaiming, &lsquo;Take us both to-morrow
instead, Robin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s journey was, however, fixed for that day, and
on this plea, licence was given for the walk.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be
smiled congratulation, but Maria was slow in cheering up; and
when, on returning to the schoolroom, the three sisters were left
alone together for a few moments, she pressed up to
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s side, and said, &lsquo;Ph&oelig;be,
I&rsquo;ve not said my prayers.&nbsp; Do you think anything will
happen to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her awfully mysterious tone set Bertha laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, Maria, all the cows in the park will run at
you,&rsquo; she was beginning, when the grave rebuke of
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eyes cut her short.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was it, my dear?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be, tenderly
fondling her sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was so sleepy, and Bertha would blow soap-bubbles in
her hands while we were washing, and then Miss Fennimore came,
and I&rsquo;ve been naughty now, and I know I shall go on, and
then Robin won&rsquo;t take me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will ask Miss Fennimore to let you go to your room,
dearest,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must not play
again in dressing time, for there&rsquo;s nothing so sad as to
miss our prayers.&nbsp; You are a good girl to care so
much.&nbsp; Had you time for yours, Bertha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, plenty!&rsquo; with a toss of her curly head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t take ages about things, like
Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prayers cannot be hurried,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
looking distressed, and she was about to remind Bertha to whom
she spoke in prayer, when the child cut her short by the
exclamation, &lsquo;Nonsense, Maria, about being naughty.&nbsp;
You know I always make you laugh when I please, and that has more
to do with it than saying your prayers, I fancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, very sadly, &lsquo;if
you had said yours more in earnest, my poor Bertha, you would
either not have made Maria laugh, or would not have left her to
bear all the blame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you call me poor?&rsquo; exclaimed Bertha, with
a half-offended, half-diverted look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I wish so much that you knew better, or that I
could help you better,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, gently.</p>
<p>There Miss Fennimore entered, displeased at the English
sounds, and at finding them all, as she thought, loitering.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be explained Maria&rsquo;s omission, and Miss Fennimore
allowed her five minutes in her own room, saying that this must
not become a precedent, though she did not wish to oppress her
conscience.</p>
<p>Bertha&rsquo;s eyes glittered with a certain triumph, as she
saw that Miss Fennimore was of her mind, and anticipated no
consequences from the neglect, but only made the concession as to
a superstition.&nbsp; Without disbelief, the child trained only
to reason, <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>and quick to detect fallacy, was
blind to all that was not material.&nbsp; And how was the
spiritual to be brought before her?</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be might well sigh as she sat down to her abstract of
Schlegel&rsquo;s Lectures.&nbsp; &lsquo;If any one would but
teach them,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;but there is no time at
all, and I myself do not know half so much of those things as one
of Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s lowest classes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was a little mistaken.&nbsp; An earnest mind
taught how to learn, with access to the Bible and Prayer Book,
could gain more from these fountain-heads than any external
teaching could impart; and she could carry her difficulties to
Robert.&nbsp; Still it was out of her power to assist her
sisters.&nbsp; Surveillance and driving absolutely left no space
free from Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s requirements; and all that there
was to train those young ones in faith, was the manner in which
it <i>lived</i> and worked in her.&nbsp; Nor of this effect could
she be conscious.</p>
<p>As to dreams or repinings, or even listening to her hopes and
fears for her project of pleasure, they were excluded by the
concentrated attention that Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s system
enforced.&nbsp; Time and capacity were so much on the stretch,
that the habit of doing <i>what</i> she was doing, and nothing
else, had become second nature to the docile and duteous girl;
and she had become little sensible to interruptions; so she went
on with her German, her Greek, and her algebra, scarcely hearing
the repetitions of the lessons, or the counting as Miss Fennimore
presided over Maria&rsquo;s practice, a bit of drudgery detested
by the governess, but necessarily persevered in, for Maria loved
music, and had just voice and ear sufficient to render this
single accomplishment not hopeless, but a certain want of power
of sustained effort made her always break down at the moment she
seemed to be doing best.&nbsp; Former governesses had lost
patience, but Miss Fennimore had early given up the case, and
never scolded her for her failures; she made her attempt less,
and she was improving more, and shedding fewer tears than under
any former dynasty.&nbsp; Even a stern dominion is better for the
subjects than an uncertain and weak one; regularity gives a sense
of reliance; and constant occupation leaves so little time for
being naughty, that Bertha herself was getting into training, and
on the present day her lessons were exemplary, always with a view
to the promised walk with her brother, one of the greatest
pleasures ever enjoyed by the denizens of the west wing.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s pleasure was less certain, and less
dependent on her merits, yet it invigorated her efforts to do all
she had to do with all her might, even into the statement of the
pros and cons of customs and free-trade, which she was required
to produce as her morning&rsquo;s exercise.&nbsp; In the midst,
her ear detected the sound of wheels, and her heart throbbed in
the conviction that it was Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s pony carriage;
nay, she found her pen had indited &lsquo;Robin would be so
glad,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;revenue to the government,&rsquo;
and while scratching the words <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>out beyond
all legibility, she blamed herself for betraying such want of
self-command.</p>
<p>No summons came, no tidings, the wheels went away; her heart
sank, and her spirit revolted against an unfeeling, unutterably
wearisome captivity; but it was only a moment&rsquo;s fluttering
against the bars, the tears were driven back with the thought,
&lsquo;After all, the decision is guided from Above.&nbsp; If I
stay at home, it <i>must</i> be best for me.&nbsp; Let me try to
be good!&rsquo; and she forced her mind back to her exports and
her customs.&nbsp; It was such discipline as few girls could have
exercised, but the conscientious effort was no small assistance
in being resigned; and in the precious minutes granted in which
to prepare herself for dinner, she found it the less hard task to
part with her anticipations of delight and brace herself to
quiet, contented duty.</p>
<p>The meal was beginning when, with a very wide expansion of the
door, appeared a short, consequential-looking personage, of such
plump, rounded proportions, that she seemed ready to burst out of
her riding-habit, and of a broad, complacent visage, somewhat
overblooming.&nbsp; It was Miss Fulmort, the eldest of the
family, a young lady just past thirty, a very awful distance from
the schoolroom party, to whom she nodded with good-natured
condescension, saying: &lsquo;Ah! I thought I should find you at
dinner; I&rsquo;m come for something to sustain nature.&nbsp; The
riding party are determined to have me with them, and they
won&rsquo;t wait for luncheon.&nbsp; Thank you, yes, a piece of
mutton, if there were any under side.&nbsp; How it reminds me of
old times.&nbsp; I used so to look forward to never seeing a loin
of mutton again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As your chief ambition?&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore,
who, governess as she was, could not help being a little
satirical, especially when Bertha&rsquo;s eyes twinkled
responsively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One does get so tired of mutton and
rice-pudding,&rsquo; answered the less observant Miss Fulmort,
who was but dimly conscious of any one&rsquo;s existence save her
own, and could not have credited a governess laughing at her;
&lsquo;but really this is not so bad, after all, for a change;
and some pale ale.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean that you exist
without pale ale?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all drink water by preference,&rsquo; said Miss
Fennimore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Miss Watson, our finishing governess,
never drank anything but claret, and she always had little
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s</i>, or fish, or something, because she
said her appetite was to be consulted, she was so delicate.&nbsp;
She was very thin, I know; and what a figure you have,
Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; I suppose that is water drinking.&nbsp;
Bridger did say it would reduce me to leave off pale ale, but I
can&rsquo;t get on without it, I get so horridly low.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a sign, Miss
Fennimore?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, a sign of what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That one can&rsquo;t go on without it.&nbsp; Miss
Charlecote said she thought it was all constitution whether one
is stout or not, and that nothing made much difference, when I
asked her about German wines.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&lsquo;Oh! Augusta, has Miss Charlecote been here this
morning?&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; she came at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and there was I
actually pinned down to entertain her, for mamma was not come
down.&nbsp; So I asked her about those light foreign wines, and
whether they do really make one thinner; you know one always has
them at her house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did mamma see her?&rsquo; asked poor Ph&oelig;be,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, she was bent upon it.&nbsp; It was something
about you.&nbsp; Oh! she wants to take you to stay with her in
that horrible hole of hers in the City&mdash;very odd of
her.&nbsp; What do you advise me to do, Miss Fennimore?&nbsp; Do
you think those foreign wines would bring me down a little, or
that they would make me low and sinking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, I have no experience on the subject!&rsquo;
said Miss Fennimore, loftily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did mamma say?&rsquo; was poor Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
almost breathless question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it makes no difference to mamma&rsquo;
(Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart bounded); but Augusta went on:
&lsquo;she always has her soda-water, you know; but of course I
should take a hamper from Bass.&nbsp; I hate being
unprovided.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But about my going to London?&rsquo; humbly murmured
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>did</i> she say?&rsquo; considered the elder
sister, aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m
sure.&nbsp; I was not attending&mdash;the heat does make one so
sleepy&mdash;but I know we all wondered she should want you at
your age.&nbsp; You know some people take a spoonful of vinegar
to fine themselves down, and some of those wines <i>are</i> very
acid,&rsquo; she continued, pressing on with her great subject of
consultation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be an object with you, Miss Fulmort, I should
recommend the vinegar,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is nothing like doing a thing outright!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, oh! how glorious it would be to see her taking
it!&rsquo; whispered Bertha into Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s ear, unheard
by Augusta, who, in her satisfied stolidity, was declaring,
&lsquo;No, I could not undertake that.&nbsp; I am the worst
person in the world for taking anything disagreeable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And having completed her meal, which she had contrived to make
out of the heart of the joint, leaving the others little but fat,
she walked off to her ride, believing that she had done a
gracious and condescending action in making conversation with her
inferiors of the west wing.</p>
<p>Yet Augusta Fulmort might have been good for something, if her
mind and her affections had not lain fallow ever since she
escaped from a series of governesses who taught her
self-indulgence by example.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder what mamma said!&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be,
in her strong craving for sympathy in her suspense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry the subject has been brought forward, if it
is to <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>unsettle you, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo;
said Miss Fennimore, not unkindly; &lsquo;I regret your being
twice disappointed; but, if your mother should refer it to me, as
I make no doubt she will, I should say that it would be a great
pity to break up our course of studies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would only be for a little while,&rsquo; sighed
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;and Miss Charlecote is to show me all the
museums.&nbsp; I should see more with her than ever I shall when
I am come out; and I should be with Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I intended asking permission to take you through a
systematic course of lectures and specimens when the family are
next in town,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ordinary,
desultory sight-seeing leaves few impressions; and though Miss
Charlecote is a superior person, her mind is not of a
sufficiently scientific turn to make her fully able to direct
you.&nbsp; I shall trust to your good sense, Ph&oelig;be, for
again submitting to defer the pleasure till it can be
enhanced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Good sense had a task imposed on it for which it was quite
inadequate; but there was something else in Ph&oelig;be which
could do the work better than her unconvinced reason.&nbsp; Even
had she been sure of the expediency of being condemned to the
schoolroom, no good sense would have brought that resolute smile,
or driven back the dew in her eyes, or enabled her voice to say,
with such sweet meekness, &lsquo;Very well, Miss Fennimore; I
dare say it may be right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore was far more concerned than if the submission
had been grudging.&nbsp; She debated with herself whether she
should consider her resolution irrevocable.</p>
<p>Ten minutes were allowed after dinner in the parterre, and
these could only be spent under the laurel hedge; the sun was far
too hot everywhere else.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be had here no lack of
sympathy, but had to restrain Bertha, who, with angry gestures,
was pronouncing the governess a horrid cross-patch, and declaring
that no girls ever were used as they were; while Maria observed,
that if Ph&oelig;be went to London, she must go too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall all go some day,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
cheerfully, &lsquo;and we shall enjoy it all the more if we are
good now.&nbsp; Never mind, Bertha, we shall have some nice
walks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, all bothered with botany,&rsquo; muttered
Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought, at least, you would be glad of me,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be, smiling; &lsquo;you who stay at
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure, I am,&rsquo; said Bertha; &lsquo;but it is
such a shame!&nbsp; I shall tell Robin, and he&rsquo;ll say so
too.&nbsp; I shall tell him you nearly cried!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t vex Robin,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When you go out, you should set yourself to tell him
pleasant things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I&rsquo;m to tell him you wouldn&rsquo;t go on any
account.&nbsp; You like your political economy much too
well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose you say nothing about it,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Make yourself merry with him.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do.&nbsp; He takes you out
to entertain you, not to worry about grievances.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&lsquo;Do you never talk about grievances?&rsquo; asked
Bertha, twinkling up her eyes.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be hesitated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not my own,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;because I have not got any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has Robert, then?&rsquo; asked Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody has grievances who is out of the
schoolroom,&rsquo; opined Maria; and as she uttered this profound
sentiment, the tinkle of Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s little bell
warned the sisters to return to the studies, which in the heat of
summer were pursued in the afternoon, that the walk might be
taken in the cool of the evening.&nbsp; Reading aloud, drawing,
and sensible plain needlework were the avocations till it was
time to learn the morrow&rsquo;s lessons.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be being
beyond this latter work, drew on, and in the intervals of helping
Maria with her geography, had time to prepare such a bright face
as might make Robert think lightly of her disappointment, and not
reckon it as another act of tyranny.</p>
<p>When he opened the door, however, there was that in his looks
which made her spirits leap up like an elastic spring; and his
&lsquo;Well, Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; was almost triumphant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it&mdash;am I&mdash;&rsquo; was all she could
say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has no one thought it worth while to tell
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rsquo; interposed Bertha,
&lsquo;you on the other side the red baize door might be all
married, or dead and buried, for aught we should hear.&nbsp; But
is Ph&oelig;be to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be, afraid yet to
hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; My father heard the invitation, and said
that you were a good girl, and deserved a holiday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commendation from that quarter was so rare, that excess of
gladness made Ph&oelig;be cast down her eyes and colour
intensely, a little oppressed by the victory over her
governess.&nbsp; But Miss Fennimore spoke warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
cannot think her more deserving than I do.&nbsp; I am rejoiced
not to have been consulted, for I could hardly have borne to
inflict such a mortification on her, though these interruptions
are contrary to my views.&nbsp; As it is, Ph&oelig;be, my dear, I
wish you joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; Ph&oelig;be managed to say, while the
happy tears fairly started.&nbsp; In that chilly land, the least
approach to tenderness was like the gleam in which the hardy
woodbine leaflets unfold to sun themselves.</p>
<p>Thankful for small mercies, thought Robert, looking at her
with fond pity; but at least the dear child will have one
fortnight of a more genial atmosphere, and soon, maybe, I shall
transplant her to be Lucilla&rsquo;s darling as well as mine,
free from task-work, and doing the labours of love for which she
is made!</p>
<p>He was quite in spirits, and able to reply in kind to the
freaks and jokes of his little sister, as she started, spinning
round him like a humming-top, and singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Will you go to the wood, Robin a Bobbin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>giving safe vent to an ebullition of spirits that must
last her a good while, poor little maiden!</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be took a sober walk with Miss Fennimore, receiving
advice on methodically journalizing what she might see, and on
the scheme of employments which might prevent her visit from
being waste of time.&nbsp; The others would have resented the
interference with the holiday; but Ph&oelig;be, though a little
sorry to find that tasks were not to be off her mind, was too
grateful for Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s cordial consent to entertain
any thought except of obedience to the best of her power.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore was politely summoned to Mrs. Fulmort&rsquo;s
dressing-room for the official communication; but this day was no
exception to the general custom, that the red baize door was not
passed by the young ladies until their evening appearance in the
drawing-room.&nbsp; Then the trio descended, all alike in white
muslin, made high, and green sashes&mdash;a dress carefully
distinguishing Ph&oelig;be as not introduced, but very becoming
to her, with the simple folds and the little net ruche, suiting
admirably the tall, rounded slenderness of her shape, her long
neck, and short, childish contour of face, where there smiled a
joy of anticipation almost inappreciable to those who know not
what it is to spend day after day with nothing particular to look
forward to.</p>
<p>Very grand was the drawing-room, all amber-coloured with
satin-wood, satin and gold, and with everything useless and
costly encumbering tables that looked as if nothing could ever be
done upon them.&nbsp; Such a room inspired a sense of being in
company, and it was no wonder that Mrs. Fulmort and her two elder
daughters swept in in as decidedly procession style as if they
had formed part of a train of twenty.</p>
<p>The star that bestowed three female sovereigns to Europe
seemed to have had the like influence on Hiltonbury parish, since
both its squires were heiresses.&nbsp; Miss Mervyn would have
been a happier woman had she married a plain country gentleman,
like those of her own stock, instead of giving a county position
to a man of lower origin and enormous monied wealth.&nbsp; To
live up to the claims of that wealth had been her business ever
since, and health and enjoyment had been so completely sacrificed
to it, that for many years past the greater part of her time had
been spent in resting and making herself up for her appearance in
the evening, when she conducted her elder daughters to their
gaieties.&nbsp; Faded and tallowy in complexion, so as to be
almost ghastly in her blue brocade and heavy gold ornaments, she
reclined languidly on a large easy-chair, saying with half-closed
eyes&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ph&oelig;be, Miss Fennimore has told you of Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s invitation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, mamma.&nbsp; I am very, <i>very</i> much
obliged!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know you are not to fancy yourself come out,&rsquo;
said Juliana, the second sister, who had a good tall figure, and
<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>features and complexion not far from beauty, but marred
by a certain shrewish tone and air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; answered Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but with
Miss Charlecote that will make no difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Probably not,&rsquo; said Juliana; &lsquo;for of course
you will see nobody but a set of old maids and clergymen and
their wives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She need not go far for old maids,&rsquo; whispered
Bertha to Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, in which class do you reckon the
Sandbrooks?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, smiling; &lsquo;for she
chiefly goes to meet them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She may go!&rsquo; said Juliana, scornfully; &lsquo;but
Lucilla Sandbrook is far past attending to her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder whether the Charterises will take any notice
of Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; exclaimed Augusta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Fulmort, waking slowly to
another idea, &lsquo;I will tell Boodle to talk
to&mdash;what&rsquo;s your maid&rsquo;s name?&mdash;about your
dresses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, mamma,&rsquo; interposed Juliana, &lsquo;it will be
only poking about the exhibitions with Miss Charlecote.&nbsp; You
may have that plaid silk of mine that I was going to have worn
out abroad, half-price for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha fairly made a little stamp at Juliana, and clenched her
fist.</p>
<p>If Ph&oelig;be dreaded anything in the way of dress, it was
Juliana&rsquo;s half-price.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, your papa would not like her not to be well
fitted out,&rsquo; said her mother; &lsquo;and Honora Charlecote
always has such handsome things.&nbsp; I wish Boodle could put
mine on like hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, very well!&rsquo; said Juliana, rather offended;
&lsquo;only it should be understood what is to be done if the
Charterises ask her to any of their parties.&nbsp; There will be
such mistakes and confusion if she meets any one we know; and you
particularly objected to having her brought forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eye was a little startled, and Bertha set
her front teeth together on edge, and looked viciously at
Juliana.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, Honora Charlecote never goes out,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Fulmort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she should, you understand, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said
Juliana.</p>
<p>Coffee came in at the moment, and Augusta criticized the
strength of it, which made a diversion, during which Bertha
slipped out of the room, with a face replete with mischievous
exultation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are not you going to play to-night, my dears?&rsquo;
asked Mrs. Fulmort.&nbsp; &lsquo;What was that duet I heard you
practising?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Juliana,&rsquo; said the elder sister, &lsquo;I
meant to go over it again; I am not satisfied with my
part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have to write a note,&rsquo; said Juliana, moving off
to another table; whereupon Ph&oelig;be ventured to propose
herself as a substitute, and was accepted.</p>
<p>Maria sat entranced, with her mouth open; and presently Mrs.
Fulmort looked up from a kind of doze to ask who was <!-- page
118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>playing.&nbsp; For some moments she had no
answer.&nbsp; Maria was too much awed for speech in the
drawing-room; and though Bertha had come back, she had her back
to her mother, and did not hear.&nbsp; Mrs. Fulmort exerted
herself to sit up and turn her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was that Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have a clear, good touch, my dear, as they used to say I had when
I was at school at Bath.&nbsp; Play another of your pieces, my
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am ready now, Augusta,&rsquo; said Juliana,
advancing.</p>
<p>Little girls were not allowed at the piano when officers might
be coming in from the dining-room, so Maria&rsquo;s face became
vacant again, for Juliana&rsquo;s music awoke no echoes within
her.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be beckoned her to a remote ottoman, a receptacle for
the newspapers of the week, and kept her turning over the
<i>Illustrated News</i>, an unfailing resource with her, but
powerless to occupy Bertha after the first Saturday; and Bertha,
turning a deaf ear to the assurance that there was something very
entertaining about a tiger-hunt, stood, solely occupied by eyeing
Juliana.</p>
<p>Was she studying &lsquo;come-out&rsquo; life as she watched
her sisters surrounded by the gentlemen who presently herded
round the piano?</p>
<p>It was nearly the moment when the young ones were bound to
withdraw, when Mervyn, coming hastily up to their ottoman, had
almost stumbled over Maria&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg pardon.&nbsp; Oh, it was only you!&nbsp; What a cow
it is!&rsquo; said he, tossing over the papers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you looking for, Mervyn?&rsquo; asked
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An advertisement&mdash;<i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i> for the
3rd.&nbsp; That rascal, Mears, must have taken it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She found it for him, and likewise the advertisement, which
he, missing once, was giving up in despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he observed, while she was searching,
&lsquo;so you are to chip the shell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m only going to London&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
coming out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gammon!&rsquo; he said, with an odd wink.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You need never go in again, like the what&rsquo;s-his-name
in the fairy tale, or you are a sillier child than I take you
for.&nbsp; They&rsquo;&mdash;nodding at the
piano&mdash;&lsquo;are getting a terrible pair of old cats, and
we want something young and pretty about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this unusual compliment, Ph&oelig;be, seeing the way
clear to the door, rose to depart, most reluctantly followed by
Bertha, and more willingly by Maria, who began, the moment they
were in the hall&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, why do they get a couple of terrible old
cats?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like them.&nbsp; I shall be
afraid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rsquo; began perplexed
Ph&oelig;be, cut short by Bertha&rsquo;s boisterous
laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Maria, what a goose you are!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be the death of me some day!&nbsp; Why, Juliana and
Augusta are the cats themselves.&nbsp; Oh, dear! I wanted to <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>kiss Mervyn for saying so.&nbsp; Oh, wasn&rsquo;t it
fun!&nbsp; And now, Maria,&mdash;oh! if I could have stayed a
moment longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha, Bertha, not such a noise in the hall.&nbsp;
Come, Maria; mind, you must not tell anybody.&nbsp; Bertha,
come,&rsquo; expostulated Ph&oelig;be, trying to drag her sister
to the red baize door; but Bertha stood, bending nearly double,
exaggerating the helplessness of her paroxysms of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, at least the cat will have something to scratch
her,&rsquo; she gasped out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I did so want to
stay and see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been playing any tricks?&rsquo; exclaimed
Ph&oelig;be, with consternation, as Bertha&rsquo;s deportment
recurred to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tricks?&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Oh,
listen, Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; cried Bertha, with her wicked look of
triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;I brought home such a lovely sting-nettle
for Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s peacock caterpillar; and when I heard
how kind dear Juliana was to you about your visit to London, I
thought she really must have it for a reward; so I ran away, and
slily tucked it into her bouquet; and I did so hope she would
take it up to fiddle with when the gentlemen talk to her,&rsquo;
said the elf, with an irresistibly comic imitation of
Juliana&rsquo;s manner towards gentlemen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha, this is beyond&mdash;&rsquo; began
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you sting your fingers?&rsquo; asked
Maria.</p>
<p>Bertha stuck out her fat pink paws, embellished with sundry
white lumps.&nbsp; &lsquo;All pleasure,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;thinking of the jump Juliana will give, and how nicely it
serves her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was already on her way back to the drawing-rooms;
Bertha sprang after, but in vain.&nbsp; Never would she have
risked the success of her trick, could she have guessed that
Ph&oelig;be would have the temerity to return to the company!</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be glided in without waiting for the sense of
awkwardness, though she knew she should have to cross the whole
room, and she durst not ask any one to bring the dangerous
bouquet to her&mdash;not even Robert&mdash;he must not be stung
in her service.</p>
<p>She met her mother&rsquo;s astonished eye as she threaded her
way; she wound round a group of gentlemen, and spied the article
of which she was in quest, where Juliana had laid it down with
her gloves on going to the piano.&nbsp; Actually she had
it!&nbsp; She had seized it unperceived!&nbsp; Good little thief;
it was a most innocent robbery.&nbsp; She crept away with a sense
of guilt and desire to elude observation, positively starting
when she encountered her father&rsquo;s portly figure in the
ante-room.&nbsp; He stopped her with &lsquo;Going to bed,
eh?&nbsp; So Miss Charlecote has taken a fancy to you, has
she?&nbsp; It does you credit.&nbsp; What shall you want for the
journey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boodle is going to see,&rsquo; began Ph&oelig;be, but
he interrupted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will fifty do?&nbsp; I will have my daughters well
turned out.&nbsp; All to be spent upon yourself, mind.&nbsp; Why,
you&rsquo;ve not a bit of jewellery on!&nbsp; Have you a
watch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&lsquo;Robert shall choose one for you, then.&nbsp;
Come to my room any time for the cash; and if Miss Charlecote
takes you anywhere among her set&mdash;good connections she
has&mdash;and you want to be rigged out extra, send me in the
bill&mdash;anything rather than be shabby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, papa!&nbsp; Then, if I am asked out
anywhere, may I go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what does the child mean?&nbsp; Anywhere that Miss
Charlecote likes to take you of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only because I am not come out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff about coming out!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like my
girls to be shy and backward.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve a right to show
themselves anywhere; and you should be going out with us now, but
somehow your poor mother doesn&rsquo;t like the trouble of such a
lot of girls.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t be shy, but make the most of
yourself, for you won&rsquo;t meet many better endowed, nor more
highly accomplished.&nbsp; Good night, and enjoy
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Palpitating with wonder and pleasure, Ph&oelig;be
escaped.&nbsp; Such permission, over-riding all Juliana&rsquo;s
injunctions, was worth a few nettle stings and a great fright;
for Ph&oelig;be was not philosopher enough, in spite of Miss
Fennimore&mdash;ay, and of Robert&mdash;not to have a keen desire
to see a great party.</p>
<p>Her delay had so much convinced the sisters that her
expedition had had some fearful consequences, that Maria was
already crying lest dear Ph&oelig;be should be in disgrace; and
Bertha had seated herself on the balusters, debating with herself
whether, if Ph&oelig;be were suspected of the trick (a likely
story) and condemned to lose her visit to London, she would
confess herself the guilty person.</p>
<p>And when Ph&oelig;be came back, too much overcome with delight
to do anything but communicate papa&rsquo;s goodness, and rejoice
in the unlimited power of making presents, Bertha triumphantly
insisted on her confessing that it had been a capital thing that
the nettles were in Juliana&rsquo;s nosegay!</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be shook her head; too happy to scold, too humble to
draw the moral that the surest way to gratification is to remove
the thorns from the path of others.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<blockquote><p>She gives thee a garland woven fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care!<br />
It is a fool&rsquo;s-cap for thee to wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beware!&nbsp; Beware!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust her not,<br />
She is fooling thee!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Longfellow</span>,
from <span class="smcap">M&uuml;ller</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behold Ph&oelig;be Fulmort seated in a train on the way to
London.&nbsp; She was a very pleasant spectacle to Miss
Charlecote opposite to her, so peacefully joyous was her face, as
she sat with the wind breathing in on her, in the calm luxury of
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>contemplating the landscape gliding past the windows in
all its summer charms, and the repose of having no one to hunt
her into unvaried rationality.</p>
<p>Her eye was the first to detect Robert in waiting at the
terminus, but he looked more depressed than ever, and scarcely
smiled as he handed them to the carriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get in, Robert, you are coming home with us,&rsquo;
said Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have so much to take, I should encumber
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, the sundries go in cabs, with the maids.&nbsp; Jump
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do your friends arrive to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but that is no reason you should look so
rueful!&nbsp; Make the most of Ph&oelig;be beforehand.&nbsp;
Besides, Mr. Parsons is a Wykehamist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert took his place on the back seat, but still as if he
would have preferred walking home.&nbsp; Neither his sister nor
his friend dared to ask whether he had seen Lucilla.&nbsp; Could
she have refused him? or was her frivolity preying on his
spirits?</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to interest him by the account of the family
migration, and of Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s promise that Maria and
Bertha should have two half-hours of real play in the garden on
each day when the lessons had been properly done; and how she had
been so kind as to let Maria leave off trying to read a French
book that had proved too hard for her, not perceiving why this
instance of good-nature was not cheering to her brother.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s house was a delightful marvel to
Ph&oelig;be from the moment when she rattled into the paved
court, entered upon the fragrant odour of the cedar hall, and saw
the Queen of Sheba&rsquo;s golden locks beaming with the evening
light.&nbsp; She entered the drawing-room, pleasant-looking
already, under the judicious arrangement of the housekeeper, who
had set out the Holt flowers and arranged the books, so that it
seemed full of welcome.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be ran from window to mantelpiece, enchanted with the
quaint mixture of old and new, admiring carving and stained
glass, and declaring that Owen had not prepared her for anything
equal to this, until Miss Charlecote, going to arrange matters
with her housekeeper, left the brother and sister together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Robin!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, coming up to him
anxiously.</p>
<p>He only crossed his arms on the mantelpiece, rested his head
on them, and sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you seen her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to speak to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you called?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then where did you see her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was riding in the Park.&nbsp; I was on
foot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She could not have seen you!&rsquo; exclaimed
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did,&rsquo; replied Robert; &lsquo;I was going to
tell you.&nbsp; She gave me one of her sweetest, brightest
smiles, such as only she <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>can
give.&nbsp; You know them, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; No assumed welcome,
but a sudden flash and sparkle of real gladness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why&mdash;what do you mean?&rsquo; asked
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;why have you not been to her?&nbsp; I thought
from your manner that she had been neglecting you, but it seems
to me all the other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot, Ph&oelig;be; I cannot put my poor pretensions
forward in the set she is with.&nbsp; I know they would influence
her, and that her decision would not be calm and
mature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her decision of what you are to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is fixed,&rsquo; said Robert, sighing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; With papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, in my own mind.&nbsp; I have seen enough of the
business to find that I could in ten years quadruple my capital,
and in the meantime maintain her in the manner she
prefers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite sure she prefers it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has done so ever since she could exercise a
choice.&nbsp; I should feel myself doing her an injustice if I
were to take advantage of any preference she may entertain for me
to condemn her to what would be to her a dreary
banishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not with you,&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know nothing about it, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; You have
never led such a life, and you it would not hurt&mdash;attract, I
mean; but lovely, fascinating, formed for admiration, and craving
for excitement as she is, she is a being that can only exist in
society.&nbsp; She would be miserable in homely
retirement&mdash;I mean she would prey on herself.&nbsp; I could
not ask it of her.&nbsp; If she consented, it would be without
knowing her own tastes.&nbsp; No; all that remains is to find out
whether she can submit to owe her wealth to our
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And shall you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not but defer it till I should meet her
here,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shrink from seeing her
with those cousins, or hearing her name with theirs.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, imagine my feelings when, going into Mervyn&rsquo;s
club with him, I heard &ldquo;Rashe Charteris and Cilly
Sandbrook&rdquo; contemptuously discussed by those very names,
and jests passing on their independent ways.&nbsp; I know how it
is.&nbsp; Those people work on her spirit of enterprise, and
she&mdash;too guileless and innocent to heed appearances.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, you do not wonder that I am nearly mad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Robin!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be
affectionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, indeed, I am sure, if Lucy once
had a hint&mdash;no, one could not tell her, it would shock her
too much; but if she had the least idea that people could be so
impertinent,&rsquo; and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s cheeks glowed with
shame and indignation, &lsquo;she would only wish to go away as
far as she could for fear of seeing any of them again.&nbsp; I am
sure they were not gentlemen, Robin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man must be supereminently a gentleman to respect a
woman who does not <i>make</i> him do so,&rsquo; said Robert
mournfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;That Miss Charteris!&nbsp; Oh! that she
were banished to Siberia!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be meditated a few moments; then looking up, said,
&lsquo;I <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>beg your pardon, Robin, but it does
strike me that, if you think that this kind of life is not good
for Lucilla, it cannot be right to sacrifice your own higher
prospects to enable her to continue it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said he, with some
impatience, &lsquo;I never was pledged.&nbsp; I may be of much
more use and influence, and able to effect more extended good as
a partner in a concern like this than as an obscure
clergyman.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had only time to utter a somewhat melancholy
&lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; before Miss Charlecote returned to
take her to her room, the promised brown cupboard, all wainscoted
with delicious cedar, so deeply and uniformly panelled, that when
shut, the door was not obvious; and it was like being in a box,
for there were no wardrobes, only shelves shut by doors into the
wall, which the old usage of the household tradition called
awmries (<i>armoires</i>).&nbsp; The furniture was reasonably
modern, but not obtrusively so.&nbsp; There was a delicious
recess in the deep window, with a seat and a table in it, and a
box of mignonette along the sill.&nbsp; It looked out into the
little high-walled entrance court, and beyond to the wall of the
warehouse opposite; and the roar of the great city thoroughfare
came like the distant surging of the ocean.&nbsp; Seldom had
young maiden&rsquo;s bower given more satisfaction.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be looked about her as if she hardly knew how to believe
in anything so unlike her ordinary life, and she thanked her
friend again and again with such enthusiasm, that Miss Charlecote
laughed as she told her she liked the old house to be
appreciated, since it had, like Pompeii, been potted for
posterity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And thank you, my dear,&rsquo; she added with a sigh,
&lsquo;for making my coming home so pleasant.&nbsp; May you never
know how I dreaded the finding it full of emptiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Miss Charlecote!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be,
venturing upon a warm kiss, and thrilled with sad pleasure as she
was pressed in a warm, clinging embrace, and felt tears on her
cheek.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have been so happy here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not the past, my dear,&rsquo; said Honora;
&lsquo;I could live peacefully on the thought of that.&nbsp; The
shadows that people this house are very gentle ones.&nbsp; It is
the present!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She broke off, for the gates of the court were opening to
admit a detachment of cabs, containing the persons and properties
of the new incumbent and his wife.&nbsp; He had been a curate of
Mr. Charlecote, since whose death he had led a very hard-working
life in various towns; and on his recent presentation to the
living of St. Wulstan&rsquo;s, Honora had begged him and his wife
to make her house their home while determining on the repairs of
the parsonage.&nbsp; She ran down to meet them with gladsome
steps.&nbsp; She had never entirely dropped her intercourse with
Mr. Parsons, though seldom meeting; and he was a relic of the
past, one of the very few who still called her by her Christian
name, and regarded her more as the clergyman&rsquo;s daughter of
St. Wulstan&rsquo;s than as lady of the Holt.&nbsp; Mrs. Parsons
was a thorough clergyman&rsquo;s wife, as active as himself, and
much loved and <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>esteemed by Honora, with whom, in
their few meetings, she had &lsquo;got on&rsquo; to
admiration.</p>
<p>There they were, looking after luggage, and paying cabs so
heedfully as not to remark their hostess standing on the stairs;
and she had time to survey them with the affectionate curiosity
of meeting after long absence, and with pleasure in remarking
that there was little change.&nbsp; Perhaps they were rather more
gray, and had grown more alike by force of living and thinking
together; but they both looked equally alert and cheerful, and as
if fifty and fifty-five were the very prime of years for
substantial work.</p>
<p>Their first glances at her were full of the same anxiety for
her health and strength, as they heartily shook hands, and
accompanied her into the drawing-room, she explaining that Mr.
Parsons was to have the study all to himself, and never be
disturbed there; then inquiring after the three children, two
daughters, who were married, and a son lately ordained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you would have brought William to see about
the curacy,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not strong enough,&rsquo; said his mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He wished it, but he is better where he is; he could not
bear the work here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I told him the utmost I should allow would be an
exchange now and then when my curates were overdone,&rsquo; said
Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so you are quite deserted,&rsquo; said Honor,
feeling the more drawn towards her friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Starting afresh, with a sort of honeymoon, as I tell
Anne,&rsquo; replied Mr. Parsons; and such a bright look passed
between them, as though they were quite sufficient for each
other, that Honor felt there was no parallel between their case
and her own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you have not lost your children yet,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Parsons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not with me,&rsquo; said Honor, quickly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lucy is with her cousins, and Owen&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
exactly know how he means to dispose of himself this vacation;
but we were all to meet here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Guessing, perhaps,
that Mr. Parsons saw into her dissatisfaction, she then assumed
their defence.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is to be a grand affair at
Castle Blanch, a celebration of young Charles Charteris&rsquo;s
marriage, and Owen and Lucy will be wanted for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom has he married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Miss Mendoza, an immense fortune&mdash;something in
the stockbroker line.&nbsp; He had spent a good deal, and wanted
to repair it; but they tell me she is a very handsome person,
very ladylike and agreeable; and Lucy likes her greatly.&nbsp; I
am to go to luncheon at their house to-morrow, so I shall treat
you as if you were at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should hope so,&rsquo; quoth Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, or I know you would not stay here properly.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not alone, either.&nbsp; Why, where&rsquo;s the boy
gone?&nbsp; I thought he was here.&nbsp; I have two young
Fulmorts, one staying here, the other looking in from the
office.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&lsquo;Fulmort!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Parsons, with
three notes of admiration at least in his voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What! the distiller?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The enemy himself, the identical lord of
gin-shops&mdash;at least his children.&nbsp; Did you not know
that he married my next neighbour, Augusta Mervyn, and that our
properties touch?&nbsp; He is not so bad by way of squire as he
is here; and I have known his wife all my life, so we keep up all
habits of good neighbourhood; and though they have brought up the
elder ones very ill, they have not succeeded in spoiling this son
and daughter.&nbsp; She is one of the very nicest girls I ever
knew, and he, poor fellow, has a great deal of good in
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I have heard William speak of a Fulmort,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Parsons.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was he at Winchester?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and an infinite help the influence there has been
to him.&nbsp; I never saw any one more anxious to do right, often
under great disadvantages.&nbsp; I shall be very glad for him to
be with you.&nbsp; He was always intended for a clergyman, but
now I am afraid there is a notion of putting him into the
business; and he is here attending to it for the present, while
his father and brother are abroad.&nbsp; I am sorry he is
gone.&nbsp; I suppose he was seized with a fit of
shyness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, when all the party had been to their rooms and
prepared for dinner, Robert reappeared, and was asked where he
had been.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to dress,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! where do you lodge?&nbsp; I asked Ph&oelig;be, but
she said your letters went to Whittington-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are two very good rooms at the office which my
father sometimes uses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be and Miss Charlecote glanced at each other, aware
that Mervyn would never have condescended to sleep in Great
Whittington-street.&nbsp; Mr. Parsons likewise perceived a
straight-forwardness in the manner, which made him ready to
acknowledge his fellow-Wykehamist and his son&rsquo;s
acquaintance; and they quickly became good friends over
recollections of Oxford and Winchester, tolerably strong in Mr.
Parsons himself, and all the fresher on
&lsquo;William&rsquo;s&rsquo; account.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, whose
experience of social intercourse was confined to the stately
evening hour in the drawing-room, had never listened to anything
approaching to this style of conversation, nor seen her brother
to so much advantage in society.&nbsp; Hitherto she had only
beheld him neglected in his uncongenial home circle, contemning
and contemned, or else subjected to the fretting torment of
Lucilla&rsquo;s caprice.&nbsp; She had never known what he could
be, at his ease, among persons of the same way of thinking.&nbsp;
Speaking scarcely ever herself, and her fingers busy with her
needle, she was receiving a better lesson than Miss Fennimore had
ever yet been able to give.&nbsp; The acquiring of knowledge is
one thing, the putting it out to profit another.</p>
<p>Gradually, from general topics, the conversation contracted
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>to the parish and its affairs, known intimately to Mr.
Parsons a quarter of a century ago, but in which Honora was now
the best informed; while Robert listened as one who felt as if he
might have a considerable stake therein, and indeed looked upon
usefulness there as compensation for the schemes he was
resigning.</p>
<p>The changes since Mr. Parsons&rsquo;s time had not been
cheering.&nbsp; The late incumbent had been a man whose trust lay
chiefly in preaching, and who, as his health failed, and he
became more unable to cope with the crying evils around, had
grown despairing, and given way to a sort of dismal, callous
indifference; not doing a little, because he could not do much,
and quashing the plans of others with a nervous dread of
innovation.&nbsp; The class of superior persons in trade, and
families of professional men, who in Mr. Charlecote&rsquo;s time
had filled many a massively-built pew, had migrated to the
suburbs, and preserved only an office or shop in the parish, an
empty pew in the church, where the congregation was to be counted
by tens instead of hundreds.&nbsp; Not that the population had
fallen off.&nbsp; Certain streets which had been a grief and pain
to Mr. Charlecote, but over which he had never entirely lost his
hold, had become intolerably worse.&nbsp; Improvements in other
parts of London, dislodging the inhabitants, had heaped them in
festering masses of corruption in these untouched byways and
lanes, places where honest men dared not penetrate without a
policeman; and report spoke of rooms shared by six families at
once.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons had not taken the cue unknowing of what he should
find in it; he said nothing, and looked as simple and cheerful as
if his life were not to be a daily course of heroism.&nbsp; His
wife gave one long, stifled sigh, and looked furtively upon him
with her loving eyes, in something of anxious fear, but with far
more of exultation.</p>
<p>Yet it was in no dispirited tone that she asked after the
respectable poor&mdash;there surely must be some employed in
small trades, or about the warehouses.&nbsp; She was answered
that these were not many in proportion, and that not only had
pew-rents kept them out of church, but that they had little
disposition to go there.&nbsp; They did send their children to
the old endowed charity schools, but as these children grew up,
wave after wave lapsed into a smooth, respectable heathen life of
Sunday pleasuring.&nbsp; The more religious became dissenters,
because the earnest inner life did not approve itself to them in
Church teaching as presented to them; the worse sort, by far the
most numerous, fell lower and lower, and hovered scarcely above
the depths of sin and misery.&nbsp; Drinking was the universal
vice, and dragged many a seemingly steady character into every
stage of degradation.&nbsp; Men and women alike fell under the
temptation, and soon hastened down the descent of corruption and
crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mrs. Parsons, &lsquo;I observed gin
palaces at the corner of every street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.&nbsp; Neither her husband nor Honor made
<!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>any reply.&nbsp; If they had done so, neither of the
young Fulmorts would have perceived any connection between the
gin palaces and their father&rsquo;s profession; but the silence
caused both to raise their eyes.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, judging by
her sisters&rsquo; code of the becoming, fancied that their
friends supposed their feelings might be hurt by alluding to the
distillery, as a trade, and cast about for some cheerful
observations, which she could not find.</p>
<p>Robert had received a new idea, one that must be put aside
till he had time to look at it.</p>
<p>There was a ring at the door.&nbsp; Honor&rsquo;s face lighted
up at the tread on the marble pavement of the hall, and without
other announcement, a young man entered the room, and as she
sprang up to meet him, bent down his lofty head, and kissed her
with half-filial, half-coaxing tenderness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, here I am.&nbsp; They told me I should find you
here.&nbsp; Ah! Ph&oelig;be, I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&nbsp;
Fulmort, how are you?&rsquo; and a well-bred shake of the hand to
Mr. and Mrs. Parsons, with the ease and air of the young master,
returning to his mother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did you come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to-day.&nbsp; I got away sooner than I
expected.&nbsp; I went to Lowndes Square, and they told me I
should find you here, so I came away as soon as dinner was
over.&nbsp; They were dressing for some grand affair, and wanted
me to come with them, but of course I must come to see if you had
really achieved bringing bright Ph&oelig;be from her
orbit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His simile conveyed the astronomical compliment at once to
Honora and Ph&oelig;be, who were content to share it.&nbsp;
Honora was in a condition of subdued excitement and anxiety,
compared to which all other sensations were tame, chequered as
was her felicity, a state well known to mothers and
sisters.&nbsp; Intensely gratified at her darling&rsquo;s
arrival, gladdened by his presence, rejoicing in his endowments,
she yet dreaded every phrase lest some dim misgiving should be
deepened, and watched for the impression he made on her friends,
as though her own depended upon it.</p>
<p>Admiration could not but come foremost.&nbsp; It was pleasant
to look upon such a fine specimen of manly beauty and
vigour.&nbsp; Of unusual height, his form was so well moulded,
that his superior stature was only perceived by comparison with
others, and the proportions were those of great strength.&nbsp;
The small, well-set head, proudly carried, the short, straight
features, and the form of the free massive curls, might have been
a model for the bust of a Greek athlete; the colouring was the
fresh, healthy bronzed ruddiness of English youth, and the
expression had a certain boldness of good-humoured freedom,
agreeing with the quiet power of the whole figure.&nbsp; Those
bright gray eyes could never have been daunted, those curling,
merry lips never at a loss, that smooth brow never been
unwelcome, those easy movements never cramped, nor the manners
restrained by bashfulness.</p>
<p>The contrast was not favourable to Robert.&nbsp; The fair <!--
page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>proportions of the one brought out the irregular build
of the other; the classical face made the plain one more homely,
the erect bearing made the eye turn to the slouching carriage,
and the readiness of address provoked comparison with the awkward
diffidence of one disregarded at home.&nbsp; Bashfulness and
depression had regained their hold of the elder lad almost as the
younger one entered, and in the changes of position consequent
upon the new arrival, he fell into the background, and stood
leaning, caryatid fashion, against the mantelshelf, without
uttering a word, while Owen, in a half-recumbent position on an
ottoman, a little in the rear of Miss Charlecote and her tea
equipage, and close to Ph&oelig;be, indulged in the blithe
loquacity of a return home, in a tone of caressing banter towards
the first lady, of something between good-nature and attention to
the latter, yet without any such exclusiveness as would have been
disregard to the other guests.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ponto well!&nbsp; Poor old Pon! how does he get
on?&nbsp; Was it a very affecting parting,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t see.&nbsp; I met Miss Charlecote at the
station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not even your eyes might intrude on the sacredness of
grief!&nbsp; Well, at least you dried them?&nbsp; But who dried
Ponto&rsquo;s?&rsquo; solemnly turning on Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jones, I hope,&rsquo; said she, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it!&nbsp; Says I to myself, when Henry opened
the door, Jones remains at home for the consolation of
Ponto.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not entirely&mdash;&rsquo; began Honora, laughing; but
the boy shook his head, cutting her short with a playful
frown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cousin Honor, it grieves me to see a woman of your age
and responsibility making false excuses.&nbsp; Mr. Parsons, I
appeal to you, as a clergyman of the Church of England, is it not
painful to hear her putting forward Jones&rsquo;s asthma, when we
all know the true fact is that Ponto&rsquo;s tastes are so
aristocratic that he can&rsquo;t take exercise with an under
servant, and the housekeeper is too fat to waddle.&nbsp; By the
bye, how is the old thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much more effective than might be supposed by your
account, sir, and probably wishing to know whether to get your
room ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My room.&nbsp; Thank you; no, not to-night.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got nothing with me.&nbsp; What are you going to do
to-morrow?&nbsp; I know you are to be at Charteris&rsquo;s to
luncheon; his Jewess told me so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Owen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any shame, if Charles
doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;only if you don&rsquo;t
think yourselves at a stall of cheap jewellery at a
fair&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, take care.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a learned young lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I&rsquo;m very backward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s the fashion to deny it, but mind you
don&rsquo;t mention Shakespeare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you never hear of the <i>Merchant of
Venice</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, a little startled, wanted to hear whether Mrs.
Charteris <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>were really Jewish, and after a
little more in this style, which Honor reasonably feared the
Parsonses might not consider in good taste, it was explained that
her riches were Jewish, though her grandfather had been nothing,
and his family Christian.&nbsp; Owen adding, that but for her
origin, she would be very good-looking; not that he cared for
that style, and his manner indicated that such rosy, childish
charms as were before him had his preference.&nbsp; But though
this was evident enough to all the rest of the world, Ph&oelig;be
did not appear to have the least perception of his personal
meaning, and freely, simply answered, that she admired dark-eyed
people, and should be glad to see Mrs. Charteris.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see her in her glory,&rsquo; said Owen;
&lsquo;Tuesday week, the great concern is to come off, at Castle
Blanch, and a rare sight she&rsquo;ll be!&nbsp; Cilly tells me
she is rehearsing her dresses with different sets of jewels all
the morning, and for ever coming in to consult her and
Rashe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must be rather tiresome,&rsquo; said Honor;
&lsquo;she cannot be much of a companion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy she gets much satisfaction,&rsquo;
said Owen, laughing; &lsquo;Rashe never uses much &ldquo;soft
sawder.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an easy-going place, where you
may do just as you choose, and the young ladies appreciate
liberty.&nbsp; By the bye, what do you think of this Irish
scheme?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora was so much ashamed of it, that she had never mentioned
it even to Ph&oelig;be, and she was the more sorry that it had
been thus adverted to, as she saw Robert intent on what Owen let
fall.&nbsp; She answered shortly, that she could not suppose it
serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serious as a churchyard,&rsquo; was Owen&rsquo;s
answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dare say they will ask Ph&oelig;be to join
the party.&nbsp; For my own part, I never believed in it till I
came up to-day, and found the place full of salmon-flies, and the
start fixed for Wednesday the 24th.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; came a voice from the dark mantelshelf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s the best of it.&nbsp; Who
but my wise sister and Rashe?&nbsp; Not a soul besides,&rsquo;
cried Owen, giving way to laughter, which no one was disposed to
echo.&nbsp; &lsquo;They vow that they will fish all the best
streams, and do more than any crack fisherman going, and they
would like to see who will venture to warn them off.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve tried that already.&nbsp; Last summer what did Lucy
do, but go and fish Sir Harry Buller&rsquo;s water.&nbsp; You
know he&rsquo;s a very tiger about preserving.&nbsp; Well, she
fished coolly on in the face of all his keepers; they stood
aghast, didn&rsquo;t know what manner of Nixie it was, I suppose;
and when Sir Harry came down, foaming at the mouth, she just
shook her curls, and made him wade in up to his knees to get her
fly out of a bramble!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must be exaggerated,&rsquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exaggerated!&nbsp; Not a word!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not
possible to exaggerate Cilly&rsquo;s coolness.&nbsp; I did say
something about going with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must, if they go at all!&rsquo; exclaimed
Honora.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&lsquo;Out of the question, Sweet Honey.&nbsp; They
reject me with disdain, declare that I should only render them
commonplace, and that &ldquo;rich and rare were the gems she
wore&rdquo; would never have got across Ireland safe if she had a
great strapping brother to hamper her.&nbsp; And really, as
Charles says, I don&rsquo;t suppose any damage can well happen to
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora would not talk of it, and turned the conversation to
what was to be done on the following day.&nbsp; Owen eagerly
proffered himself as escort, and suggested all manner of plans,
evidently assuming the entire direction and protection of the two
ladies, who were to meet him at luncheon in Lowndes Square, and
go with him to the Royal Academy, which, as he and Honora agreed,
must necessarily be the earliest object for the sake of providing
innocent conversation.</p>
<p>As soon as the clock struck ten, Robert took leave, and Owen
rose, but instead of going, lingered, talking Oxford with Mr.
Parsons, and telling good stories, much to the ladies&rsquo;
amusement, though increasing Honora&rsquo;s trepidation by the
fear that something in his tone about the authorities, or the
slang of his manner, might not give her friends a very good idea
of his set.&nbsp; The constant fear of what might come next,
absolutely made her impatient for his departure, and at last she
drove him away, by begging to know how he was going all that
distance, and offering to send Henry to call a cab, a thing he
was too good-natured to permit.&nbsp; He bade good night and
departed, while Mr. Parsons, in answer to her eager eyes,
gratified her by pronouncing him a very fine young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is very full of spirit,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You must let me tell you a story of him.&nbsp; They have a
young new schoolmistress at Wrapworth, his father&rsquo;s former
living, you know, close to Castle Blanch.&nbsp; This poor thing
was obliged to punish a school-child, the daughter of one of the
bargemen on the Thames, a huge ruffianly man.&nbsp; Well, a day
or two after, Owen came upon him in a narrow lane, bullying the
poor girl almost out of her life, threatening her, and daring her
to lay a finger on his children.&nbsp; What do you think Owen
did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fought him, I suppose,&rsquo; said Mr. Parsons, judging
by the peculiar delight ladies take in such exploits.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Besides, he has sufficiently the air of a hero to make it
incumbent on him to &ldquo;kill some giant.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We may be content with something short of his killing
the giant,&rsquo; said Honor, &lsquo;but he really did gain the
victory.&nbsp; That lad, under nineteen, positively beat this
great monster of a man, and made him ask the girl&rsquo;s pardon,
knocked him down, and thoroughly mastered him!&nbsp; I should
have known nothing of it, though, if Owen had not got a black
eye, which made him unpresentable for the Castle Blanch gaieties,
so he came down to the Holt to me, knowing I should not mind
wounds gained in a good cause.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They wished her good night in her triumph.</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>The receipt of a letter was rare and supreme felicity
to Maria; therefore to indite one was Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s first
task on the morrow; after which she took up her book, and was
deeply engaged, when the door flew back, and the voice of Owen
Sandbrook exclaimed, &lsquo;Goddess of the silver bow! what,
alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote is with her lawyer, and Robert at the
office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The parson and parsoness parsonically gone to study
parsonages, schools, and dilapidations, I suppose.&nbsp; What a
bore it is having them here; I&rsquo;d have taken up my quarters
here, otherwise, but I can&rsquo;t stand parish
politics.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like them very much,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;and Miss Charlecote seems to be happy with
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just her cut, dear old thing; the same honest,
illogical, practical sincerity,&rsquo; said Owen, in a tone of
somewhat superior melancholy; but seeing Ph&oelig;be about to
resent his words as a disrespectful imputation on their friend,
he turned the subject, addressing Ph&oelig;be in the manner
between teasing and flattering, habitual to a big schoolboy
towards a younger child, phases of existence which each had not
so long outgrown as to have left off the mutual habits thereto
belonging.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what is bright Cynthia doing?&nbsp;
Writing verses, I declare!&mdash;worthy sister of Phoebus
Apollo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only notes,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, relinquishing her
paper, in testimony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When found make a note of&mdash;Summoned by
writ&mdash;temp. Ed. III.&mdash;burgesses&mdash;knights of
shire.&nbsp; It reads like an act of parliament.&nbsp;
Hallam&rsquo;s English Constitution.&nbsp; My eyes!&nbsp; By way
of lighter study.&nbsp; It is quite appalling.&nbsp; Pray what
may be the occupation of your more serious moments?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see the worst I have with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Holiday recreation, to which you can just
condescend.&nbsp; I say, Ph&oelig;be, I have a great curiosity to
understand the Zend.&nbsp; I wish you would explain it to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I ever read it,&rsquo; began Ph&oelig;be,
laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, you pretend to deny?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t put me
off that way.&nbsp; A lady who can only unbend so far as to the
English Constitution by way of recreation, must&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not by way of recreation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, I know my respected cousin too well to imagine
she would have imposed such a task.&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t do,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never said she had, but Miss Fennimore desired
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall appeal.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no act of tyranny a
woman in authority will not commit.&nbsp; But this is a free
country, Ph&oelig;be, as maybe you have gathered from your
author, and unless her trammels have reached to your
soul&mdash;&rsquo; and he laid his hand on the book to take it
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps they have,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, smiling,
but holding it fast, &lsquo;for I shall be much more comfortable
in doing as I was told.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Owen, pretending to scrutinize her
as if she <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>were something extraordinary (really
as an excuse for a good gaze upon her pure complexion and limpid
eyes, so steady, childlike, and unabashed, free from all such
consciousness as would make them shrink from the playful
look).&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Now, in my experience the
comfort would be in the <i>not</i> doing as you were
told.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but you know I have no spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to heaven other people had none!&rsquo; cried
Owen, suddenly changing his tone, and sitting down opposite to
Ph&oelig;be, his elbow on the table, and speaking
earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would give the world that my sister
were like you.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of anything so
preposterous as this Irish business?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She cannot think of it, when Miss Charlecote has told
her of all the objections,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will go the more,&rsquo; returned Owen.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I say to you, Ph&oelig;be, what I would say to no one
else.&nbsp; Lucilla&rsquo;s treatment of Honora Charlecote is
abominable&mdash;vexes me more than I can say.&nbsp; They say
some nations have no words for gratitude.&nbsp; One would think
she had come of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be looked much shocked, but said, &lsquo;Perhaps Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s kindness has seemed to her like a matter of
course, not as it does to us, who have no claim at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had no claim,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;the
connection is nothing, absolutely nothing.&nbsp; I believe, poor
dear, the attraction was that she had once been attached to my
father, and he was too popular a preacher to <i>keep</i> well as
a lover.&nbsp; Well, there were we, a couple of orphans, a
nuisance to all our kith and kin&mdash;nobody with a bit of mercy
for us but that queer old coon, Kit Charteris, when she takes us
home, treats us like her own children, feels for us as much as
the best mother living could; undertakes to provide for us.&nbsp;
Now, I put it to you, Ph&oelig;be, has she any right to be cast
off in this fashion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know in what fashion you mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you seen how Cilly
has run restive from babyhood?&nbsp; A pretty termagant she was,
as even I can remember.&nbsp; And how my poor father spoilt
her!&nbsp; Any one but Honor would have given her up, rather than
have gone through what she did, so firmly and patiently, till she
had broken her in fairly well.&nbsp; But then come in these
Charterises, and Cilly runs frantic after them, her own
<i>dear</i> relations.&nbsp; Much they had cared for us when we
were troublesome little pests.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s all the force
of blood.&nbsp; Stuff!&nbsp; The whole truth is that they are
gay, and Honora quiet; they encourage her to run riot.&nbsp;
Honora keeps her in order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you spoken to her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As well speak to the wind.&nbsp; She thinks it a great
favour to run down to Hiltonbury for the Horticultural Show, turn
everything topsy-turvy, keep poor dear Sweet Honey in a perpetual
ferment, then come away to Castle Blanch, as if she were rid of a
troublesome duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&lsquo;I thought Miss Charlecote sent Lucy to enjoy
herself!&nbsp; We always said how kind and self-denying she
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Denied, rather,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;only
that&rsquo;s her way of carrying it off.&nbsp; A month or two in
the season might be very well; see the world, and get the tone of
it; but to racket about with Ratia, and leave Honor alone for
months together, is too strong for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora came in, delighted at her boy&rsquo;s visit, and well
pleased at the manner in which he was engrossed.&nbsp; Two such
children needed no chaperon, and if that sweet crescent moon were
to be his guiding light, so much the better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Capital girl, that,&rsquo; he said, as she left the
room.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a noble achievement of
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In getting my youngest princess out of the
castle.&nbsp; Ay! I do feel in a beneficent enchanter&rsquo;s
position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has grown up much prettier than she promised to
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And far too good for a Fulmort.&nbsp; But that is
Robert&rsquo;s doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Robert! how he shows the old distiller in
grain.&nbsp; So he is taking to the old shop?&mdash;best thing
for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only by way of experiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pleasant experiment to make as much as old
Fulmort!&nbsp; I wish he&rsquo;d take me into
partnership.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, Owen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not proud.&nbsp; These aren&rsquo;t the days when
it matters how a man gets his tin, so he knows what to do with
it.&nbsp; Ay! the world gets beyond the dear old Hiltonbury
views, after all, Sweet Honey, and you see what City atmosphere
does to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I never wished to press any choice on
you,&rsquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; with a good-humoured air of affront,
&lsquo;you thought me serious?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know
I&rsquo;m the ninth, instead of the nineteenth-century man, under
your wing?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d promise you to be a bishop, only, you
see, I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t be mediocre
enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Owen!&rsquo; and yet she smiled.&nbsp; That
boy&rsquo;s presence and caressing sweetness towards herself were
the greatest bliss to her, almost beyond that of a mother with a
son, because more uncertain, less her right by nature.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be came down as the carriage was at the door, and
they called in Whittington Street for her brother, but he only
came out to say he was very busy, and would not intrude on Mrs.
Charteris&mdash;bashfulness for which he was well abused on the
way to Lowndes Square.</p>
<p>Owen, with his air of being at home, put aside the servants as
they entered the magnificent house, replete with a display of
state and luxury analogous to that of Beauchamp, but with better
taste and greater ease.&nbsp; The Fulmorts were in bondage to
ostentation; the Charterises were lavish for their own enjoyment,
and heedless alike of cost and of appearance.</p>
<p>The great drawing-room was crowded with furniture, and the
splendid marqueterie tables and crimson ottomans were piled with
a wild confusion of books, prints, periodicals, papers, and <!--
page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>caricatures, heaped over ornaments and bijouterie, and
beyond, at the doorway of a second room, even more
miscellaneously filled, a small creature sprang to meet them,
kissing Honora, and exclaiming, &lsquo;Here you are!&nbsp; Have
you brought the pig&rsquo;s wool?&nbsp; Ah! but you&rsquo;ve
brought something else!&nbsp; No&mdash;what&rsquo;s become of
that Redbreast!&rsquo; as she embraced Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was so busy that he could not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ill-behaved bird; a whole month without coming near
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a week,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, speaking less
freely, as she perceived two strangers in the room, a gentleman
in moustaches, who shook hands with Owen, and a lady, whom from
her greeting to Miss Charlecote (for introductions were not the
way of the house) she concluded to be the formidable Rashe, and
therefore regarded with some curiosity.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had expected her to be a large masculine woman,
and was surprised at her dapper proportions and not ungraceful
manner.&nbsp; Her face, neither handsome nor the reverse, was one
that neither in features nor complexion revealed her age, and her
voice was pitched to the tones of good society, so that but for a
certain &lsquo;don&rsquo;t care&rsquo; sound in her words, and a
defiant freedom of address, Ph&oelig;be would have set down all
she had heard as a mistake, in spite of the table covered with
the brilliant appliances of fly-making, over which both she and
Lucilla were engaged.&nbsp; It was at the period when ladies
affected coats and waistcoats, and both cousins followed the
fashion to the utmost; wearing tightly-fitting black coats, plain
linen collars, and shirt-like under-sleeves, with black ties
round the neck.&nbsp; Horatia was still in mourning for her
mother, and wore a black skirt, but Lucilla&rsquo;s was of rich
deep gentianella-coloured silk, and the buttons of her white vest
were of beautiful coral.&nbsp; The want of drapery gave a
harshness to Miss Charteris&rsquo;s appearance, but the little
masculine affectations only rendered Lucy&rsquo;s miniature style
of feminine beauty still more piquant.&nbsp; Less tall than many
girls of fourteen, she was exquisitely formed; the close-fitting
dress became her taper waist, the ivory fairness of the throat
and hands shone out in their boyish setting, and the soft
delicacy of feature and complexion were enhanced by the vivid
sparkling of those porcelain blue eyes, under the long lashes,
still so fair and glossy as to glisten in the light, like her
profuse flaxen tresses, arranged in a cunning wilderness of
plaits and natural ringlets.&nbsp; The great charm was the
minuteness and refinement of the mould containing the energetic
spirit that glanced in her eyes, quivered on her lips, and
pervaded every movement of the elastic feet and hands, childlike
in size, statue-like in symmetry, elfin in quickness and
dexterity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lucile la F&eacute;e,&rsquo; she might
well have been called, as she sat manipulating the gorgeous silk
and feathers with an essential strength and firmness of hands
such as could hardly have been expected from such small members,
and producing such lovely specimens that nothing seemed wanting
but a touch <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of her wand to endow them with
life.&nbsp; It was fit fairy work, and be it farther known, that
few women are capable of it; they seldom have sufficient accuracy
of sustained attention and firmness of finger combined, to
produce anything artistic or durable, and the accomplishment was
therefore Lucilla&rsquo;s pride.&nbsp; Her cousin could prepare
materials, but could not finish.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you brought
the pig&rsquo;s wool?&rsquo; repeated Lucy, as they sat
down.&nbsp; &lsquo;No?&nbsp; That <i>is</i> a cruel way of
testifying.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t find a scrap of that shade,
though I&rsquo;ve nearly broke my heart in the tackle
shops.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my last fragment, and this butcher will
be a wreck for want of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; quoth the gentleman, bending over
with an air of intimacy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may see,&rsquo; returned Lucilla, &lsquo;but that
will do no good.&nbsp; Owen got this at a little shop at
Elverslope, and we can only conclude that the father of orange
pigs is dead, for we&rsquo;ve tried every maker, and can&rsquo;t
hit off the tint.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it in a shop in the Strand,&rsquo; he
said, with an air of depreciation, such as set both ladies off
with an ardour inexplicable to mere spectators, both vehemently
defending the peculiarity of their favourite hue, and little
personalities passing, exceedingly diverting apparently to both
parties, but which vexed Honora and dismayed Ph&oelig;be by the
coolness of the gentleman, and the ease with which he was treated
by the ladies.</p>
<p>Luncheon was announced in the midst, and in the dining-room
they found Miss Charteris, a dark, aquiline beauty, of
highly-coloured complexion, such as permitted the glowing hues of
dress and ornament in which she delighted, and large languid dark
eyes of Oriental appearance.</p>
<p>In the scarlet and gold net confining her sable locks, her
ponderous earrings, her massive chains and bracelets, and
gorgeous silk, she was a splendid ornament at the head of the
table; but she looked sleepily out from under her black-fringed
eyelids, turned over the carving as a matter of course to Owen,
and evidently regarded the two young ladies as bound to take all
trouble off her hands in talking, arranging, or settling what she
should do with herself or her carriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lolly shall take you there,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lolly
shall call for that,&rsquo; passed between the cousins without
the smallest reference to Lolly herself (otherwise Elo&iuml;sa),
who looked serenely indifferent through all the plans proposed
for her, only once exerting her will sufficiently to say,
&lsquo;Very well, Rashe, dear, you&rsquo;ll tell the
coachman&mdash;only don&rsquo;t forget that I must go to Storr
and Mortimer&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora expressed a hope that Lucilla would come with her party
to the Exhibition, and was not pleased that Mr. Calthorp
exclaimed that there was another plan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Mr. Calthorp, I never said any such
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charteris, is not that a little too
strong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You told me of the Dorking,&rsquo; cried Lucilla,
&lsquo;and you said <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>you would not miss the sight for
anything; but I never said you should have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rashe meanwhile clapped her hands with exultation, and there
was a regular chatter of eager voices&mdash;&lsquo;I should like
to know how you would get the hackles out of a suburban poultry
fancier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of him?&mdash;no, out of his best Dorking.&nbsp;
Priced at &pound;120 last exhibition&mdash;two years
old&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t take &pound;200 for him now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;ve seen
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo;&nbsp; Lucilla opened a paper, and waved
triumphantly five of the long tippet-plumes of chanticleer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mean!&nbsp; I more than mean!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you
tell us that you had been to see the old party on business, and
had spied the hackles walking about in his yard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I had hoped to introduce you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if we needed that!&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; Rashe, and I
started off at six o&rsquo;clock this morning, to shake off the
remains of the ball, rode down to Brompton, and did our
work.&nbsp; No, it was not like the macaw business, I
declare.&nbsp; The old gentleman held the bird for us himself,
and I promised him a dried salmon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I had flattered myself&mdash;it was an unfair
advantage, Miss Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least.&nbsp; Had you gone, it would have
cast a general clumsiness over the whole transaction, and not
left the worthy old owner half so well satisfied.&nbsp; I believe
you had so little originality as to expect to engage him in
conversation while I captured the bird; but once was enough of
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could not help asking what was meant; and it was
explained that, while a call was being made on a certain old lady
with a blue and yellow macaw, Lucilla had contrived to abstract
the prime glory of the creature&rsquo;s tail&mdash;a blue feather
lined with yellow&mdash;an irresistible charm to a
fisherwoman.&nbsp; But here even the tranquil Elo&iuml;sa
murmured that Cilly must never do so again when she went out with
<span class="smcap">her</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Lolly, indeed I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I prefer
honesty, I assure you, except when it is too commonplace.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll meddle with nothing at Madame Sonnini&rsquo;s this
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you cannot come with us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you see, Honor, here have Rashe and I been
appointed band-masters, Lord Chamberlains, masters of the
ceremonies, major-domos, and I don&rsquo;t know what, to all the
Castle Blanch concern; and as Rashe neither knows nor cares about
music, I&rsquo;ve got all that on my hands; and I must take Lolly
to look on while I manage the programme.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you too busy to find a day to spend with us at St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A discussion of engagements took place, apparently at the rate
of five per day; but Mrs. Charteris interposed an invitation to
dinner for the next evening, including Robert; and farther it
appeared that all the three were expected to take part <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>in
the Castle Blanch festivities.&nbsp; Lolly had evidently been
told of them as settled certainties among the guests, and
Lucilla, Owen, and Rashe vied with each other in declaring that
they had imagined Honor to have brought Ph&oelig;be to London
with no other intent, and that all was fixed for the ladies to
sleep at Castle Blanch the night before, and Robert Fulmort to
come down in the morning by train.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been farther from Honora&rsquo;s
predilections than such gaieties, but Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eyes
were growing round with eagerness, and there would be unkindness
in denying her the pleasure, as well as churlishness in
disappointing Lucy and Owen, who had reckoned on her in so
gratifying a manner.&nbsp; Without decidedly accepting or
refusing, she let the talk go on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fulmort,&rsquo; said Ratia, &lsquo;I hope you are
not too religious to dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Much surprised, Ph&oelig;be made some reply in the
negative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I forgot, that&rsquo;s not your sisters&rsquo;
line; but I thought . . . &rsquo; and she gave an expressive
glance to indicate Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; again said Ph&oelig;be, decidedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I understand.&nbsp; Never mind, I ought to have
remembered; but when people are <i>gone in</i>, one is apt to
forget whether they think &ldquo;promiscuous dancing&rdquo;
immoral or praiseworthy.&nbsp; Well, you must know some of my
brother&rsquo;s constituents are alarmingly excellent&mdash;fat,
suburban, and retired; and we have hatched a juvenile hay-making,
where they may eat and flirt without detriment to decided piety;
and when they go off, we dress for a second instalment for an
evening party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Ph&oelig;be it sounded like opening Paradise, and she
listened anxiously for the decision; but nothing appeared certain
except the morrow&rsquo;s dinner, and that Lucilla was to come to
spend the Sunday at Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s; and this being
fixed, the luncheon party broke up, with such pretty bright
affection on Lucilla&rsquo;s part, such merry coaxing of Honor,
and such orders to Ph&oelig;be to &lsquo;catch that Robin
to-morrow,&rsquo; that there was no room left for the sense of
disappointment that no rational word had passed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Owen, getting into the
carriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Henry knows&mdash;the Royal Academy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! no alteration in consequence of the invitation? no
finery required? you must not carry Hiltonbury philosophy
<i>too</i> far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not accepted it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not required; it is your fate, Ph&oelig;be; why
don&rsquo;t you speak, or are you under an embargo from any of
the wicked enchanters?&nbsp; Even if so, you might be got off
among the pious juveniles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa was so kind as to say I might go wherever Miss
Charlecote liked,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but, indeed, I
had rather do exactly what suits her; I dare say the morning
party will suit her best&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The oily popular preachers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Owen,&rsquo; laughed Honor.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>&lsquo;No, now you must accept the whole.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s room to give the preachers a wide berth, even
should they insist on &ldquo;concluding with prayer,&rdquo; and
it will be a pretty sight.&nbsp; They have the Guards&rsquo; band
coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never heard a military band,&rsquo; ejaculated
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there are to be sports for the village children, I
believe,&rsquo; added Owen; &lsquo;besides, you will like to meet
some of the lions&mdash;the Archdeacon and his wife will be
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how can I think of filling up Mrs.
Charteris&rsquo;s house, without the least
acquaintance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honey-sweet philosopher, Elo&iuml;sa heeds as little
how her house is filled, so it <i>be</i> filled, as Jessica did
her father&rsquo;s ring.&nbsp; Five dresses a day, with
accoutrements to match, and for the rest she is sublimely
indifferent.&nbsp; Fortune played her a cruel trick in preventing
her from being born a fair sultana.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to be a Mahometan?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine she is far removed from
one;&rsquo; then, as Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s horror made her look
like Maria, he added&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t mean that she was
not bred a Christian, but the Oriental mind never distinctly
embraces tenets contrary to its constitution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote, is he talking in earnest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; Honora said, a little severely,
&lsquo;for he would be giving a grievous account of the poor
lady&rsquo;s faith&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith! no, my dear, she has not reflection enough for
faith.&nbsp; All that enters into the Eastern female mind is a
little observance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are not going to lead Ph&oelig;be to believe
that you think it indifferent whether those observances be
Christian or Pagan?&rsquo; said Honora, earnestly.</p>
<p>There was a little pause, and then Owen rather hesitatingly
said&mdash;&lsquo;It is a hard thing to pronounce that
three-fifths of one&rsquo;s fellow-creatures are on the high road
to Erebus, especially when ethnologically we find that certain
aspects of doctrine never have approved themselves to certain
races, and that climate is stronger than creed.&nbsp; Am I not
talking Fennimorically, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much more Fennimorically than I wish her to hear, or
you to speak,&rsquo; said Honora; &lsquo;you talk as if there
were no such thing as truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! now comes the question of subjective and objective,
and I was as innocent as possible of any intention of plunging
into such a sea, or bringing those furrows into your forehead,
dear Honor!&nbsp; See what it is to talk to you and Miss
Fennimore&rsquo;s pupil.&nbsp; All things, human and divine, have
arisen out of my simple endeavour to show you that you must come
to Castle Blanch, the planners of the feast having so ordained,
and it being good for all parties, due from the fairy godmother
to the third princess, and seriously giving Cilly another chance
of returning within the bounds of discretion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora thought as much.&nbsp; She hoped that Robert would by
that time have assumed his right to plead with Lucilla, and that
in such a case she should be a welcome refuge, and Ph&oelig;be
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>still more indispensable; so her lips opened in a
yielding smile, and Ph&oelig;be thanked her rapturously, vague
hopes of Robert&rsquo;s bliss adding zest to the anticipation of
the lifting of the curtain which hid the world of brightness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s still time,&rsquo; said Owen, with his
hand on the check-string; &lsquo;which do you patronize?&nbsp;
Redmayne or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; smiled Honor, &lsquo;we can&rsquo;t
waste our escort upon women&rsquo;s work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladies never want a gentleman more than when their
taste is to be directed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is afraid to trust us, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conscience has spoken,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;she
knows how she would go and disguise herself in an old
dowager&rsquo;s gown to try to look like sixty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for silk gowns&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I positively forbid it,&rsquo; he cried, cutting her
short; &lsquo;it is five years old!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A reason why I should not have another too grand to
wear out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you never ought to have had it.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be,
it was bought when Lucy was seventeen, on purpose to look as if
she was of a fit age for a wall-flower, and so well has the poor
thing done its duty, that Lucy hears herself designated as the
pretty girl who belongs to the violet and white!&nbsp; If she had
known <i>that</i> was coming after her, I won&rsquo;t answer for
the consequence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it <i>does</i> annoy Lucy&mdash;we do not so often
go out together&mdash;don&rsquo;t, Owen, I never said it was to
be now, I am bent on Landseer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I said so,&rsquo; returned Owen, &lsquo;for Miss
Charlecote regards the distressed dressmakers&mdash;four
dresses&mdash;think of the fingers that must ache over
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he does what he pleases,&rsquo; sighed Honor;
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s no help for it, you see, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
Shall you dislike looking on?&rsquo;&nbsp; For she doubted
whether Ph&oelig;be had been provided with means for her
equipment, and might not require delay and correspondence but the
frank answer was, &lsquo;Thank you, I shall be glad of the
opportunity.&nbsp; Papa told me I might fit myself out in case of
need.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And suppose we are too late for the
Exhibition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never bought a dress before,&rsquo; quoth
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>Owen laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,
Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; Be strong-minded and original enough to own
that some decorations surpass &ldquo;Raffaelles, Correggios, and
stuff&rdquo;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, simply, and with no
affectation of scorn, &lsquo;they only interest me more at this
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor smiled to Owen her love for the honesty that never spoke
for effect, nor took what it believed it ought to feel, for what
it really felt.&nbsp; Withal, Owen gained his purpose, and
conducted the two ladies into one of the great shops of ladies
apparel.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be followed Miss Charlecote with eyes of lively
anticipation.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore had taught her to be
<i>real</i> when she <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>could not be philosophical, and
scruples as to the &lsquo;vain pomp and glory of the world&rsquo;
had not presented themselves; she only found herself admitted to
privileges hitherto so jealously withheld as to endow them with a
factitious value, and in a scene of real beauty.&nbsp; The
textures, patterns, and tints were, as Owen observed, such as
approved themselves to the &aelig;sthetic sense, the miniature
embroidery of the brocades was absolute art, and no contemptible
taste was displayed in the apparently fortuitous yet really
elaborate groupings of rich and delicate hues, fine folds, or
ponderous draperies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Far from it,&rsquo; said Honor; &lsquo;the only doubt
is whether such be a worthy application of &aelig;sthetics.&nbsp;
Were they not given us for better uses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To diffuse the widest amount of happiness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is one purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a fair woman well dressed is the sight most
delightful to the greatest number of beholders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor made a playful face of utter repudiation of the maxim,
but meeting him on his own ground emphasized &lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Fair</span> and <span class="smcap">well</span>
dressed&mdash;that is, appropriately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what brings me here, said Owen, turning round,
as the changeful silks, already asked for, were laid on the
counter before them.</p>
<p>It was an amusing shopping.&nbsp; The gentleman&rsquo;s object
was to direct the taste of both ladies, but his success was not
the same.&nbsp; Honora&rsquo;s first affections fell upon a
handsome black, enlivened by beautiful blue flowers in the
flounces; but her tyrant scouted it as a &lsquo;dingy
dowager,&rsquo; and overruled her into choosing a delicate
lavender, insisting that if it were less durable, so much the
better for her friends, and domineering over the black lace
accompaniments with a solemn tenderness that made her warn him in
a whisper that people were taking her for his ancient bride, thus
making him some degrees more drolly attentive; settling her
head-gear with the lady of the shop, without reference to
her.&nbsp; After all, it was very charming to be so
affectionately made a fool of, and it was better for her children
as well as due to the house of Charlecote that she should not be
a dowdy country cousin.</p>
<p>Meantime, Ph&oelig;be stood by amused, admiring, assisting,
but not at all bewildered.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore had impressed the
maxim; &lsquo;Always know what you mean to do, and do
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She had never chosen a dress before, but that
did not hinder her from having a mind and knowing it; she had a
reply for each silk that Owen suggested, and the moment her turn
came, she desired to see a green glac&eacute;.&nbsp; In vain he
exclaimed, and drew his favourites in front of her, in vain
appealed to Miss Charlecote and the shopman; she laughed him off,
took but a moment to reject each proffered green which did not
please her, and in as brief a space had recognized the true
delicate pale tint of ocean.&nbsp; It was one that few
complexions could have borne, but <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>their
connoisseur, with one glance from it to her fresh cheek, owned
her right, though much depended on the garniture, and he again
brought forward his beloved lilac, insinuating that he should
regard her selection of it as a personal attention.&nbsp; No; she
laughed, and said she had made up her mind and would not change;
and while he was presiding over Honora&rsquo;s black lace, she
was beforehand with him, and her bill was being made out for her
white muslin worked mantle, white bonnet with a tuft of lady
grass, white evening dress, and wreath of lilies of the
valley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Green and white, forsaken quite,&rsquo; was the best
revenge that occurred to him, and Miss Charlecote declared
herself ashamed that the old lady&rsquo;s dress had caused so
much more fuss than the young lady&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It was of course too late for the Exhibition, so they applied
themselves to further shopping, until Owen had come to the
farthest point whence he could conveniently walk back to dine
with his cousins, and go with them to the opera, and he expended
some vituperation upon Ratia for an invitation which had
prevented Ph&oelig;be from being asked to join the party.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was happy enough without it, and though not
morbidly bashful, felt that at present it was more comfortable to
be under Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s wing than that of Lucilla, and
that the quiet evening was more composing than fresh scenes of
novelty.</p>
<p>The Woolstone-lane world was truly very different from that of
which she had had a glimpse, and quite as new to her.&nbsp; Mr.
Parsons, after his partial survey, was considering of
possibilities, or more truly of endeavours at impossibilities, a
mission to that dreadful population, means of discovering their
sick, of reclaiming their children, of causing the true Light to
shine in that frightful gross darkness that covered the
people.&nbsp; She had never heard anything yet discussed save on
the principle of self-pleasing or self-aggrandizement; here,
self-spending was the axiom on which all the problems were
worked.</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. Parsons retired into the study, and while
his wife and Miss Charlecote sat down for a friendly gossip over
the marriages of the two daughters, Ph&oelig;be welcomed an
unrestrained <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with her
brother.&nbsp; They were one on either seat of the old oriel
window, she, with her work on her lap, full of pleasant things to
tell him, but pausing as she looked up, and saw his eyes far far
away, as he knelt on the cushion, his elbows on the sill of the
open lattice, one hand supporting his chin, the other slowly
erecting his hair into the likeness of the fretful
porcupine.&nbsp; He had heard of, but barely assented to, the
morrow&rsquo;s dinner, or the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> at Castle Blanch;
he had not even asked her how Lucilla looked; and after waiting
for some time, she said, as a feeler&mdash;&lsquo;You go with us
to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I must.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy said so much in her pretty way about catching the
robin, that I am sure she was vexed at your not having
called.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer: his eyes had not come home.</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Presently he mumbled something so much distorted by the
compression of his chin, and by his face being out of window,
that his sister could not make it out.&nbsp; In answer to her
sound of inquiry, he took down one hand, removed the other from
his temple, and emitting a modicum more voice from between his
teeth, said, &lsquo;It is plain&mdash;it can&rsquo;t
be&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can&rsquo;t be?&nbsp; Not&mdash;Lucy?&rsquo;
gasped Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t take shares in the business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her look of relief moved him to explain, and drawing himself
in, he sat down on his own window-seat, stretching a leg across,
and resting one foot upon that where she was placed, so as to
form a sort of barrier, shutting themselves into a sense of
privacy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;not if
my bread depended on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have looked into the books, I have gone over it with
Rawlins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that we are going to be
ruined?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better that we were than to go on as we do!&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, it is wickedness.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a long
pause.&nbsp; Robert rested his brow on his hand, Ph&oelig;be
gazed intently at him, trying to unravel the idea so suddenly
presented.&nbsp; She had reasoned it out before he looked up, and
she roused him by softly saying, &lsquo;You mean that you do not
like the manufacture of spirits because they produce so much
evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though he did not raise his head, she understood his
affirmation, and went on with her quiet logic, for, poor girl,
hers was not the happy maiden&rsquo;s defence&mdash;&lsquo;What
my father does cannot be wrong.&rsquo;&nbsp; Without condemning
her father, she instinctively knew that weapon was not in her
armoury, and could only betake herself to the merits of the
case.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know how much rather I would see you a
clergyman, dear Robin,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but I do not
understand why you change your mind.&nbsp; We always knew that
spirits were improperly used, but that is no reason why none
should be made, and they are often necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;but, Ph&oelig;be, I
have learnt to-day that our trade is not supported by the lawful
use of spirits.&nbsp; It is the ministry of hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be raised her startled eyes in astonished
inquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would have credited nothing short of the books, but
there I find that not above a fifth part of our manufacture goes
to respectable houses, where it is applied properly.&nbsp; The
profitable traffic, which it is the object to extend, is the
supply of the gin palaces of the city.&nbsp; The leases of most
of those you see about here belong to the firm, it supplies them,
and gains enormously on their receipts.&nbsp; It is to extend the
dealings in this way that my legacy is demanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The enormity only gradually beginning to dawn upon
Ph&oelig;be, all she said was a meditative&mdash;&lsquo;You would
not like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not realize it,&rsquo; he said, nettled at her
quiet tone.&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>&lsquo;Do not you understand?&nbsp;
You and I, and all of us, have eaten and drunk, been taught more
than we could learn, lived in a fine house, and been made into
ladies and gentlemen, all by battening on the vice and misery of
this wretched population.&nbsp; Those unhappy men and women are
lured into the gaudy palaces at the corners of the streets to
purchase a moment&rsquo;s oblivion of conscience, by stinting
their children of bread, that we may wear fine clothes, and call
ourselves county people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not talk so, Robert,&rsquo; she exclaimed,
trembling; &lsquo;it cannot be right to say such
things&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only the bare fact! it is no pleasure to me to
accuse my own father, I assure you, Ph&oelig;be, but I cannot
blind myself to the simple truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He cannot see it in that light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He <i>will</i> not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; faltered Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;it cannot
be so bad when one does not know it is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So far true.&nbsp; The conscience does not waken
quickly to evils with which our lives have been long
familiar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Mervyn was brought up to it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not my concern,&rsquo; said Robert, too much in
the tone of &lsquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will at least tell your reasons for
refusing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and much I shall be heeded!&nbsp; However, my own
hands shall be pure from the wages of iniquity.&nbsp; I am
thankful that all I have comes from the Mervyns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a comfort, at least, that you see your
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose it is;&rsquo; but he sighed heavily, with a
sense that it was almost profanation to have set such a
profession in the balance against the sacred ministry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know <i>she</i> will like it best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dear Ph&oelig;be! in spite of Miss Fennimore, faith must still
have been much stronger than reason if she could detect the model
parsoness in yonder firefly.</p>
<p>Poor child, she went to bed, pondering over her
brother&rsquo;s terrible discoveries, and feeling as though she
had suddenly awakened to find herself implicated in a web of
iniquity; her delightful parcel of purchases lost their charms,
and oppressed her as she thought of them in connection with the
rags of the squalid children the rector had described, and she
felt as if there were no escape, and she could never be happy
again under the knowledge of the price of her luxuries, and the
dread of judgment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much good had their wealth done
them,&rsquo; as Robert truly said.&nbsp; The house of Beauchamp
had never been nearly so happy as if their means had been
moderate.&nbsp; Always paying court to their own station, or they
were disunited among themselves, and not yet amalgamated with the
society to which they had attained, the younger ones passing
their elders in cultivation, and every discomfort of change of
position felt, though not acknowledged.&nbsp; Even the mother,
lady as she was by birth, <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>had only
belonged to the second-rate class of gentry, and while elevated
by wealth, was lowered by connection, and not having either mind
or strength enough to stand on her own ground, trod with an
ill-assured foot on that to which she aspired.</p>
<p>Not that all this crossed Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;
There was merely a dreary sense of depression, and of living in
the midst of a grievous mistake, from which Robert alone had the
power of disentangling himself, and she fell asleep sadly enough;
but, fortunately, sins, committed neither by ourselves, nor by
those for whom we are responsible, have not a lasting power of
paining; and she rose up in due time to her own calm sunshiny
spirit of anticipation of the evening&rsquo;s meeting between
Robin and Lucy&mdash;to say nothing of her own first
dinner-party.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<blockquote><p>And instead of &lsquo;dearest Miss,&rsquo;<br />
Jewel, honey, sweetheart, bliss,<br />
And those forms of old admiring,<br />
Call her cockatrice and siren.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C.
Lamb</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ladies of the house were going to a ball, and were in full
costume: Elo&iuml;sa a study for the Arabian Nights, and Lucilla
in an azure gossamer-like texture surrounding her like a cloud,
turquoises on her arms, and blue and silver ribbons mingled with
her blonde tresses.</p>
<p>Very like the clergyman&rsquo;s wife!</p>
<p>O sage Honor, were you not provoked with yourself for being so
old as to regard that bewitching sprite, and marvel whence comes
the cost of those robes of the woof of Faerie?</p>
<p>Let Oberon pay Titania&rsquo;s bills.</p>
<p>That must depend on who Oberon is to be.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, to whom a doubt on that score would have appeared
high treason, nevertheless hated the presence of Mr. Calthorp as
much as she could hate anything, and was in restless anxiety as
to Titania&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; She herself had no cause to
complain, for she was at once singled out and led away from Miss
Charlecote, to be shown some photographic performances, in which
Lucy and her cousin had been dabbling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, that horrid monster is Owen&mdash;he never will
come out respectable.&nbsp; Mr. Prendergast, he is better,
because you don&rsquo;t see his face.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s our
school, Edna Murrell and all; I flatter myself that <i>is</i> a
work of art; only this little wretch fidgeted, and muddled
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that the mistress?&nbsp; She does not look like
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not like Sally Page?&nbsp; No; she would bewilder the
Hiltonbury mind.&nbsp; I mean you to see her; I would not miss
the shock to Honor.&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t show it to her!&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t have any preparation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you call that preparation?&rsquo; said Owen, coming
up, and <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>taking up the photograph
indignantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You should not do such things,
Cilly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t I that do them&mdash;it&rsquo;s
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s brother&mdash;the one in the sky I mean, Dan
Ph&oelig;bus, and if he won&rsquo;t flatter, I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; No, no, I&rsquo;ll not have it broken; it is an exact
likeness of all the children&rsquo;s spotted frocks, and if it be
not of Edna, it ought to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, Robert,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, as she saw him
standing shy, grave, and monumental, with nervous hands clasped
over the back of a chair, neither advancing nor retreating,
&lsquo;what a beautiful place this is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s from a print&mdash;Glendalough!&nbsp;
I mean to bring you plenty of the real place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kathleen&rsquo;s Cave,&rsquo; said the unwelcome
millionaire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, with a comment on Kathleen&rsquo;s
awkwardness!&nbsp; I should like to see the hermit who could push
me down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never tread in Kathleen&rsquo;s
steps!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I shan&rsquo;t find a hermit in the
cave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Talk of skylarking on &ldquo;the lake whose gloomy
shore!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; They all laughed except the two
Fulmorts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a simpler reason,&rsquo; said one of the
Guardsmen, &lsquo;namely, that neither party will be there at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not the saint&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor the lady.&nbsp; Miss Charteris tells me all the
maiden aunts are come up from the country.&rsquo;&nbsp; (How
angry Ph&oelig;be was!)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happily it is an article I don&rsquo;t
possess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we will not differ about technicalities, as long
as the fact is the same.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll remember my words
when you are kept on a diet of Hannah More and Miss Edgeworth
till you shall have abjured hounds, balls, and
salmon-flies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The woman lives not who has the power!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What bet will you take, Miss Sandbrook?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What bet will you take, Lord William, that, maiden
aunts and all, I appear on the 3rd, in a dress of
salmon-flies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hat trimmed with goose feathers to a
pocket-handkerchief, that by that time you are in the family
mansion, repenting of your sins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be looked on like one in a dream, while the terms of
the wager were arranged with playful precision.&nbsp; She did not
know that dinner had been announced, till she found people
moving, and in spite of her antipathy to Mr. Calthorp, she
rejoiced to find him assigned to herself&mdash;dear, good Lucy
must have done it to keep Robin to herself, and dear, good Lucy
she shall be, in spite of the salmon, since in the progress
down-stairs she has cleared the cloud from his brow.</p>
<p>It was done by a confiding caressing clasp on his arm, and the
few words, &lsquo;Now for old friends!&nbsp; How charming little
Ph&oelig;be looks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>How different were his massive brow and deep-set eyes without
their usual load, and how sweet his gratified smile!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where have you been, you Robin?&nbsp; If I had not
passed you <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>in the Park, I should never have
guessed there was such a bird in London.&nbsp; I began to change
my mind, like Christiana&mdash;&ldquo;I thought Robins were
harmless and gentle birds, wont to hop about men&rsquo;s doors,
and feed on crumbs, and such-like harmless
food.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you seen me eating worms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen you at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not think you had leisure&mdash;I did not believe
I should be welcome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cruellest cut of all! positive
irony&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed! I am not so conceited as&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to suppose you could want me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there was I longing to hear about
Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; If you had only come, I could have contrived
her going to the <i>Zauberfl&ouml;te</i> with us last night, but
I didn&rsquo;t know the length of her tether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not know you were so kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be kinder yourself another time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I
know how I have been torn to pieces at Hiltonbury, without a
friend to say one word for the poor little morsel!&rsquo; she
said, piteously.</p>
<p>He was impelled to an eager &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; but
recalling facts, he modified his reply into, &lsquo;Friends
enough, but very anxious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I knew none of you trusted me,&rsquo; she said,
pretending to pout.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When play is so like earnest&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Slow people are taken in!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
fun!&nbsp; I like to show that I can walk alone sometimes, and
not be snatched up the moment I pop my head from under my
leading-strings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her pretty gay toss of the head prevented Robert from thinking
whether woman is meant to be without leading-strings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it was to avoid countenancing my vagaries that you
stayed away?&rsquo; she said, with a look of injured
innocence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was very much occupied,&rsquo; answered Robert,
feeling himself in the wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That horrid office!&nbsp; You aren&rsquo;t thinking of
becoming a Clarence, to drown yourself in brandy&mdash;that would
never do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I have given up all thoughts of that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You <i>thought</i>, you wretched Redbreast!&nbsp; I
<i>thought</i> you knew better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I ought,&rsquo; said Robert, gravely, &lsquo;but my
father wished me to make the experiment, and I must own, that
before I looked into the details, there were considerations
which&mdash;which&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such considerations as <i>&pound; s. d.</i>?&nbsp; For
shame!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, indeed,&rsquo; said the happy Robert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be judged you truly.&nbsp; I did not know what
might be the effect of habit&mdash;&rsquo; and he became
embarrassed, doubtful whether she would accept the assumption on
which he spoke; but she went beyond his hopes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only place I ever cared for is a very small old
parsonage,&rsquo; she said, with feeling in her tone.</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>&lsquo;Wrapworth? that is near Castle
Blanch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; I must show it you.&nbsp; You shall come
with Honor and Ph&oelig;be on Monday, and I will show you
everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be delighted&mdash;but is it not
arranged?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that.&nbsp; Mr. Prendergast
shall take you in, as he would a newly-arrived rhinoceros, if I
told him.&nbsp; He was our curate, and used to live in the house
even in our time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say a word, Robin; it is to
be.&nbsp; I must have you see my river, and the stile where my
father used to sit when he was tired.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never told
any one which that is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ordinarily Lucilla never seemed to think of her father, never
named him, and her outpouring was doubly prized by Robert, whose
listening face drew her on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was too much of a child to understand how fearfully
weak he must have been, for he could not come home from the
castle without a rest on that stile, and we used to play round
him, and bring him flowers.&nbsp; My best recollections are all
of that last summer&mdash;it seems like my whole life at home,
and much longer than it could really have been.&nbsp; We were all
in all to one another.&nbsp; How different it would have been if
he had lived!&nbsp; I think no one has believed in me
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something ineffably soft and sad in the last words,
as the beautiful, petted, but still lonely orphan cast down her
eyelids with a low long sigh, as though owning her errors, but
pleading this extenuation.&nbsp; Robert, much moved, was
murmuring something incoherent, but she went on.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Rashe does, perhaps.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see how it is a
part of the general disbelief in me to suppose that I come here
only for London seasons, and such like?&nbsp; I must live where I
have what the dear old soul there has not got to give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot doubt of her affection.&nbsp; I am sure
there is nothing she would not do for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; that is not what I want.&nbsp; It
can&rsquo;t be done, it must be <i>felt</i>, and that it never
will be.&nbsp; When there&rsquo;s a mutual antagonism, gratitude
becomes a fetter, intolerable when it is strained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot bear to hear you talk so; revering Miss
Charlecote as I do, and feeling that I owe everything to her
notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I find no fault, I reverence her too!&nbsp; It was
only the nature of things, not her intentions, nor her kindness,
that was to blame.&nbsp; She meant to be justice and mercy
combined towards us, but I had all the one, and Owen all the
other.&nbsp; Not that I am jealous!&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; Not that
she could help it; but no woman can help being hard on her
rival&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing but the sweet tone and sad arch smile could have made
this speech endurable to Robert, even though he remembered many
times when the trembling of the scale in Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
hands had filled him with indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You allow
that it was justice,&rsquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt of that,&rsquo; she laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor
Honor!&nbsp; I must <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>have been a grievous visitation, but
I am very good now; I shall come and spend Sunday as gravely as a
judge, and when you come to Wrapworth, you shall see how I can go
to the school when it is not forced down my throat&mdash;no merit
either, for our mistress is perfectly charming, with <i>such</i>
a voice!&nbsp; If I were Ph&oelig;be I would look out, for Owen
is desperately smitten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; repeated Robert, with a startled
look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen and Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; I considered it <i>une
affaire arrang&eacute;e</i> as much as&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She
had almost said you and me: Robert could supply the omission, but
he was only blind of <i>one</i> eye, and gravely said, &lsquo;It
is well there is plenty of time before Owen to tame him
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oney,&rsquo; laughed Lucilla; &lsquo;yes, he has a good
deal to do in that line, with his opinions in such a mess that I
really don&rsquo;t know what he does believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though the information was not new to Robert, her levity
dismayed him, and he gravely began, &lsquo;If you have such
fears&mdash;&rsquo; but she cut him off short.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever play at bagatelle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stared in displeased surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you never see the ball go joggling about before it
could settle into its hole, and yet abiding there very steadily
at last?&nbsp; Look on quietly, and you will see the poor fellow
as sober a parish priest as yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a very philosophical spectator of the
process,&rsquo; Robert said, still displeased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just consider what a capacious swallow the poor boy had
in his tender infancy, and how hard it was crammed with legends,
hymns, and allegories, with so many scruples bound down on his
poor little conscience, that no wonder, when the time of
expansion came, the whole concern should give way with a
jerk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s education had been
most anxiously admirable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Precisely so!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; Why, how
dull you are for a man who has been to Oxford!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should seriously be glad to hear your view, for
Owen&rsquo;s course has always been inexplicable to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To you, poor Robin, who lived gratefully on the crumbs
of our advantages!&nbsp; The point was that to you they were
crumbs, while we had a surfeit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen never seemed overdone.&nbsp; I used rather to hate
him for his faultlessness, and his familiarity with what awed my
ignorance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The worse for him!&nbsp; He was too apt a scholar, and
received all unresisting, unsifting&mdash;Anglo-Catholicism,
slightly touched with sentiment, enthusiasm for the Crusades,
passive obedience&mdash;acted faithfully up to it; imagined that
to be &ldquo;not a good Churchman,&rdquo; as he told Charles,
expressed the seven deadly sins, and that reasoning was the
deadliest of all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As far as I understand you, you mean that there was not
<!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>sufficient distinction between proven and
non-proven&mdash;important and unimportant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You begin to perceive.&nbsp; If Faith be overworked,
Reason kicks; and, of course, when Owen found the Holt was not
the world; that thinking was not the exclusive privilege of
demons; that habits he considered as imperative duties were
inconvenient, not to say impracticable; that his articles of
faith included much of the apocryphal,&mdash;why, there was a
general downfall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; sighed Robert, &lsquo;it
is a disheartening effect of so much care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She should have let him alone, then, for Uncle Kit to
make a sailor of.&nbsp; Then he would have had something better
to do than to <i>think</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are distressed about him?&rsquo; said Robert,
wistfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said she, laughing; &lsquo;but you
see I am too wise ever to think or distress myself.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll think himself straight in time, and begin a
reconstruction from his scattered materials, I suppose, and
meantime he is a very comfortable brother, as such things go; but
it is one of the grudges I can&rsquo;t help owing to Honora, that
such a fine fellow as that is not an independent sailor or
soldier, able to have some fun, and not looked on as a mere
dangler after the Holt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought the reverse was clearly
understood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She ought to have &ldquo;acted as sich.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How my relatives, and yours too, would laugh if you told them
so!&nbsp; Not that I think, like them, that it is Elizabethan
dislike to naming a successor, nor to keep him on his good
behaviour; she is far above that, but it is plain how it will
he.&nbsp; The only other relation she knows in the world is
farther off than we are&mdash;not a bit more of a Charlecote, and
twice her age; and when she has waited twenty or thirty years
longer for the auburn-haired lady my father saw in a chapel at
Toronto, she will bethink herself that Owen, or Owen&rsquo;s
eldest son, had better have it than the Queen.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the sense of it; but I hate the hanger-on position it keeps him
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a misfortune,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;People treat him as a man of expectations, and at his age
it would not be easy to disown them, even to himself.&nbsp; He
has an eldest son air about him, which makes people impose on him
the belief that he is one; and yet, who could have guarded
against the notion more carefully than Miss
Charlecote?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m of Uncle Kit&rsquo;s mind,&rsquo; said
Lucilla, &lsquo;that children should be left to their natural
guardians.&nbsp; What! is Lolly really moving before I have
softened down the edge of my ingratitude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So!&rsquo; said Miss Charteris, as she brought up the
rear of the procession of ladies on the stairs.</p>
<p>Lucilla faced about on the step above, with a face where
interrogation was mingled with merry defiance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that is why the Calthorp could not get a word all
the livelong dinner-time!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I used you ill; I promised you an
opportunity of studying &ldquo;Cock Robin,&rdquo; but you see I
could not help keeping him myself&mdash;I had not seen him for so
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were very welcome!&nbsp; It is the very creature
that baffles me.&nbsp; I can talk to any animal in the world
except an incipient parson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, for instance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! if people choose to put a force on nature, there
can be no general rules.&nbsp; But, Cilly, you know I&rsquo;ve
always said you should marry whoever you liked; but I require
another assurance&mdash;on your word and honour&mdash;that you
are not irrevocably Jenny Wren as yet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you not see the currant wine?&rsquo; said Cilly,
pulling leaves off a myrtle in a tub on the stairs, and
scattering them over her cousin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seriously, Cilly!&nbsp; Ah, I see now&mdash;your
exclusive attention to him entirely reassures me.&nbsp; You would
never have served him so, if you had meant it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was commonplace in me,&rsquo; said Lucilla, gravely,
&lsquo;but I could not help it; he made me feel so good&mdash;or
so bad&mdash;that I believe I shall&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not give up the salmon,&rsquo; cried Horatia.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Cilly, you will drive me to commit matrimony on the
spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do,&rsquo; said Lucilla, running lightly up, and
dancing into the drawing-room, where the ladies were so much at
their ease, on low couches and ottomans, that Ph&oelig;be stood
transfixed by the novelty of a drawing-room treated with such
freedom as was seldom permitted in even the schoolroom at
Beauchamp, when Miss Fennimore was in presence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, bright Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; cried Lucilla,
pouncing on both her hands, and drawing her towards the other
room, &lsquo;it is ten ages since I saw you, and you must bring
your taste to aid my choice of the fly costume.&nbsp; Did you
hear, Rashe?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a bet with Lord William that I
appear at the ball all in flies.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it
fun?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, jolly!&rsquo; cried Horatia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Make
yourself a pike-fly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; not a guy for any one.&nbsp; Only wear a
trimming of salmon-flies, which will be lovely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not really mean it?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mean it?&nbsp; With all my heart, in spite of the
tremendous sacrifice of good flies.&nbsp; Where honour is
concerned&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I knew you would not shirk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I ever say so?&rsquo;&mdash;in a whisper, not
unheard by Ph&oelig;be, and affording her so much satisfaction
that she only said, in a grave, puzzled voice, &lsquo;The
hooks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hooks and all,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do
nothing by halves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a state of mind the fishermen will be in!
proceeded Horatia.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have every one of
them at your feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall tell them that two of a trade never
agree.&nbsp; Come, and let us choose.&rsquo;&nbsp; And opening a
drawer, Lucilla took out her <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>long
parchment book, and was soon eloquent on the merits of the
doctor, the butcher, the duchess, and all her other radiant
fabrications of gold pheasants&rsquo; feathers, parrot plumes,
jays&rsquo; wings, and the like.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be could not help
admiring their beauty, though she was perplexed all the while,
uncomfortable on Robert&rsquo;s account, and yet not enough
assured of the usages of the London world to be certain whether
this were unsuitable.&nbsp; The Charteris family, though not of
the most <i>&eacute;lite</i> circles of all, were in one to which
the Fulmorts had barely the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, and the ease
and dash of the young ladies, Lucilla&rsquo;s superior age, and
caressing patronage, all made Ph&oelig;be in her own eyes too
young and ignorant to pass an opinion.&nbsp; She would have known
more about the properties of a rectangle or the dangers of a
paper currency.</p>
<p>Longing to know what Miss Charlecote thought, she stood,
answering as little as possible, until Rashe had been summoned to
the party in the outer room, and Cilly said, laughing,
&lsquo;Well, does she astonish your infant mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not quite enter into her,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The best-natured and most unappreciated girl in the
world.&nbsp; Up to anything, and only a victim to
prejudice.&nbsp; You, who have a strong-minded governess, ought
to be superior to the delusion that it is interesting to be
stupid and helpless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never thought so,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, feeling
for a moment in the wrong, as Lucilla always managed to make her
antagonists do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you do, or why look at me in that pleading,
perplexed fashion, save that you have become possessed with the
general prejudice.&nbsp; Weigh it, by the light of
Whately&rsquo;s logic, and own candidly wherefore Rashe and I
should be more liable to come to grief, travelling alone, than
two men of the same ages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not grounds enough to judge,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, beginning as though Miss Fennimore were giving an
exercise to her reasoning powers; then, continuing with her
girlish eagerness of entreaty, &lsquo;I only know that it cannot
be right, since it grieves Robin and Miss Charlecote so
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And all that grieves Robin and Miss Charlecote must be
shocking, eh?&nbsp; Oh, Ph&oelig;be, what very women all the Miss
Fennimores in the world leave us, and how lucky it is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t think you are going to grieve
them,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, earnestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate the word!&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Plaguing is only fun, but grieving, that is
serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do believe this is only plaguing!&rsquo; cried
Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;and that this is your way of disposing of all
the flies.&nbsp; I shall tell Robin so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To spoil all my fun,&rsquo; exclaimed Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be only gave a nod and smile of supreme
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but, Ph&oelig;be, if I&rsquo;m to grieve nobody,
what&rsquo;s to become of poor Rashe, you little selfish
woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Selfish, no!&rsquo; sturdily said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If it be wrong for you, it must be equally wrong for her;
and perhaps&rsquo; she added, <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>slowly,
&lsquo;you would both be glad of some good reason for giving it
up.&nbsp; Lucy, dear, do tell me whether you really like it, for
I cannot fancy you so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like it?&nbsp; Well, yes!&nbsp; I like the salmons, and
I dote on the fun and the fuss.&nbsp; I say, Ph&oelig;be, can you
bear the burden of a secret?&nbsp; Well&mdash;only mind, if you
tell Robin or Honor, I shall certainly go; we never would have
taken it up in earnest if such a rout had not been made about it,
that we were driven to show we did not care, and could be trusted
with ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t mean it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s as people behave themselves.&nbsp;
Hush!&nbsp; Here comes Honor.&nbsp; Look here, Sweet Honey, I am
in a process of selection.&nbsp; I am pledged to come out at the
ball in a unique trimming of salmon-flies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear!&rsquo; cried poor Honor, in consternation,
&lsquo;you can&rsquo;t be so absurd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so slow not to be absurd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At fit times, yes; but to make yourself so
conspicuous!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They say I can&rsquo;t help that,&rsquo; returned Lucy,
in a tone of comical melancholy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, we will talk it over on Sunday, when I
hope you may be in a rational mood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say so,&rsquo; implored Lucilla, &lsquo;or
I shan&rsquo;t have the courage to come.&nbsp; A rational
mood!&nbsp; It is enough to frighten one away; and really I do
want very much to come.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not heard a word yet
about the Holt.&nbsp; How is the old dame, this
summer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Lucy went on with unceasing interest about all Hiltonbury
matters, great and small, bewitching Honora more than would have
seemed possible under the circumstances.&nbsp; She was such a
winning fairy that it was hardly possible to treat her seriously,
or to recollect causes of displeasure, when under the spell of
her caressing vivacity, and unruffled, audacious fun.</p>
<p>So impregnable was her gracious good-humour, so untameable her
high spirits, that it was only by remembering the little spitfire
of twelve or fourteen years ago that it was credible that she had
a temper at all; the temper erst wont to exhale in chamois bounds
and dervish pirouettes, had apparently left not a trace behind,
and the sullen ungraciousness to those who offended her had
become the sunniest sweetness, impossible to disturb.&nbsp; Was
it real improvement?&nbsp; Concealment it was not, for Lucilla
had always been transparently true.&nbsp; Was it not more
probably connected with that strange levity, almost
insensibility, that had apparently indurated feelings which in
early childhood had seemed sensitive even to the extent of
violence?&nbsp; Was she only good-humoured because nothing
touched her?&nbsp; Had that agony of parting with her gentle
father seared her affections, till she had become like a polished
gem, all bright glancing beauty, but utterly unfeeling?</p>
<h3><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>CHAPTER V</h3>
<blockquote><p>Reproof falleth on the saucy as water.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Feejee Proverb</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considerate of the slender purses of her children, Honora had
devoted her carriage to fetch them to St. Wulstan&rsquo;s on the
Sunday morning, but her offer had been declined, on the ground
that the Charteris conveyances were free to them, and that it was
better to make use of an establishment to which Sunday was no
object, than to cloud the honest face of the Hiltonbury coachman
by depriving his horses of their day of rest.&nbsp; Owen would
far rather take a cab than so affront Grey!&nbsp; Pleased with
his bright manner, Honora had yet reason to fear that expense was
too indifferent to both brother and sister, and that the
Charteris household only encouraged recklessness.&nbsp; Wherever
she went she heard of the extravagance of the family, and in the
shops the most costly wares were recommended as the choice of
Mrs. Charteris.&nbsp; Formerly, though Honor had equipped Lucilla
handsomely for visits to Castle Blanch, she had always found her
wardrobe increased by the gifts of her uncle and aunt.&nbsp; The
girl had been of age more than a year, and in the present state
of the family, it was impossible that her dress could be still
provided at their expense, yet it was manifestly far beyond her
means; and what could be the result?&nbsp; She would certainly
brook no interference, and would cast advice to the winds.&nbsp;
Poor Honor could only hope for a crash that would bring her to
reason, and devise schemes for forcing her from the effects of
her own imprudence without breaking into her small portion.&nbsp;
The great fear was lost false pride, and Charteris influence,
should lead her to pay her debts at the cost of a marriage with
the millionaire; and Honor could take little comfort in
Owen&rsquo;s assurance that the Calthorp had too much sense to
think of Cilly Sandbrook, and only promoted and watched her
vagaries for the sake of amusement and curiosity.&nbsp; There was
small satisfaction to her well-wishers in hearing that no
sensible man could think seriously of her.</p>
<p>Anxiously was that Sunday awaited in Woolstone-lane, the whole
party feeling that this was the best chance of seeing Lucilla in
a reasonable light, and coming to an understanding with
her.&nbsp; Owen was often enough visible in the interim, and
always extremely agreeable; but Lucilla never, and he only
brought an account of her gaieties, shrugging his shoulders over
them.</p>
<p>The day came; the bells began, they chimed, they changed, but
still no Sandbrooks appeared.&nbsp; Mr. Parsons set off, and
Robert made an excursion to the corner of the street.&nbsp; In
vain Miss Charlecote still lingered; Mrs. Parsons, in despair,
called Ph&oelig;be on with her as the single bell rang, and Honor
and <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Robert presently started with heads
turned over their shoulders, and lips laying all blame on
Charteris&rsquo; delays of breakfast.&nbsp; A last wistful look,
and the church porch engulfed them; but even when enclosed in the
polished square pew, they could not resign hope at every tread on
the matted floor, and finally subsided into a trust that the
truants might after service emerge from a seat near the
door.&nbsp; There were only too many to choose from.</p>
<p>That hope baffled, Honora still manufactured excuses which
Ph&oelig;be greedily seized and offered to her brother, but she
read his rejection of them in his face, and to her conviction
that it was all accident, he answered, as she took his arm,
&lsquo;A small accident would suffice for Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think he is hindering his
sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; I only know that he is one of
the many stumbling-blocks in her way.&nbsp; He can do no good to
any one with whom he associates intimately.&nbsp; I hate to see
him reading poetry with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you never tell me so?&rsquo; asked the startled
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are so much taken up with him that I can never get
at you, when I am not devoured by that office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I did not know it,&rsquo; humbly answered
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is very kind and amusing, and Miss
Charlecote is so fond of him that, of course, we must be
together; but I never meant to neglect you, Robin,
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, nonsense, it is no paltry jealousy; only now I
can speak to you, I must,&rsquo; said Robert, who had been in
vain craving for this opportunity of getting his sister alone,
ever since the alarm excited by Lucilla&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this harm, Robin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say not a word of it.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
heart must not be broken before its time, and at any rate it
shall not come through me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, Robert?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The knowledge of what he is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say it
is prejudice.&nbsp; I know I never liked him, but you shall hear
why.&nbsp; You ought now&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s mind had often of late glanced back to the
childish days when, with their present opinions reversed, he
thought Owen a muff, and Owen thought him a reprobate.&nbsp; To
his own blunt and reserved nature, the expressions, so charming
to poor Miss Charlecote, had been painfully distasteful.&nbsp;
Sentiment, profession, obtrusive reverence, and fault-finding
scruples had revolted him, even when he thought it a proof of his
own irreligion to be provoked.&nbsp; Afterwards, when both were
schoolboys, Robert had yearly increased in conscientiousness
under good discipline and training, but, in their holiday
meetings, had found Owen&rsquo;s standard receding as his own
advanced, and heard the once-deficient manly spirit asserted by
boasts of exploits and deceptions repugnant to a well-conditioned
lad.&nbsp; He saw Miss <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>Charlecote&rsquo;s perfect confidence abused and
trifled with, and the more he grew in a sense of honour, the more
he disliked Owen Sandbrook.</p>
<p>At the University, where Robert&rsquo;s career had been
respectable and commonplace, Owen was at once a man of
mark.&nbsp; Mental and physical powers alike rendered him
foremost among his compeers; he could compete with the fast, and
surpass the slow on their own ground; and his talents, ready
celerity, good-humoured audacity, and quick resource, had always
borne him through with the authorities, though there was scarcely
an excess or irregularity in which he was not a partaker; and
stories of Sandbrook&rsquo;s daring were always circulating among
the undergraduates.&nbsp; But though Robert could have scared
Ph&oelig;be with many a history of lawless pranks, yet these were
not his chief cause for dreading Owen&rsquo;s intimacy with
her.&nbsp; It was that he was one of the youths on whom the
spirit of the day had most influence, one of the most adventurous
thinkers and boldest talkers: wild in habits, not merely from
ebullition of spirits, but from want of faith in the restraining
power.</p>
<p>All this Robert briefly expressed in the words,
&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, it is not that his habits are irregular and
unsteady; many are so whose hearts are sound.&nbsp; But he is not
sound&mdash;his opinions are loose, and he only respects and
patronizes Divine Truth as what has approved itself to so many
good, great, and beloved human creatures.&nbsp; It is not
denial&mdash;it is patronage.&nbsp; It is the commonsense
heresy&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought we all ought to learn common
sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, in things human, but in things Divine it is the
subtle English form of rationalism.&nbsp; This is no time to
explain, Ph&oelig;be; but human sense and intellect are made the
test, and what surpasses them is only admired as long as its
stringent rules do not fetter the practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry you told me,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
thoughtfully, &lsquo;for I always liked him; he is so kind to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Had not Robert been full of his own troubles he would have
been reassured, but he only gave a contemptuous groan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Lucy know this?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She told me herself what I well knew before.&nbsp; She
does not reflect enough to take it seriously, and contrives to
lay the blame upon the narrowness of Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
training.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Robin!&nbsp; When all our best knowledge came from
the Holt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She says, perhaps not unjustly, that Miss Charlecote
overdid things with him, and that this is reaction.&nbsp; She
observes keenly.&nbsp; If she would only <i>think</i>!&nbsp; She
would have been perfect had her father lived, to work on her by
affection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The time for that is coming&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert checked her, saying, &lsquo;Stay, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
The other night I was fooled by her engaging ways, but each day
since I have become more convinced that I must learn whether she
be only <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>using me like the rest.&nbsp; I want
you to be a witness of my resolution, lest I should be tempted to
fail.&nbsp; I came to town, hesitating whether to enter the
business for her sake.&nbsp; I found that this could not be done
without a great sin.&nbsp; I look on myself as dedicated to the
ministry, and thus bound to have a household suited to my
vocation.&nbsp; All must turn on her willingness to conform to
this standard.&nbsp; I shall lay it before her.&nbsp; I can bear
the suspense no longer.&nbsp; My temper and resolution are going,
and I am good for nothing.&nbsp; Let the touchstone be, whether
she will resign her expedition to Ireland, and go quietly home
with Miss Charlecote.&nbsp; If she will so do, there is surely
that within her that will shine out brighter when removed from
irritation on the one side, or folly on the other.&nbsp; If she
will not, I have no weight with her; and it is due to the service
I am to undertake, to force myself away from a pursuit that could
only distract me.&nbsp; I have no right to be a clergyman and
choose a hindrance not a help&mdash;one whose tastes would lead
back to the world, instead of to my work!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, in stern, rigid resolution&mdash;only allowing
himself one long, deep, heavy sigh at the end&mdash;he stood
still at the gates of the court, which were opened as the rest of
the party came up; and, as they crossed and entered the hall,
they beheld, through the open door of the drawing-room, two
figures in the window&mdash;one, a dark torso, perched outside on
the sill; the other, in blue skirt and boy-like bodice,
negligently reposing on one side of the window-seat, her dainty
little boots on the other; her coarse straw bonnet, crossed with
white, upon the floor; the wind playing tricks with the silky
glory of her flaxen ringlets; her cheek flushed with lovely
carnation, declining on her shoulder; her eyes veiled by their
fair fringes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; she cried, springing up, &lsquo;almost
caught asleep!&rsquo;&nbsp; And Owen, pocketing his pipe, spun
his legs over the windowsill, while both began, in rattling,
playful vindication and recrimination&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(he
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault (</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(she
wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t a wilful heathen; Mr. Parsons,
it was he&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was she who chose to take the by-ways, and make us
late.&nbsp; Rush into church before a whole congregation, reeking
from a six-miles walk!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve more respect for the
Establishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You walked!&rsquo; cried five voices.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See her Sabbatarianism!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; I should have driven Charlie&rsquo;s
cab.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlie has some common sense where his horse is
concerned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wanted it himself, you <i>know</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She grew sulky, and victimized me to a walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it was excellent fun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and because poor Calthorp had proffered his cab for
her <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>to drive to Jericho, and welcome,
she drags me into all sorts of streets of villainous savours,
that he might not catch us up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Horrid hard mouth that horse of his,&rsquo; said
Lucilla, by way of dashing the satisfaction on Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wonder you were late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that was all Owen&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp; He vowed
that he had not nerve to face the pew-opener!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The grim female in weeds&mdash;no, indeed!&rsquo; said
Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed, I objected to entering in the guise of
flaming meteors both on reverential and sanatory
grounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Insanatory, methinks,&rsquo; said Miss Charlecote;
&lsquo;how could you let her sleep, so much heated, in this
thorough draught!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself,&rsquo; said Cilly,
quaintly shaking her head; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not such a goose as
to go and catch cold!&nbsp; Oh! Ph&oelig;be, my salmon-flies are
loveliness itself; and I hereby give notice, that a fine of three
pairs of thick boots has been proclaimed for every pun upon
sisters of the angle and sisters of the angels!&nbsp; So beware,
Robin!&rsquo;&mdash;and the comical audacity with which she
turned on him, won a smile from the grave lips that had lately
seemed so remote from all peril of complimenting her
whimsies.&nbsp; Even Mr. Parsons said &lsquo;the fun was
tempting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and get ready for luncheon,&rsquo; said the less
fascinated Honora, moving away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and catch it!&rsquo; cried the elf, skipping
up-stairs before her and facing round her &lsquo;Dear old
Honeyseed.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I honour your motives; but
wouldn&rsquo;t it be for the convenience of all parties, if you
took <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> celebrated
advice&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How am I to speak, Lucy,&rsquo; said Honora, &lsquo;if
you come with the avowed intention of disregarding what I
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then hadn&rsquo;t you better not?&rsquo; murmured the
girl, in the lowest tone, drooping her head, and peeping under
her eyelashes, as she sat with a hand on each elbow of her
arm-chair, as though in the stocks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not, my child,&rsquo; was the mournful answer,
&lsquo;if I could help caring for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla sprang up and kissed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,
then; I don&rsquo;t like anybody to be sorry,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not worth
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I help it, when I see you throwing away
happiness&mdash;welfare&mdash;the good opinion of all your
friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Honora, you taught me yourself not to mind Mrs.
Grundy!&nbsp; Come, never mind, the reasonable world has found
out that women are less dependent than they used to
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not what the world thinks, but what is really
decorous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla laughed&mdash;though with some temper&mdash;&lsquo;I
wonder what we are going to do otherwise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going beyond the ordinary restraints of women
in your station; and a person who does so, can never tell to what
she may expose herself.&nbsp; Liberties are taken when people
come out to meet them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s as they choose!&rsquo; cried Lucilla, with
such a gesture of <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>her hand, such a flash of her blue
eyes, that she seemed trebly the woman, and it would have been
boldness indeed to presume with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but a person who has even had to protect herself
from incivility, to which she has wilfully exposed herself, does
not remain what she might be behind her screen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Omne ignotum pro terribili</i>,&rsquo; laughed
Lucilla, still not to be made serious.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, I
don&rsquo;t believe that the world is so flagrantly bent on
annoying every pretty girl.&nbsp; People call me vain, but I
never was so vain as that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always found them
very civil; and Ireland is the land of civility.&nbsp; Now,
seriously, my good cousin Honor, do you candidly expect any harm
to befall us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think you likely to meet with absolute
injury.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lucilla clapped her hands, and cried,
&lsquo;An admission, an admission!&nbsp; I told Rashe you were a
sincere woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Miss Charlecote went on,
&lsquo;But there is harm to yourself in the affectation of
masculine habits; it is a blunting of the delicacy suited to a
Christian maiden, and not like the women whom St. Paul and St.
Peter describe.&nbsp; You would find that you had forfeited the
esteem, not only of ordinary society, but of persons whose
opinions you do value; and in both these respects you would
suffer harm.&nbsp; You, my poor child, who have no one to control
you, or claim your obedience as a right, are doubly bound to be
circumspect.&nbsp; I have no power over you; but if you have any
regard for her to whom your father confided you&mdash;nay, if you
consult what you know would have been his wishes&mdash;you will
give up this project.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The luncheon-bell had already rung, and consideration for the
busy clergyman compelled her to go down with these last words,
feeling as if there were a leaden weight at her heart.</p>
<p>Lucilla remained standing before the glass, arranging her
wind-tossed hair; and, in her vehemence, tearing out combfuls, as
she pulled petulantly against the tangled curls.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her
old way&mdash;to come over me with my father!&nbsp; Ha!&mdash;I
love him too well to let him be Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s engine
for managing me!&mdash;her <i>dernier ressort</i> to play on my
feelings.&nbsp; Nor will I have Robin set at me!&nbsp; Whether I
go or not, shall be as I please, not as any one else does; and if
I stay at home, Rashe shall own it is not for the sake of the
conclave here.&nbsp; I told her she might trust me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Down she went, and at luncheon devoted herself to the
captivation of Mr. Parsons; afterwards insisting on going to the
schools&mdash;she, whose aversion to them was Honora&rsquo;s
vexation at home.&nbsp; Strangers to make a sensation were
contrary to the views of the Parsonses; but the wife found her
husband inconsistent&mdash;&lsquo;one lady, more or less, could
make no difference on this first Sunday;&rsquo; and, by and by,
Mrs. Parsons found a set of little formal white-capped faces, so
beaming with entertainment, at the young lady&rsquo;s stories,
and the young lady herself looking so charming, that she, too,
fell under the enchantment.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>After church, Miss Charlecote proposed a few turns in
the garden; dingy enough, but a marvel for the situation: and
here the tacit object of herself and Ph&oelig;be was to afford
Robert an opportunity for the interview on which so much
depended.&nbsp; But it was like trying to catch a butterfly;
Lucilla was here, there, everywhere; and an excuse was hardly
made for leaving her beside the grave, silent young man, ere her
merry tones were heard chattering to some one else.&nbsp; Perhaps
Robert, heart-sick and oppressed with the importance of what
trembled on his tongue, was not ready in seizing the moment;
perhaps she would not let him speak; at any rate, she was aware
of some design; since, baffling Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s last attempt,
she danced up to her bedroom after her, and throwing herself into
a chair, in a paroxysm of laughter, cried, &lsquo;You abominable
little pussycat of a man&oelig;uvrer; I thought you were in a
better school for the proprieties!&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t make
your round eyes, and look so dismayed, or you&rsquo;ll kill me
with laughing!&nbsp; Cooking
<i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;tes</i>, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;I
thought better of you.&nbsp; Oh, fie!&rsquo; and holding up her
finger, as if in displeasure, she hid her face in ecstasies of
mirth at Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s bewildered simplicity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert wanted to speak to you,&rsquo; she said, with
puzzled gravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you would have set us together by the ears!&nbsp;
No, no, thank you, I&rsquo;ve had enough of that sort of thing
for one day.&nbsp; And what shallow excuses.&nbsp; Oh! what fun
to hear your pretexts.&nbsp; Wanting to see what Mrs. Parsons was
doing, when you knew perfectly well she was deep in a sermon, and
wished you at the antipodes.&nbsp; And blushing all the time,
like a full-blown poppy,&rsquo; and off she went on a fresh
score&mdash;but Ph&oelig;be, though disconcerted for a moment,
was not to be put out of countenance when she understood her
ground, and she continued with earnestness, undesired by her
companion&mdash;&lsquo;Very likely I managed badly, but I know
you do not really think it improper to see Robert alone, and it
is very important that you should do so.&nbsp; Indeed it is,
Lucy,&rsquo; she added&mdash;the youthful candour and seriousness
of her pleading, in strong contrast to the flighty, mocking
carelessness of Lucilla&rsquo;s manners; &lsquo;do pray see him;
I know he would make you listen.&nbsp; Will you be so very
kind?&nbsp; If you would go into the little cedar room, I could
call him at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Point blank!&nbsp; Sitting in my cedar parlour!&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, you&rsquo;ll be the death of me,&rsquo; cried Cilly,
between peals of merriment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think I have
nerves of brass?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would not laugh, if you knew how much he
feels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very good thing for people to feel!&nbsp; It saves
them from torpor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, it is not kind to laugh when I tell you he is
miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s only proper, my dear,&rsquo; said Lucilla,
entertained by teasing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not miserable from doubt,&rsquo; answered Ph&oelig;be,
disconcerting in her turn.&nbsp; &lsquo;We know you too well for
that;&rsquo; and as an expression, amused, indignant, but far
from favourable, came over <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the fair
face she was watching, she added in haste, &lsquo;It is this
project, he thought you had said it was given up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am much indebted,&rsquo; said Lucilla, haughtily, but
again relapsing into laughter; &lsquo;but to find myself so
easily disposed of . . .&nbsp; Oh! Ph&oelig;be, there&rsquo;s no
scolding such a baby as you; but if it were not so
absurd&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, Lucy, I beg your pardon; is it all a mistake, or
have I said what was wrong?&nbsp; Poor Robin will be so
unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s distress touched Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, you little goose; aren&rsquo;t you woman
enough yet to know that one flashes out at finding oneself
labelled, and made over before one&rsquo;s time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad if it was all my blundering,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Lucy, I was very wrong, but you
see I always was so happy in believing it was
understood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How stupid,&rsquo; cried Lucilla; &lsquo;one would
never have any fun; no, you haven&rsquo;t tasted the sweets yet,
or you would know one has no notion of being made sure of till
one chooses!&nbsp; Yes, yes, I saw he was primed and cocked, but
I&rsquo;m not going to let him go off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, have you no pity?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk commonplaces, my
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you knew how much depends upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, I know that,&rsquo; with an arch smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you do not,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, so stoutly
that Lucilla looked at her in some suspense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think,&rsquo; said honest Ph&oelig;be, in her
extremity, &lsquo;that he only wants to make&mdash;to propose to
you!&nbsp; Now, it is not only that, Lucilla,&rsquo; and her
voice sank, as she could hardly keep from crying; &lsquo;he will
never do that if you go on as you are doing now; he does not
think it would be right for a clergyman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I dare say!&rsquo; quoth Lucilla, and then a
silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did Honor tell him so,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, never!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;no one
has said a word against you! only don&rsquo;t you know how quiet
and good any one belonging to a clergyman should be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal of news to-day, and
it is all my own fault, for indulging in sentiment on
Wednesday.&nbsp; I shall know better another time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t care!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be,
turning round, with eyes flashing as Lucilla did not know they
could lighten.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well!&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
think Robert worth it, I suppose I ought not to grieve, for you
can&rsquo;t be what I used to think you and it will be better for
him when he once has settled his mind&mdash;than if&mdash;if
afterwards you disappointed him and were a fine lady&mdash;but
oh! he will be so unhappy,&rsquo; her tears were coming fast;
&lsquo;and, Lucy, I did like you so much!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this is the funniest thing of all,&rsquo; cried
Lucilla, by way of braving her own emotion; &lsquo;little Miss
Ph&oelig;be gone into the heroics!&rsquo; and she caught her two
hands, and holding her fast, <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>kissed her
on both cheeks; &lsquo;a gone coon, am I, Ph&oelig;be, no better
than one of the wicked; and Robin, he grew angry, hopped upon a
twig, did he!&nbsp; I beg your pardon, my dear, but it makes me
laugh to think of his dignified settling of his mind.&nbsp; Oh!
how soon it could be unsettled again!&nbsp; Come, I won&rsquo;t
have any more of this; let it alone, Ph&oelig;be, and trust me
that things will adjust themselves all the better for letting
them have their swing.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you look prematurely
uneasy, and don&rsquo;t go and make Robin think that I have
immolated him at the altar of the salmon.&nbsp; Say nothing of
all this; you will only make a mess in narrating it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely I may,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but
if you will not speak to him yourself, I shall tell him how you
feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you can,&rsquo; laughed Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean, how you receive what I have told you of his
views; I do not think it would be fair or kind to keep him in
ignorance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much good may it do him,&rsquo; said Lucy; &lsquo;but I
fancy you will tell him, whether I give you leave or not, and it
can&rsquo;t make much difference.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tackle him, as
the old women say, when I please, and the madder he may choose to
go, the better fun it will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you are saying so to tease me&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but as I know you don&rsquo;t mean it, I
shall wait till after the party; and then, unless you have had it
out with him, I shall tell him what you have said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Lucilla, ironically conveying to
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s mind the conviction that she did not believe
that Robert&rsquo;s attachment could suffer from what had here
passed.&nbsp; Either she meant to grant the decisive interview,
or else she was too confident in her own power to believe that he
could relinquish her; at all events, Ph&oelig;be had sagacity
enough to infer that she was not indifferent to him, though as
the provoking damsel ran down-stairs, Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s loyal
spirit first admitted a doubt whether the tricksy sprite might
not prove as great a torment as a delight to Robin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However,&rsquo; reflected she, &lsquo;I shall make the
less mischief if I set it down while I remember it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not much like romance, but practical sense was both native and
cultivated in Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s pupil.&nbsp; Yet as she
recorded the sentences, and read them over bereft of the
speaker&rsquo;s caressing grace, she blamed herself as unkind,
and making the worst of gay retorts which had been provoked by
her own home thrusts.&nbsp; &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; she thought,
&lsquo;he will be glad to see that it was partly my fault, and he
need never see it at all if Lucy will let him speak to her
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, Honora had found from Owen that the young ladies had
accepted an invitation to a very gay house in Cheshire, so that
their movements would for a fortnight remain doubtful.&nbsp; She
recurred to her view that the only measure to be taken was for
him to follow them, so as to be able to interpose in any
emergency, and she anxiously pressed on him the funds
required.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I catch it if they found me
out!&rsquo; said Owen, shrugging his shoulders.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
but indeed, Sweet Honey, I meant to have made up for this naughty
girl&rsquo;s desertion.&nbsp; You and I would have had such rides
and readings together: I want you to put me on good terms with
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear boy!&nbsp; But won&rsquo;t that best be done by
minding your sister?&nbsp; She does want it, Owen; the less she
will be prudent for herself, the more we must think for
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She can do better for herself than you imagine,&rsquo;
said Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Men say, with all her free ways, they
could not go the least bit farther with her than she
pleases.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t suppose it, but she can keep
out of scrapes better than Rashe can&mdash;never has been in one
yet, and Rashe in twenty.&nbsp; Never mind, your Honor,
there&rsquo;s sound stuff in the bonny scapegrace; all the better
for being free and unconventional.&nbsp; The world owes a great
deal to those who dare to act for themselves; though, I own, it
is a trial when one&rsquo;s own domestic womankind take
thereto.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or one&rsquo;s mankind to encouraging it,&rsquo; said
Honor, smiling, but showing that she was hurt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t encourage it; I am only too wise to give
it the zest of opposition.&nbsp; Was Lucy ever bent upon a
naughty trick without being doubly incited by the pleasure of
showing that she cared not for her younger brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you are only too lazy!&nbsp; But, will you
go?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it can be a penance.&nbsp; You
would see new country, and get plenty of sport.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come with me, Honey,&rsquo; said he with the most
insinuating manner, which almost moved her.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
jolly it would be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense! an elderly spinster,&rsquo; she said, really
pleased, though knowing it impossible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff!&rsquo; he returned in the same tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Make it as good as a honeymoon.&nbsp; Think of Killarney,
Honor!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You silly boy, I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
harvest at home; besides, it would only aggravate that mad girl
doubly to have me coming after her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you will not take care of me on a literal
wild-goose chase,&rsquo; said Owen, with playful
disconsolateness, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not answer for the
consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, you go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vacation rambles are too tempting to be resisted; but,
mind, I don&rsquo;t promise to act good genius save at the last
extremity, or else shall never get forgiven, and I shall keep
some way in the rear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So closed the consultation; and after an evening which Lucilla
perforce rendered lively, she and her brother took their
leave.&nbsp; The next day they were to accompany the Charterises
to Castle Blanch to prepare for the festivities; Honor and her
two young friends following on the Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<blockquote><p>He who sits by haunted well<br />
Is subject to the Nixie&rsquo;s spell;<br />
He who walks on lonely beach<br />
To the mermaid&rsquo;s charmed speech;<br />
He who walks round ring of green<br />

class="smcap">Scott</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the station nearest to Castle Blanch stood the tall form of
Owen Sandbrook, telling Honor that he and his sister had brought
the boat; the river was the longer way, but they would prefer it
to the road; and so indeed they did, for Ph&oelig;be herself had
had enough of the City to appreciate the cool verdure and calm
stillness of the meadow pathway, by which they descended to the
majestic river, smoothly sleeping in glassy quiet, or stealing
along in complacently dimpling ripples.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank, shading off the sun, an oak copse sloped
steeply towards the river, painting upon the surface a still
shimmering likeness of the summit of the wood, every mass of
foliage, every blushing spray receiving a perfect counterpart,
and full in the midst of the magic mirror floated what might have
been compared to the roseate queen lily of the waters on her
leaf.</p>
<p>There, in the flat, shallow boat reclined the maiden, leaning
over the gunwale, gazing into the summer wavelets with which one
bare pinkly-tinted hand was toying, and her silken ringlets all
but dipping in, from beneath the round black hat, archly looped
up on one side by a carnation bow, and encircled by a series of
the twin jetty curls of the mallard; while the fresh rose colour
of the spreading muslin dress was enhanced by the black scarf
that hung carelessly over it.&nbsp; There was a moment&rsquo;s
pause, as if no one could break the spell; but Owen, striding on
from behind, quickly dissolved the enchantment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You monkey, you&rsquo;ve cast off.&nbsp; You may float
on to Greenwich next!&rsquo; he indignantly shouted.</p>
<p>She started, shaking her head saucily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas so slow there, and so broiling,&rsquo; she
called back, &lsquo;and I knew I should only drift down to meet
you, and could put in when I pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therewith she took the sculls and began rowing towards the
bank, but without force sufficient to prevent herself from being
borne farther down than she intended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; she exclaimed, fearlessly
laughing as she passed them.</p>
<p>Robert was ready to plunge in to stem her progress, lest she
should meet with some perilous eddy, but Owen laid hold on him,
saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be nervous, she&rsquo;s all right;
only giving trouble, after the nature of women.&nbsp; There; are
you satisfied?&rsquo; he called to her, as she came to a stop
against a reed bed, with <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>a tall
fence interposed between boat and passengers.&nbsp; &lsquo;A nice
ferry-woman you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and get me up again,&rsquo; was all her
answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serve you right if I never picked you up till
London-bridge,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stand clear,
Fulmort,&rsquo; and with a run and a bound, he vaulted over the
high hedge, and went crackling through the nodding bulrushes and
reed-maces; while Lucy, having accomplished pulling up one of the
latter, was pointing it lancewise at him, singing,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;With a bulrush for his spear, and a thimble
for a hat,<br />
Wilt thou fight a traverse with the castle cat.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come; &rsquo;tis too squashy here for
larking,&rsquo; he said authoritatively, stepping into the boat,
and bringing it up with such absence of effort that when a few
minutes after he had brought it to the landing-place, and the
freight was seated, Robert had no sooner taken the other oar than
he exclaimed at the force of the stream with which Owen had dealt
so easily, and Lucilla so coolly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It really was a fearful risk,&rsquo; he said
reproachfully to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I know my Thames, and my
Thames knows me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now&rsquo;s the time to improve it,&rsquo; said Owen;
&lsquo;one or other should preach about young ladies getting
loose, and not knowing where they may be brought up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you see I did know; besides, Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
news from Paris will be better worth hearing,&rsquo; said
Lucilla, tickling her friend&rsquo;s face with the soft long
point of her dark velvety mace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My news from Paris?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; Your face betrays
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy; how could you know?&nbsp; I had not even told
Miss Charlecote!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s true! it&rsquo;s true!&rsquo; cried
Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what I wanted to
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, then it was not fair,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
much discomposed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was desired to tell no one, and
you should not have betrayed me into doing so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, you always were a green oasis in a wicked
world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, let me hear,&rsquo; said Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t flatter you, Ph&oelig;be;
I thought you were labouring under a suppressed
secret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only since this morning,&rsquo; pleaded Ph&oelig;be,
earnestly; &lsquo;and we were expressly forbidden to mention it;
I cannot imagine how Lucy knows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By telegraph!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s face assumed an expression of immeasurable
wonder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I almost hope to find you at cross purposes, after
all,&rsquo; said Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No such good luck,&rsquo; laughed Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Cinderella&rsquo;s seniors never could go off two at a
time.&nbsp; Ah! there&rsquo;s the name.&nbsp; I beg your pardon,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>&lsquo;But, Lucy, what can you mean?&nbsp; Who can have
telegraphed about Augusta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you knew not the important interests involved, nor
Augusta how much depended on her keeping the worthy admiral in
play.&nbsp; It was the nearest thing&mdash;had she only consented
at the end of the evening instead of the beginning, poor Lord
William would have had the five guineas that he wants so much
more than Mr. Calthorp!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a bet that Sir Nicholas would take six calendar
months to supply the place of Lady Bannerman.&nbsp; It was the
very last day.&nbsp; If Augusta had only waited till
twelve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that he has been married
before.&nbsp; I thought he was such an excellent man!&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, in a voice that set others besides Lucilla off into
irresistible mirth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once, twice, thrice!&rsquo; cried Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Catch her, Honor, before she sinks into the river in
disgust with this treacherous world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know him, Lucy?&rsquo; earnestly said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and two of the wives; we used to visit them
because he was an old captain of Uncle Kit&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not believe in number three, Ph&oelig;be, if I
were you,&rsquo; said Owen, consolingly; &lsquo;she wants
confirmation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two are as bad as three,&rsquo; sighed Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;and Augusta did not even call him a widower.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cupid bandaged!&nbsp; It was a case of love at first
sight.&nbsp; Met at the <i>Trois Fr&egrave;res
Proven&ccedil;aux</i>, heard each other&rsquo;s critical remarks,
sought an introduction, compared notes; he discovered her
foresight with regard to pale ale; each felt that here was a
kindred soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That could not have been telegraphed!&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, recovering spirit and incredulity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; the telegram was simply &ldquo;Bannerman,
Fulmort.&nbsp; 8.30 p.m., July 10th.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other
particulars followed by letter this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How old is he?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be, with
resignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any age above sixty.&nbsp; What, Ph&oelig;be, taking it
to heart?&nbsp; I was prepared with congratulations.&nbsp; It is
only second best, to be sure; but don&rsquo;t you see your own
emancipation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe that had never occurred to
Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, Lucy,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
thinking that she had appeared out of temper; &lsquo;only it had
sounded so nice in Augusta&rsquo;s letter, and she was so kind,
and somehow it jars that there should have been that sort of
talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cilly was checked.&nbsp; In her utter want of thought it had
not occurred to her that Augusta Fulmort could be other than a
laughing-stock, or that any bright anticipations could have been
spent by any reasonable person on her marriage.&nbsp; Perhaps the
companionship of Rashe, and the satirical outspoken tone of her
associates, had somewhat blunted her perception of what <!-- page
166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>might be offensive to the sensitive delicacy of a young
sister; but she instantly perceived her mistake, and the
carnation deepened in her cheek, at having distressed
Ph&oelig;be, and . . .&nbsp; Not that she had deigned any notice
of Robert after the first cold shake of the hand, and he sat
rowing with vigorous strokes, and a countenance of set gravity,
more as if he were a boatman than one of the party; Lucilla could
not even meet his eye when she peeped under her eyelashes to
recover defiance by the sight of his displeasure.</p>
<p>It was a relief to all when Honora exclaimed,
&lsquo;Wrapworth! how pretty it looks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was, indeed, pretty, seen through the archway of the
handsome stone bridge.&nbsp; The church tower and picturesque
village were set off by the frame that closed them in; and though
they lost somewhat of the enchantment when the boat shot from
under the arch, they were still a fair and goodly English
scene.</p>
<p>Lucilla steered towards the steps leading to a smooth shaven
lawn, shaded by a weeping willow, well known to Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here we land you and your bag, Robert,&rsquo; said
Owen, as he put in.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cilly, have a little sense,
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Lucilla, to the alarm of all, was already on her feet,
skipped like a chamois to the steps, and flew dancing up the
sward.&nbsp; Ere Owen and Robert had helped the other two ladies
to land in a more rational manner, she was shaking her
mischievous head at a window, and thrusting in her sceptral
reed-mace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neighbour, oh, neighbour, I&rsquo;m come to torment
you!&nbsp; Yes, here we are in full force, ladies and all, and
you must come out and behave pretty.&nbsp; Never mind your
slippers; you ought to be proud of the only thing I ever
worked.&nbsp; Come out, I say; here&rsquo;s your guest, and you
must be civil to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad to see Mr. Fulmort,&rsquo; said Mr.
Prendergast, his only answer in words to all this, though while
it was going on, as if she were pulling him by wires, as she
imperiously waved her bulrush, he had stuck his pen into the
inkstand, run his fingers in desperation through his hair, risen
from his seat, gazed about in vain for his boots, and felt as
fruitlessly on the back of the door for a coat to replace the
loose alpaca article that hung on his shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve gone through all the
motions,&rsquo; said Cilly; &lsquo;that&rsquo;ll do; now, come
out and receive them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, he issued from the door, shy and slouching; rusty
where he wore cloth, shiny where he wore alpaca, wild as to his
hair, gay as to his feet, but, withal, the scholarly gentleman
complete, and not a day older or younger, apparently, than when
Honor had last seen him, nine years since, in bondage then to the
child playing at coquetry, as now to the coquette playing at
childhood.&nbsp; It was curious, Honor thought, to see how,
though so much more uncouth and negligent than Robert, the
indefinable signs of good blood made themselves visible, <!--
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>while they were wanting in one as truly the Christian
gentleman in spirit and in education.</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast bowed to Miss Charlecote, and shook hands with
his guest, welcoming him kindly; but the two shy men grew more
bashful by contact, and Honor found herself, Owen, and Lucilla
sustaining the chief of the conversation, the curate apparently
looking to the young lady to protect him and do the honours, as
she did by making him pull down a cluster of his roses for her
companions, and conducting them to eat his strawberries, which
she treated as her own, flitting, butterfly like, over the beds,
selecting the largest and ruddiest specimens, while her slave
plodded diligently to fill cabbage leaves, and present them to
the party in due gradation.</p>
<p>Owen stood by amused, and silencing the scruples of his
companions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is in Elysium,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;he had rather
be plagued by Cilly than receive a mitre!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
hinder him, Honey; it is his pride to treat us as if we were at
home and he our guest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wrapworth has not been seen without Edna
Murrell,&rsquo; said Lucilla, flinging the stem of her last
strawberry at her brother, &lsquo;and Miss Charlecote is a woman
of schools.&nbsp; What, aren&rsquo;t we to go, Mr.
Prendergast?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I did not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do sometimes wish Miss Murrell were not such an
attraction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not think that of yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; Miss Murrell is a very nice
young woman,&rsquo; he hesitated, as Cilly seemed about to thrust
him through with her reed; &lsquo;but couldn&rsquo;t you, Cilla,
now, give her a hint that it would be better if she would
associate more with Mrs. Jenkyns, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t Mr. Prendergast; I&rsquo;ve more regard
for doing as I would be done by.&nbsp; When you see Edna,
Honor&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are very respectable women,&rsquo; said the
curate, standing his ground; &lsquo;and it would be much better
for her than letting it be said she gives herself
airs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all because we have had her up to the
castle to sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, so it is, I believe.&nbsp; They do say,
too&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is so&mdash;that the work
has not been so well attended to, nor the children so
orderly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spite, spite, Mr. Prendergast; I had a better opinion
of you than to think you could be taken in by the tongues of
Wrapworth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, certainly I did hear a great noise the other
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see how it is!&nbsp; This is a systematic attempt to
destroy the impression I wished to produce.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He tried to argue that he thought very well of Miss Murrell,
but she would not hear; and she went on with her pretty, saucy
abuse, in her gayest tones, as she tripped along the churchyard
path, now, doubtless, too familiar to renew the associations that
might have tamed her spirits.&nbsp; Perhaps the shock her <!--
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>vivacity gave to the feeling of her friends was hardly
reasonable, but it was not the less real; though, even in
passing, Honora could not but note the improved condition of the
two graves, now carefully tended, and with a lovely white rose
budding between them.</p>
<p>A few more steps, and from the open window of the schoolhouse
there was heard a buzz and hum, not outrageous, but which might
have caused the item of discipline not to figure well in an
inspector&rsquo;s report; but Mr. Prendergast and Lucilla
appeared habituated to the like, for they proceeded without
apology.</p>
<p>It was a handsome gable-ended building, Elizabethan enough to
testify to the taste that had designed it, and with a deep porch,
where Honor had advanced, under Lucilla&rsquo;s guidance, so as
to have a moment&rsquo;s view of the whole scene before their
arrival had disturbed it.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s backs were towards the door, as they sat
on their forms at work.&nbsp; Close to the oriel window, the only
person facing the door, with a table in front of her, there sat,
in a slightly reclining attitude, a figure such as all reports of
the new race of schoolmistresses had hardly led Honor to imagine
to be the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> mistress.&nbsp; Yet the dress
was perfectly quiet, merely lilac cotton, with no ornament save
the small bow of the same colour at the throat, and the hair was
simply folded round the head, but it was magnificent raven hair;
the head and neck were grandly made; the form finely
proportioned, on a large scale; the face really beautiful, in a
pale, dark, Italian style; the complexion of the clearest olive,
but as she became aware of the presence of the visitors it became
overspread with a lovely hue of red; while the eyelids revealed a
superb pair of eyes, liquid depths of rich brown, soft and
languid, and befitting the calm dignity with which she rose,
curtseyed, and signed to her scholars to do the same; the
deepening colour alone betraying any sense of being taken by
surprise.</p>
<p>Lucilla danced up to her, chattering with her usual familiar,
airy grace.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, Edna, how are you getting
on?&nbsp; Have I brought a tremendous host to invade you?&nbsp; I
wanted Miss Charlecote to see you, for she is a perfect
connoisseur in schools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edna&rsquo;s blush grew more carnation, and the fingers shook
so visibly with which she held the work, that Honora was provoked
with Lucy for embarrassing the poor young thing by treating her
as an exhibition, especially as the two young gentlemen were
present, Robert with his back against the door-post in a state of
resignation, Owen drawing Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s attention to the
little ones whom he was puzzling with incomprehensible remarks
and questions.&nbsp; Hoping to end the scene, Honor made a few
commonplace inquiries as to the numbers and the habits of the
school; but the mistress, though preserving her dignity of
attitude, seemed hardly able to speak, and the curate replied for
her.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Lucilla, &lsquo;your eye
keeps roaming to the mischief my naughty brother is doing among
the fry down there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no! ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I beg your
pardon&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll remove the whole concern in a
moment, only we must have some singing first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Lucy!&rsquo; whispered Honor, looking up
from an inspection of some not first-rate needlework; &lsquo;it
is distressing her, and displays are contrary to all rules of
discipline.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! but you must,&rsquo; cried Cilly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have not seen Wrapworth without.&nbsp; Come, Edna, my
bonnie-bell,&rsquo; and she held out her hand in that
semi-imperious, semi-caressing manner which very few had ever
withstood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One song,&rsquo; echoed Owen, turning towards the elder
girls.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you&rsquo;ll oblige me; eh, Fanny
Blake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the scholars the request was evidently not distasteful; the
more tuneful were gathering together, and the mistress took her
station among them, all as if the exhibition were no
novelty.&nbsp; Lucilla, laying her hand on the victim&rsquo;s
arm, said, &lsquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be nervous, or what will you
do to-morrow?&nbsp; Come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Goddess of the Silver Bow,&rdquo;&rsquo;
suggested Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it that which your
mother disapproved, Fanny, because it was worshipping idols to
sing about great Diana of the Ephesians?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said rather a conceited voice from the
prettiest of the elder girls; &lsquo;and you told us it was about
Ph&oelig;be Bright, and gave her the blue and silver
ribbon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And please, sir,&rsquo; said another less prepossessing
damsel, &lsquo;Mrs. Jenkyns took it away, and I said I&rsquo;d
tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen shrugged up his shoulders with a comical look, saying, as
he threw her a shilling, &lsquo;Never mind; there&rsquo;s a
silver circle instead of a bow&mdash;that will do as well.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s a rival goddess for you, Ph&oelig;be; two moons in a
system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girls were in a universal titter, the mistress with her
eyes cast down, blushing more than ever.&nbsp; Lucilla muttered
an amused but indignant, &lsquo;For shame, Owen!&rsquo; and
herself gave the key-note.&nbsp; The performance was not above
the average of National School melody, but no sooner was it over,
than Owen named, in an under-tone, another song, which was
instantly commenced, and in which there joined a voice that had
been still during the first, but which soon completely took the
lead.&nbsp; And such a voice, coming as easily as the notes of
the nightingale from the nobly-formed throat, and seeming to fill
the room with its sweet power!&nbsp; Lucilla&rsquo;s triumph was
complete; Honor&rsquo;s scruples were silenced by the admiring
enjoyment, and Ph&oelig;be was in a state of rapture.&nbsp; The
nervous reluctance had given way to the artistic delight in her
own power, and she readily sang all that was asked for, latterly
such pieces as needed little or no support from the
children&mdash;the &lsquo;Three Fishers&rsquo; Wives&rsquo;
coming last, and thrilling every one with the wondrous pathos and
sadness of the tones that seemed to come from her very heart.</p>
<p>It seemed as if they would never have come away, had not <!--
page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Mr. Prendergast had pity on the restless movements of
some of the younglings, who, taking no part in the display, had
leisure to perceive that the clock had struck their hour of
release, and at the close of &lsquo;The Fishers&rsquo;
Wives,&rsquo; he signed to Lucilla to look at the hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little things!&rsquo; said she, turning round to
the gaping and discontented collection, &lsquo;have we used you
so ill?&nbsp; Never mind.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again using her bulrush to
tickle the faces that looked most injured, and waken them into
smiles&mdash;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the prison house open,&rsquo;
and she sprang out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now&mdash;come with a whoop and
come with a call&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give my club to anybody that
can catch me before I get down to the vicarage garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Light as the wind, she went bounding flying across the
churchyard like a butterfly, ever and anon pausing to look round,
nod, and shake her sceptre, as the urchins tumbled confusedly
after, far behind, till closing the gate, she turned, poised the
reed javelin-wise in the air, and launched it among them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is vain to try to collect them again,&rsquo; sighed
Mr. Prendergast; &lsquo;we must shut up.&nbsp; Good night, Miss
Murrell;&rsquo; and therewith he turned back to his garden, where
the freakish sprite, feigning flight, took refuge in the boat,
cowering down, and playfully hiding her face in deprecation of
rebuke, but all she received was a meekly melancholy, &lsquo;O
Cilla! prayers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day&rsquo;s less loathing of compulsory
devotion,&rsquo; was her answer in saucy defiance.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
owed it to them for the weariness of listening for ten minutes to
the &ldquo;Three Fishers&rsquo; Wives,&rdquo; which they
appreciated as little as their pastor did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing about songs, but when one wants
them&mdash;poor things&mdash;to look to something better than
sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, hush!&nbsp; Here are Miss Charlecote and Mr.
Fulmort on your side, and I can&rsquo;t be crushed with united
morality in revenge for the tears Edna caused you all to
shed.&nbsp; There, help Miss Charlecote in; where can Owen be
dawdling?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t pull, Ph&oelig;be, or we would
put off without him.&nbsp; Ah, there!&rsquo; as he came bounding
down, &lsquo;you intolerable loiterer, I was just going to leave
you behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The train starting without the engine,&rsquo; he said,
getting into his place; &lsquo;yes, take an oar if you like,
little gnat, and fancy yourself helping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gay warfare, accompanied by a few perilous tricks on
Lucilla&rsquo;s part, lasted through the further voyage.&nbsp;
Honora guessed at a purpose of staving off graver remonstrance,
but Ph&oelig;be looked on in astonishment.&nbsp; Seventeen is
often a more serious time of life than two-and twenty, and the
damsel could not comprehend the possibility of thoughtlessness
when there was anything to think about.&nbsp; The ass&rsquo;s
bridge was nothing compared with Lucy!&nbsp; Moreover the habits
of persiflage of a lively family often are confusing to one not
used to the tone of jest and repartee, and Ph&oelig;be had as
little power as will to take part in what was passing between the
brother and sister; she <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>sat like
the spectator of a farce in a foreign tongue, till the boat had
arrived at the broad open extent of park gently sweeping down
towards the river, the masses of trees kept on either side so as
to leave the space open where the castle towered in pretentious
grandeur, with a flag slowly swaying in the summer wind on the
top of the tallest turret.</p>
<p>The trees made cool reaches of shade, varied by intervals of
hot sunshine, and much longer did the way appear, creeping onward
in the heat, than it had looked when the eye only took in the
simple expanse of turf, from river to castle.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be
looked to her arrival there, and to bedroom conferences, as the
moment of recovering a reasonable Lucy, but as they neared the
house, there was a shout from the wire fence enclosing the
shrubbery on the eastern side, and Horatia was seen standing at
the gate calling them to come into the cloisters and have some
sustenance.</p>
<p>Passing the screen of shrubs, a scene lay before them almost
fit for the gardens of Seville.&nbsp; Three sides of an extensive
square were enclosed by the semi-gothic buildings, floridly
decorated with stone carving; one consisted of the main edifice,
the lower windows tented with striped projecting blinds; a second
of the wing containing the reception rooms, fronted by the
imitative cloister, which was continued and faced with glass on
the third side&mdash;each supporting column covered with climbing
plants, the passion-flower, the trop&aelig;olum, the trumpet
honeysuckle, or even the pomegranate, opening their gay blooms on
every side.&nbsp; The close-shaven turf was broken by small
patches of gorgeously-tinted flower-beds, diversified by vases
filled with trailing plants, and lines of orange trees and
fuchsias, with here and there a deep-belled datura, all
converging towards the central marble fountain, where the water
played high, and tinkled coolly in sparkling jets.&nbsp; Between
it and the house, there were placed in the shade some
brightly-tinted cushions and draperies, lounging chairs, and a
low table, bearing an oriental-looking service of tiny cups, of
all kinds of bright and fantastic hues, no two alike.&nbsp; Near
it reclined on her cushions a figure in perfect keeping with the
scene, her jetty hair contrasting with her gold and coral net,
her scarlet gold-embroidered slipper peeping out from her pale
buff-coloured dress, deeply edged with rich purple, and partly
concealed by a mantle of the unapproachable pink which suggests
Persia, all as gorgeous in apparel as the blue and yellow macaw
on his pole, and the green and scarlet lories in their
cage.&nbsp; Owen made a motion of smoking with Honor&rsquo;s
parasol, whispering, &lsquo;Fair Fatima! what more is
wanting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! I&rsquo;ve got Lolly out!&rsquo; cried Horatia,
advancing with her vehement cordiality, and grasping their hands
with all her might; &lsquo;I would have come and pulled you up
the river, Miss Charlecote, but for imperative claims.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s some tea for you; I know you must be
parched.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>And while Mrs. Charteris, scarcely rising, held out her
ring encrusted fingers, and murmured a greeting, Ratia settled
them all, pushed a chair behind Miss Charlecote, almost threw
Ph&oelig;be on a cushion, handed tea, scolded Owen, and rattled
away to Lucilla with an impetus that kept Ph&oelig;be in
increased wonder.&nbsp; It was all about the arrangements for the
morrow, full of the utmost good-nature and desire to secure every
one&rsquo;s pleasure, but all discussed in a broad out-spoken
way, with a liberal use of slang phrases, and of unprefaced
surnames, a freedom of manner and jovial carelessness of voice
that specially marked Rashe Charteris at home.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had a good deal of opportunity for these
observations, for as soon as her stream of information was
exhausted, Rashe jumped up and insisted on conducting the guests
round the hothouses and pleasure-grounds.&nbsp; She knew Miss
Charlecote was a famous hand at such things.&nbsp; Lucilla
remained on the grass, softly teasing Lolly about the exertions
of the morrow, and Owen applying himself to the care of Honor,
Rashe took possession of Ph&oelig;be with all the tyrannous
good-nature that had in baby days rendered her hateful to
Lucilla.&nbsp; She showed off the parrots and gold fish as to a
child, she teased the sensitive plant, and explained curiosities
down to the level of the youthful intellect; and Ph&oelig;be,
scientific enough to know if she went wrong in botany or
locality, began a word or two of modest suggestion, only to be
patronizingly enlightened, and stopped short, in the fear of
pedantry.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be had yet to learn the ignorance of the
world.</p>
<p>At last, with a huge torrent of explanations and excuses,
Ratia consigned the two guests to share the same bedroom and
dressing-room.&nbsp; The number of gentlemen visitors had
necessitated close packing, and Cilly, she said, had come to
sleep in her room.&nbsp; Another hope had failed!&nbsp; But at
the moment when the door was shut, Ph&oelig;be could only sink
into a chair, untie her bonnet, and fan herself.&nbsp; Such
oppressive good-nature was more fatiguing than a ten miles&rsquo;
walk, or than the toughest lesson in political economy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If nature have her own ladies,&rsquo; was
Honora&rsquo;s comment on her young friend&rsquo;s exhaustion,
&lsquo;she likewise has her own dairy-maids!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charteris is a lady,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, her
sense of the intended kindness of her hostess calling her to
speak in vindication.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Honor, hesitating; &lsquo;it is
station that emboldens her.&nbsp; If she had been a dairy-maid,
she would have been a bouncing rude girl; if a farmer&rsquo;s
daughter, she would be hearty and useful; if one of the boasters
of gentility, she would think it worth while to restrain herself;
as she is, her acknowledged birth and breeding enable her to
follow her inclinations without fear of opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought refinement was one great characteristic of a
lady,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it is, but affectation and false shame are the
contrary.&nbsp; <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Refinement was rather overworked,
and there has been a reaction of late; simplicity and
unconstraint have been the fashion, but unfortunately some
dispositions are not made to be unconstrained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy is just as unrestrained as her cousin,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;but she never seems like her.&nbsp; She
offends one&rsquo;s judgment sometimes, but never one&rsquo;s
taste&mdash;at least hardly ever;&rsquo; and Ph&oelig;be blushed
as she thought of what had passed about her sister that day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Lucy! it is one misfortune of pretty people, that
they can seldom do what is taken amiss.&nbsp; She is small and
feminine too, and essentially refined, whatever she can do.&nbsp;
But I was very sorry for you to-day, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Tell me
all about your sister, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They knew more than I did, if all that is true,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Augusta wrote&mdash;oh! so
kindly&mdash;and seemed so glad, that it made me very
happy.&nbsp; And papa gave his consent readily to Robert&rsquo;s
doing as he pleased, and almost said something about his taking
me to the wedding at Paris.&nbsp; If Lucy should&mdash;should
accept Robin, I wonder if she would go too, and be
bridesmaid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they comforted themselves with a few pretty auguries,
dressed, and went down to dinner, where Ph&oelig;be had made sure
that, as before, Lucy would sit next Robin, and be subdued.&nbsp;
Alas, no!&nbsp; Ladies were far too scarce articles for even the
last but one to be the prize of a mere B.A.&nbsp; To know who
were Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s own neighbours would have been
distraction to Juliana, but they were lost on one in whom the art
of conversation was yet undeveloped, and who was chiefly intent
on reading her brother&rsquo;s face, and catching what Lucy was
saying.&nbsp; She had nearly given up listening in despair, when
she heard, &lsquo;Pistols? oh, of course.&nbsp; Rashe has gone to
the expense of a revolver, but I extracted grandpapa&rsquo;s from
the family armoury&mdash;such little darlings.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
strongly tempted to send a challenge, just to keep them in
use&mdash;that&rsquo;s because you despise me&mdash;I&rsquo;m a
crack shot&mdash;we practised every day last winter&mdash;women
shoot much better than men, because they don&rsquo;t make their
hands unsteady&mdash;what can be better than the guidance of
Ratia, the feminine of Ratio, reason, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is not quite certain that this horrible Latinity did not
shock Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s discreet pupil more than all the
rest, as a wilful insult to Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
education!</p>
<p>She herself was not to escape &lsquo;the guidance of
Ratia,&rsquo; after dinner.&nbsp; Her silence had been an
additional proof to the good-natured Rashe that she was a child
to be protected and entertained, so she paraded her through the
rooms, coaxed her to play when no one was listening, showed her
illustrated books and new-fashioned puzzles, and domineered over
her so closely, that she had not a moment in which to speak a
word to her brother, whom she saw disconsolately watching the
hedge of <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>gentlemen round Lucy.&nbsp; Was it
wrong to feel so ungrateful to a person exclusively devoted to
her entertainment for that entire evening?</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had never known a room-mate nor the solace of a
bed-time gossip, and by the time Miss Charlecote began to think
of opening the door between their rooms, and discussing the
disgusts of the day, the sounds of moving about had ceased.&nbsp;
Honor looked in, and could not help advancing to the bedside to
enjoy the sight of the rosy face in the sound healthful sleep,
the lips unclosed, and the silken brown hair wound plainly across
the round brow, the childish outline and expression of the
features even sweeter in sleep than awake.&nbsp; It rested
Honora&rsquo;s wearied anxious spirit to watch the perfect repose
of that innocent young face, and she stood still for some
minutes, breathing an ejaculation that the child might ever be as
guileless and peaceful as now, and then sighing at the thought of
other young sleepers, beside whose couches even fonder prayers
had been uttered, only, as it seemed, to be blown aside.</p>
<p>She was turning away, when Ph&oelig;be suddenly awoke, and was
for a moment startled, half rising, asking if anything were the
matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear; only I did not think you would have been
in bed so quickly.&nbsp; I came to wish you good night, and found
you asleep.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with the strong tender impulse of a
gentle wounded spirit, Honor hung over the maiden, recomposing
the clothes, and fondling her, with a murmured blessing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; whispered Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;how nice it is!&nbsp; I have so often wondered what it
would be like, if any one came in to pet us at night, as they do
in books; and oh! it is so nice!&nbsp; Say <i>that</i> again,
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>That</i> was the blessing which would have made Lucilla in
angry reserve hide her head in the clothes!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<blockquote><p>But, ah me! she&rsquo;s a heart of stone,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Breakfast was late, and lengthened out by the greater lateness
of many of the guests, and the superlative tardiness of the lady
of the house, who had repudiated the cares of the hostess, and
left the tea-equipage to her sister-in-law.&nbsp; Lucilla had
been down-stairs among the first, and hurried away again after a
rapid meal, forbidding any one to follow her, because she had so
much to do, and on entering the drawing-room, she was found with
a wilderness of flowers around her, filling vases and making last
arrangements.</p>
<p><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>Honora and Ph&oelig;be were glad to be occupied, and
Ph&oelig;be almost hoped to escape from Rashe.&nbsp; Speaking to
Lucilla was not possible, for Elo&iuml;sa had been placed by
Rashe in a low chair, with a saucer before her, which she was
directed to fill with verbenas, while the other four ladies, with
Owen, whom his cousin had called to their aid, were putting last
touches to wreaths, and giving the final festal air to the
rooms.</p>
<p>Presently Robert made his appearance as the bearer of Mr.
Prendergast&rsquo;s flowers, and setting his back against a
shutter, in his favourite attitude, stood looking as if he wanted
to help, but knew not how.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, at least, was
vividly conscious of his presence, but she was supporting a long
festoon with which Owen was adorning a pier-glass, and could
hardly even turn her head to watch him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, horrid!&rsquo; cried Lucilla, retreating backwards
to look at Ratia&rsquo;s performance; &lsquo;for love or money a
bit of clematis!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where shall I find one?&rsquo; said Robert, unseeing
the masses waving on the cloister, if, good youth, he even knew
what clematis was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You there, Mr. Fulmort!&rsquo; exclaimed Rashe;
&lsquo;for goodness gracious sake, go out to tennis or something
with the other men.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ordered them all out, or
there&rsquo;ll be no good to be got out of Cilly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be flashed out in his defence, &lsquo;You are letting
Owen alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! by the bye, that wreath of yours has taken an
unconscionable time!&rsquo; said Miss Charteris, beginning to
laugh; but Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s grave straightforward eyes met her
with such a look, as absolutely silenced her merriment into a
mere mutter of &lsquo;What a little chit it is!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Honora, who was about indignantly to assume the protection of her
charge, recognized in her what was fully competent to take care
of herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Away with both of you,&rsquo; said Lucilla; &lsquo;here
is Edna come for a last rehearsal, and I won&rsquo;t have you
making her nervous.&nbsp; Take away that Robin, will you,
Owen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Horatia flew gustily to greet and reassure the schoolmistress
as she entered, trembling, although moving with the dignity that
seemed to be her form of embarrassment.&nbsp; Lucilla meanwhile
sped to the others near the window.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must
go,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;or I shall never screw her up; it is
a sudden access of stage fright.&nbsp; She is as pale as
death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen stepped back to judge of the paleness, and Robert
contrived to say, &lsquo;Cannot you grant me a few words,
Lucy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The most impossible thing you could have asked,&rsquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Rashe&rsquo;s
encouragement quite done for her now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She bounded back to the much-overcome Edna, while Ph&oelig;be
herself, perceiving how ill-advised an opportunity Robert had
chosen, stepped out with him into the cloister, saying,
&lsquo;She can&rsquo;t help it, dear Robin; she cannot think,
just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When can she?&rsquo; he asked, almost with
asperity.</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&lsquo;Think how full her hands are, how much excited
she is,&rsquo; pleaded Ph&oelig;be, feeling that this was no fair
moment for the crisis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ireland?&rsquo; almost groaned Robert, but at the same
moment grasped her roughly to hinder her from replying, for Owen
was close upon them, and he was the person to whom Robert would
have been most reluctant to display his feelings.</p>
<p>Catching intuitively at his meaning, Ph&oelig;be directed her
attention to some clematis on the opposite side of the cloister,
and called both her companions to gather it for her, glad to be
with Robert and to relieve Miss Murrell of the presence of
another spectator.&nbsp; Charles Charteris coming up, carried the
two young men to inspect some of his doings out of doors, and
Ph&oelig;be returned with her wreaths of creepers to find that
the poor schoolmistress had become quite hysterical, and had been
take away by Lucilla.</p>
<p>Rashe summoned her at the same time to the decoration of the
music-room, and on entering, stopped in amusement, and made her a
sign in silence to look into a large pier-glass, which stood so
as to reflect through an open door what was passing in the little
fanciful boudoir beyond, a place fitted like a tent, and full of
quaint Dresden china and toys of <i>bijouterie</i>.&nbsp; There
was a complete picture within the glass.&nbsp; Lucilla, her fair
face seen in profile, more soft and gentle than she often allowed
it to appear, was kneeling beside the couch where half reclined
the tall, handsome Edna, whose raven hair, and pale, fine
features made her like a heroine, as she nervously held the hands
which Lucilla had placed within her grasp.&nbsp; There was a low
murmur of voices, one soothing, the other half sobbing, but
nothing reached the outer room distinctly, till, as Ph&oelig;be
was holding a long wreath, which Ratia was tying up, she
heard&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! but it is so different with me from you
young ladies who are used to company and all.&nbsp; I dare say
that young lady would not be timid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What young lady, Edna?&nbsp; Not the one with the
auburn hair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ratia made an ecstatic face which disgusted Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&mdash;the young lady whom Mr. Sandbrook was
helping.&nbsp; I dare say she would not mind singing&mdash;or
anything,&rsquo; came amid sobs.</p>
<p>Ratia nodded, looked excessively arch, and formed a word with
her lips, which Ph&oelig;be thought was &lsquo;jealous,&rsquo;
but could not imagine what she could mean by it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you should think poor
Ph&oelig;be Fulmort so brazen.&nbsp; She is a mere child, taking
a holiday from her strict governess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed back an answer to Rashe&rsquo;s pantomime,
which in this case she understood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has not had half your training in boldness, with
your inspectors and examinations, and all those horrid
things.&nbsp; Why, <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>you never thought of taking fright
before, even when you have sung to people here.&nbsp; Why should
you now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so different, now&mdash;so many more
people.&nbsp; Oh, so different!&nbsp; I shall never be
able.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; You will quite forget all about
yourself and your fears when the time comes.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know the exhilaration of a room full of people, all
lights and music!&nbsp; That symphony will lift you into another
world, and you will feel quite ready for &ldquo;Men must work and
women must weep.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I can only begin&mdash;but oh! Miss Sandbrook, shall
you be far away from me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I promise you not.&nbsp; I will bring you down, if
you will come to Ratia&rsquo;s room when you are dressed.&nbsp;
The black silk and the lilac ribbon Owen and I chose for you; I
must see you in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Miss Sandbrook, you are so kind!&nbsp; What shall
I do when you have left?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going yourself for the holidays, silly
puss!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but no one else sympathizes or enters into my
feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feelings!&rsquo; said Lucilla, lightly, yet
sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t indulge in them, Edna; they are
no end of a torment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but if they prey on one, one cannot help
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rashe made a face of great distaste.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be felt as
if it were becoming too confidential to permit of listening, all
the more as she heard Lucilla&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of being tall, and stately, and
dignified!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s so much less of me that I can
carry off my troubles twice as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear Miss Sandbrook, you can have no
troubles!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; Oh, Edna, if you knew!&nbsp; You
that have a mother can never know what it is to be like me!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m keeping it all at bay, lest I should break down; but
I&rsquo;m in the horridest bother and trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not knowing what might come next, ashamed of having listened
to so much, yet with one gleam of renewed hope, Ph&oelig;be
resolutely disobeyed Ratia&rsquo;s frowns and gestures, and made
her presence known by decided movements and words spoken
aloud.</p>
<p>She saw the immediate effect in Edna Murrell&rsquo;s violent
start; but Lucilla, without moving, at once began to sing,
straining her thin though sweet voice, as though to surmount a
certain tremulousness.&nbsp; Edna joined, and the melody was
lovely to hear; but Ph&oelig;be was longing all the time for
Robert to be at hand for this softer moment, and she hoped all
the more when, the practising being over, and Edna dismissed,
Lucy came springing towards her, notifying her presence by a
caress&mdash;to outward appearance merely playful, but in reality
a convulsive clasp of vehement affection&mdash;and Ph&oelig;be
was sure that there had been tears in those eyes that seemed to
do nothing but laugh.</p>
<p>The security that this wild elf was true at heart was,
however, <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>not enough for Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
There was the knowledge that each moment&rsquo;s delay would
drive Robert farther aloof, and that it was a mere chance whether
he should encounter this creature of impulse at a propitious
instant.&nbsp; Nay, who could tell what was best for him after
all?&nbsp; Even Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s faithful acceptance of her on
his word had undergone sundry severe shocks, and she had rising
doubts whether Lucy, such as she saw her, could be what would
make him happy.</p>
<p>If the secrets of every guest at a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> were
told, would any be found unmixedly happy?&nbsp; Would there be no
one devoid of cares of their own or of other people&rsquo;s, or
if exempt from these, undisturbed by the absence of the right
individual or by the presence of the wrong one, by mishaps of
deportment, difficulties of dress, or want of notice?&nbsp;
Perhaps, after all, it may be best to have some one abiding
anxiety, strong enough to destroy tedium, and exclude the pettier
distresses, which are harder to contend with, though less
dignified; and most wholesome of all is it that this should be an
interest entirely external.&nbsp; So, after all,
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s enjoyment might hardly have been increased
had her thoughts been more free from Robin&rsquo;s troubles, when
she came down dressed for her first party, so like a lily of the
valley in her delicate dress, that Owen acknowledged that it
justified her choice, and murmured something of &lsquo;in vernal
green and virgin white, her festal robes, arrayed.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be was only distressed at what she thought the
profanation of quoting from such a source in compliment to
her.&nbsp; Honora was gratified to find the lines in his memory
upon any terms.&nbsp; Poor dear Honor, in one case at least
believing all things, hoping all things!</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be ought to have made the most of her
compliment.&nbsp; It was all she obtained in that line.&nbsp;
Juliana herself could not have taken umbrage at her
success.&nbsp; Nobody imagined her come out, no one attempted to
disturb her from under Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s wing, and she kept
close to her the whole afternoon, sometimes sitting upon a
haycock, sometimes walking in the shrubbery, listening to the
band, or looking at the archery, in company with dignified
clergyman, or elderly lady, astonished to meet Honor Charlecote
in so unwonted a scene.&nbsp; Owen Sandbrook was never far
off.&nbsp; He took them to eat ices, conducted them to good
points of view, found seats for them, and told them who every one
was, with droll comments or anecdotes which entertained them so
much, that Ph&oelig;be almost wished that Robin had not made her
sensible of the grain of irreverence that seasoned all
Owen&rsquo;s most brilliant sallies.</p>
<p>They saw little of the others.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Charteris
walked about together, the one cordial, the other stately and
gorgeous, and Miss Charlecote came in for her due and passing
share of their politeness.&nbsp; Rashe once invited Ph&oelig;be
to shoot, but had too many on her hands to be solicitous about
one.&nbsp; Flirting no longer herself, Rashe&rsquo;s delight was
in those who did flirt, and in any assembly her extreme and
unscrupulous good-nature made <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>her
invaluable to all who wanted to have themselves taken off their
own hands, or pushed into those of others.&nbsp; She ordered
people about, started amusements, hunted gentlemen up, found
partners, and shook up the bashful.&nbsp; Rashe Charteris was the
life of everything.&nbsp; How little was wanting to make her
kind-hearted activity admirable!</p>
<p>Lucilla never came in their way at all.&nbsp; She was only
seen in full and eager occupation embellishing the archery, or
forcing the &lsquo;decidedly pious&rsquo; to be fascinated by her
gracious self-adaptation.&nbsp; Robert was equally inaccessible,
always watching her, but keeping aloof from his sister, and only
consorting at times with Mr. Prendergast.</p>
<p>It was seven o&rsquo;clock when this act of the drama was
finally over, and the parties staying in the house met round a
hurried meal.&nbsp; Rashe lounging and yawning, laughing and
quizzing, in a way amazing to Ph&oelig;be; Lucilla in the very
summit of spirits, rattling and laughing away in full
swing.&nbsp; Thence the party dispersed to dress, but Honora had
no sooner reached her room than she said, &lsquo;I must go and
find Lucy.&nbsp; I must do my duty by her, little hope as I
have.&nbsp; She has avoided me all day; I must seek her
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What a difference time and discipline had made in one formerly
so timid and gentle as to be alarmed at the least encounter, and
nervous at wandering about a strange house.&nbsp; Nervous and
frightened, indeed, she still was, but self-control kept this in
check, and her dislike was not allowed to hold her back from her
duty.&nbsp; Humfrey&rsquo;s representative was seldom permitted
to be weak.&nbsp; But there are times when the difference between
man and woman is felt in their dealings with others.&nbsp;
Strength can be mild, but what is strained can seldom be gentle,
and when she knocked at Horatia Charteris&rsquo;s door, her face,
from very unhappiness and effort, was sorrowfully reproachful, as
she felt herself an unwelcome apparition to the two cousins, who
lay on their bed still laughing over the day&rsquo;s events.</p>
<p>Rashe, who was still in her morning dress, at once gave way,
saying she must go and speak to Lolly, and hastened out of the
room.&nbsp; Lucy, in her dishabille, sat crouched upon the bed,
her white bare shoulders and floating hair, together with the
defiant glance of the blue eye, and the hand moodily compressing
the lips, reminding Honor of the little creature who had been
summarily carried into her house sixteen years since.&nbsp; She
came towards her, but there was no invitation to give the caress
that she yearned to bestow, and she leant against the bed,
trembling, as she said, &lsquo;Lucy, my poor child, I am come
that you may not throw away your last chance without knowing
it.&nbsp; You do not realize what you are about.&nbsp; If you
cast aside esteem and reliance, how can you expect to retain the
affection you sometimes seem to prize?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I am not trusted, what&rsquo;s the good of
affection?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you expect trust when you go beyond the bounds
<!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>of discretion?&rsquo; said Honor, with voice scarcely
steadied into her desired firmness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can, I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, listen to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; She gave way to her
natural piteous, pleading tone: &lsquo;I verily believe that this
is the very turn.&nbsp; Remember how often a moment has decided
the fate of a life!&rsquo;&nbsp; She saw the expression relax
into some alarm, and continued: &lsquo;The Fulmorts do not say
so, but I see by their manner that his final decision will be
influenced by your present proceedings.&nbsp; You have trifled
with him too long, and with his mind made up to the ministry, he
cannot continue to think of one who persists in outraging
decorum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those words were effort enough, and had better have been
unsaid.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is as people may think,&rsquo; was all
the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As he thinks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do I know what he thinks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heartsick at such mere fencing, Honor was silent at first,
then said, &lsquo;I, for one, shall rate your good opinion by
your endeavour to deserve it.&nbsp; Who can suppose that you
value what you are willing to risk for an unladylike bet, or an
unfeminine sporting expedition!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may tell him so,&rsquo; said Lucilla, her voice
quivering with passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think a look will bring him back, but you may find
that a true man is no slave.&nbsp; Prove his affection misplaced,
and he will tear it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Had Honora been discreet as she was good, she would have left
those words to settle down; but, woman that she was, she knew not
when to stop, and coaxingly coming to the small bundle of
perverseness, she touched the shoulder, and said, &lsquo;Now you
won&rsquo;t make an object of yourself to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shoulder shook in the old fashion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At least you will not go to Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I shall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote, I beg your pardon&mdash;&rsquo; cried
Rashe, bursting in&mdash;(oh! that she had been five seconds
earlier)&mdash;&lsquo;but dressing is imperative.&nbsp; People
are beginning to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora retreated in utter discomfiture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rashe!&nbsp; Rashe!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in for it!&rsquo;
cried Lucilla, as the door shut, springing up with a look of
terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Proposed by deputy?&rsquo; exclaimed Horatia,
aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; gasped Lucilla; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s this
Ireland of yours&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;&rsquo; and she
well-nigh sobbed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My bonny bell!&nbsp; I knew you would not be bullied
into deserting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Rashe, she was very hard on me.&nbsp; Every one is
but you!&rsquo; and Lucilla threw herself into her cousin&rsquo;s
arms in a paroxysm of feeling; but their maid&rsquo;s knock
brought her back to composure sooner than poor Honora, who shed
many a tear over this last defeat, as, looking mournfully to
Ph&oelig;be, she said, <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>&lsquo;I
have done, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; I can say no more to her.&nbsp; She
will not hear anything from me.&nbsp; Oh! what have I done that
my child should be hardened against me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could offer nothing but caresses full of indignant
sorrow, and there was evidently soothing in them, for Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s tears became softer, and she fondly smoothed
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s fair hair, saying, as she drew the clinging
arms closer round her: &lsquo;My little woodbine, you must twine
round your brother and comfort him, but you can spare some
sweetness for me too.&nbsp; There, I will dress.&nbsp; I will not
keep you from the party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not care for that; only to see Robin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must take our place in the crowd,&rsquo; sighed
Honora, beginning her toilet; &lsquo;and you will enjoy it when
you are there.&nbsp; Your first quadrille is promised to Owen, is
it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, dreamily, and she would
have gone back to Robin&rsquo;s sorrows, but Honora had learnt
that there were subjects to be set aside when it was incumbent on
her to be presentable, and directed the talk to speculations
whether the poor schoolmistress would have nerve to sing; and
somehow she talked up Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s spirits to such a
hopeful pitch, that the little maiden absolutely was crossed by a
gleam of satisfaction from the ungrateful recollection that poor
Miss Charlecote had done with the affair.&nbsp; Against her will,
she had detected the antagonism between the two, and bad as it
was of Lucy, was certain that she was more likely to be amenable
where there was no interference from her best friend.</p>
<p>The music-room was already crowded when the two made their way
into it, and Honora&rsquo;s inclination was to deposit herself on
the nearest seat, but she owed something otherwise to her young
charge, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eyes had already found a lonely
black figure with arms crossed, and lowering brow.&nbsp;
Simultaneously they moved towards him, and he towards them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is she come down?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be shook her head, but at the same moment another
door near the orchestra admitted a small white butterfly figure,
leading in a tall queenly apparition in black, whom she placed in
a chair adjacent to the bejewelled prima donna of the
night&mdash;a great contrast with her dust-coloured German hair
and complexion, and good-natured plain face.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s face cleared with relief; he evidently detected
nothing <i>outr&eacute;</i> in Lucilla&rsquo;s aspect, and was
rejoicing in the concession.&nbsp; Woman&rsquo;s eyes saw
further; a sigh from Honora, an amused murmur around him, caused
him to bend his looks on Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; She knew his eyes
were interrogating her, but could not bear to let her own reply,
and kept them on the ground.</p>
<p>He was moving towards Lucilla, who, having consigned her
<i>proteg&eacute;e</i> to the good-humoured German, had come more
among the guests, and was exchanging greetings and answering
comments with all her most brilliant airs of saucy animation.</p>
<p>And who could quarrel with that fairy vision?&nbsp; Her rich
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>double-skirted watered silk was bordered with
exquisitely made and coloured flies, radiant with the hues of the
peacock, the gold pheasant, the jay, parrots of all tints,
everything rich and rare in plumage.&nbsp; A coronal of the same
encircled her glossy hair, the tiny plumes contrasting with the
blonde ringlets, and the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> hooks
ostentatiously displayed; lesser and more innocuous flies edged
the sleeves, corsage, shoes, and gloves; and her fan, which she
used as skilfully as Jenny Wren, presented a Watteau-like picture
of an angling scene.&nbsp; Anything more daintily, quaintly
pretty could not be imagined, and the male part of the assembly
would have unanimously concurred in Sir Harry Buller&rsquo;s
&lsquo;three cheers for the queen of the anglers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But towards the party most concerned in her movements, Lucilla
came not; and Ph&oelig;be, understanding a desire to keep as near
as might be to Miss Murrell, tried to suggest it as the cause,
and looking round, saw Owen standing by Miss Charlecote, with
somewhat of an uneasy countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Terribly hot here,&rsquo; he said, restlessly;
&lsquo;suffocating, aren&rsquo;t you, Honor?&nbsp; Come and take
a turn in the cloister; the fountain is stunning by
moonlight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No proposal could have been more agreeable to Honora; and
Ph&oelig;be was afraid of losing her chaperon, though she would
rather have adhered to her brother, and the barbs of that wicked
little angler were tearing him far too deeply to permit him to
move out of sight of his tormentor.</p>
<p>But for this, the change would have been delicious.&nbsp; The
white lights and deep shadows from the calm, grave moon
contrasted with the long gleams of lamp-light from every window,
reddened by the curtains within; the flowers shone out with a
strange whiteness, the taller ones almost like spiritual shapes;
the burnished orange leaves glistened, the water rose high in
silvery spray, and fell back into the blackness of the basin made
more visible by one trembling, shimmering reflection; the dark
blue sky above seemed shut into a vault by the enclosing
buildings, and one solitary planet shone out in the lustrous
neighbourhood of the moon.&nbsp; So still, so solemn, so
cool!&nbsp; Honora felt it as repose, and pensively began to
admire&mdash;Owen chimed in with her.&nbsp; Feverish thoughts and
perturbations were always gladly soothed away in her
company.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be alone stood barely confessing the
beauty, and suppressing impatience at their making so much of it;
not yet knowing enough of care or passion to seek repose, and
much more absorbed in human than in any other form of nature.</p>
<p>The music was her first hope of deliverance from her namesake
in the sky; but, behold, her companions chose to prefer hearing
that grand instrumental piece softened by distance; and even
Madame Hedwig&rsquo;s quivering notes did not bring them
in.&nbsp; However, at the first sounds of the accompaniment to
the &lsquo;Three Fishers&rsquo; Wives,&rsquo; Owen pulled back
the curtain, and handed the two ladies back into the room, by a
window much <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>nearer to the orchestra than that by
which they had gone out, not far from where Edna Murrell had just
risen, her hands nervously clasped together, her colour rapidly
varying, and her eyes roaming about as though in quest of
something.&nbsp; Indeed, through all the music, the slight sounds
of the entrance at the window did not escape her, and at the
instant when she should have begun to sing, Ph&oelig;be felt
those black eyes levelled on herself with a look that startled
her; they were at once removed, the head turned away; there was
an attempt at the first words, but they died away on her lips;
there was a sudden whiteness, Lucilla and the German both tried
to reseat her; but with readier judgment Owen made two long
steps, gathered her up in his strong arms, and bore her through
the curtains and out at the open window like a mere infant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come, don&rsquo;t&mdash;it will only make
more fuss&mdash;nobody has seen.&nbsp; Go to Madame Hedwig; tell
her from me to go on to her next, and cover her retreat,&rsquo;
said Lucilla, as fast as the words would come, signing back
Honora, and hastily disappearing between the curtains.</p>
<p>There was a command in Lucilla&rsquo;s gestures which always
made obedience the first instinct even with Honora, and her
impulse to assist thus counteracted, she had time to recollect
that Lucy might be supposed to know best what to do with the
schoolmistress, and that to dispose of her among her
ladies&rsquo; maid friends was doubtless the kindest measure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must say I am glad,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;the poor
thing cannot be quite so much spoilt as they wished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The concert proceeded, and in the next pause Honor fell into
conversation with a pleasant lady who had brought one pair of
young daughters in the morning, and now was doing the same duty
by an elder pair.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was standing near the window when a touch on her
arm and a whispered &lsquo;Help! hush!&rsquo; made her look
round.&nbsp; Holding the curtain apart, so as to form the least
possible aperture, and with one finger on her lip, was
Lucy&rsquo;s face, the eyes brimming over with laughter, as she
pointed to her head&mdash;three of the hooks had set their barbs
deep into the crimson satin curtain, and held her a prisoner!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never forgive you if you betray
me,&rsquo; she whispered, drawing Ph&oelig;be by the arm behind
the curtain; &lsquo;I should expire on the spot to be found in
Absalom&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; All that little goose&rsquo;s
fault&mdash;I never reckoned on having to rush about this
way.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you do it?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t spare
scissors,&rsquo; and Lucilla produced a pair from under her
skirt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rashe and I always go provided.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is she?&mdash;where is she?&rsquo; asked
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; He
took her out to the fountain; she was quite like a dead
thing.&nbsp; Water wouldn&rsquo;t make her come to, and I ran for
some salts; I wouldn&rsquo;t call anybody, for it was too
romantic a condition to have Owen discovered in, with a fainting
maiden in his arms.&nbsp; Such a <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>rummage as
I had.&nbsp; My own things are all jumbled up, I don&rsquo;t know
how, and Rashe keeps nothing bigger than globules, only fit for
fainting lady-birds, so I went to Lolly&rsquo;s, but her bottles
have all gold heads, and are full of uncanny-looking compounds,
and I made a raid at last on Sweet Honey&rsquo;s rational old
dressing-case, poked out her keys from her pocket, and got in;
wasting interminable time.&nbsp; Well, when I got back to my
fainting damsel, <i>non est inventus</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Inventa</i>,&rsquo; murmured the spirit of Miss
Fennimore within Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what? had she got
well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I suppose.&nbsp; Gone off to the servants&rsquo;
rooms, no doubt; as there is no White Lady in the fountain to
spirit them both away.&nbsp; What, haven&rsquo;t you done that,
yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Lucy, stand still, please, or you&rsquo;ll get
another hook in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the scissors; I know I could do it
quicker.&nbsp; Never mind the curtain, I say; nobody will
care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put up her hand, and shook head and feet to the
entanglement of a third hook; but Ph&oelig;be, decided damsel
that she was, used her superior height to keep her mastery, held
up the scissors, pressed the fidgety shoulder into quiescence,
and kept her down while she extricated her, without fatal
detriment to the satin, though with scanty thanks, for the
liberation was no sooner accomplished than the sprite was off,
throwing out a word about Rashe wanting her.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be emerged to find that she had not been missed, and
presently the concert was over, and tea coming round, there was a
change of places.&nbsp; Robert came towards her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am going,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Robert, when dancing would be one
chance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does not mean to give me that chance; I would not
ask it while she is in that dress.&nbsp; It is answer
sufficient.&nbsp; Good night, Ph&oelig;be; enjoy
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Enjoy herself!&nbsp; A fine injunction, when her brother was
going away in such a mood!&nbsp; Yet who would have suspected
that rosy, honest apple face of any grievance, save that her
partner was missing?</p>
<p>Honora was vexed and concerned at his neglect, but Ph&oelig;be
appeased her by reporting what Lucy had said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thoughtless! reckless!&rsquo; sighed Honora; &lsquo;if
Lucy <i>would</i> leave the poor girl on his hands, of course he
is obliged to make some arrangement for getting her home!&nbsp; I
never knew such people as they are here!&nbsp; Well, Ph&oelig;be,
you <i>shall</i> have a partner next time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had one, thanks chiefly to Rashe, and somehow the
rapid motion shook her out of her troubles, and made her care
much less for Robin&rsquo;s sorrows than she had done two minutes
before.&nbsp; She was much more absorbed in hopes for another
partner.</p>
<p>Alas! he did not come; neither then nor for the ensuing.&nbsp;
Owen&rsquo;s value began to rise.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote did not again bestir herself in the cause,
partly from abstract hatred of waltzes, partly from the constant
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>expectation of Owen&rsquo;s reappearance, and latterly
from being occupied in a discussion with the excellent mother
upon young girls reading novels.</p>
<p>At last, after a <i>galoppe</i>, at which Ph&oelig;be had
looked on with wishful eyes, Lucilla dropped breathless into the
chair which she relinquished to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ph&oelig;be, how do you like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! very much,&rsquo; rather ruefully; &lsquo;at least
it would be if&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had any partners, eh, poor child?&nbsp;
Hasn&rsquo;t Owen turned up?</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s that billiard-room; I tried to make Charlie
shut it up.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll disinter him; I&rsquo;ll rush
in like a sky-rocket, and scatter the gentlemen to all
quarters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, alarmed,
and catching hold of her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not that, but Robin
is gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Atrocious,&rsquo; returned Cilly, disconcerted, but
resolved that Ph&oelig;be should not perceive it; &lsquo;so we
are both under a severe infliction,&mdash;both ashamed of our
brothers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not ashamed of mine,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, in a
tone of gravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s the truant,&rsquo; said Lucilla,
turning aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Owen, where have you hidden
yourself?&nbsp; I hope you are ready to sink into the earth with
shame at hearing you have rubbed off the bloom from a young
lady&rsquo;s first ball.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! it was not he who did so,&rsquo; stoutly replied
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! it was all the consequence of the green and white;
I told you it was a sinister omen,&rsquo; said Owen, chasing away
a shade of perplexity from his brow, and assuming a certain air
that Ph&oelig;be had never seen before, and did not like.&nbsp;
&lsquo;At least you will be merciful, and allow me to retrieve my
character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had nothing to retrieve,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
in the most straightforward manner; &lsquo;it was very good in
you to take care of poor Miss Murrell.&nbsp; What became of
her?&nbsp; Lucy said you would know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I?&rsquo; he exclaimed, so vehemently as to
startle her by the fear of having ignorantly committed some
egregious blunder; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the last person to
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last to be seen with the murdered always falls
under suspicion,&rsquo; said Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drowned in the fountain?&rsquo; cried Owen, affecting
horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you must have done it,&rsquo; said his sister,
&lsquo;for when I came back, after ransacking the house for
salts, you had both disappeared.&nbsp; Have you been washing your
hands all this time after the murder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing can clear me but an appeal to the
fountain,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;will you come and look in,
Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; It is more delicious than ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Ph&oelig;be had had enough of the moonlight, did not
relish the subject, and was not pleased with Owen&rsquo;s manner;
so she refused by a most decided &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo;
causing Lucy to laugh at her for thinking Owen dangerous.</p>
<p><!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&lsquo;At least you will vouchsafe to trust yourself
with me for the Lancers,&rsquo; said Owen, as Cilla&rsquo;s
partner came to claim her, and Ph&oelig;be rejoiced in anything
to change the tone of the conversation; still, however, asking,
as he led her off, what had become of the poor
schoolmistress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone home, very sensibly,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;if
she is wise she will know how to trust to Cilly&rsquo;s
invitations!&nbsp; People that do everything at once never do
anything well.&nbsp; It is quite a rest to turn to any one like
you, Ph&oelig;be, who are content with one thing at a time!&nbsp;
I wish&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, let us dance,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
abruptly; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do that well enough to talk
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not that Owen had not said the like things to her many
times before; it was his eagerness and fervour that gave her an
uncomfortable feeling.&nbsp; She was not sure that he was not
laughing at her by putting on these devoted airs, and she felt
herself grown up enough to put an end to being treated as a
child.&nbsp; He made her a profound bow in a mockery of
acquiescence, and preserved absolute silence during the first
figures, but she caught his eye several times gazing on her with
looks such as another might have interpreted into mingled regret
and admiration, but which were to her simply discomfiting and
disagreeable, and when he spoke again, it was not in banter, but
half in sadness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, how do you like all
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I could like it very much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost sorry to hear you say so; anything that
should tend to make you resemble others is detestable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be very sorry not to be like other
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, you do not know how much of the pleasure
of my life would be lost if you were to become a mere
conventional young lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had no notion of being the pleasure of any
one&rsquo;s life except Robin&rsquo;s and Maria&rsquo;s, and was
rather affronted that Owen should profess to enjoy her childish
ignorance and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I was rude just now
when I told you not to talk.&nbsp; I am sorry for it; I shall
know better next time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your knowing better is exactly what I deprecate.&nbsp;
But there it is; unconsciousness is the charm of
simplicity.&nbsp; It is the very thing aimed at by Rashe and
Cilly, and all their crew, with their eccentricities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for it,&rsquo; seriously returned
Ph&oelig;be, who had by this time, by quiet resistance, caused
him to land her under the lee of Miss Charlecote, instead of
promenading with her about the room.&nbsp; He wanted her to dance
with him again, saying she owed it to him for having sacrificed
the first to common humanity, but great as was the pleasure of a
polka, she shrank from him in this complimentary mood, and
declared she should dance no more that evening.&nbsp; He appealed
to Honora, who, disliking to have her boy balked of even a polka,
asked Ph&oelig;be if she were <i>very</i> tired, and considering
her &lsquo;rather not&rsquo; <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>as
equivalent to such a confession, proposed a retreat to their own
room.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was sorry to leave the brilliant scene, and no
longer to be able to watch Lucilla, but she wanted to shake Owen
off, and readily consented.&nbsp; She shut her door after one
good night.&nbsp; She was too much grieved and disappointed to
converse, and could not bear to discuss whether the last hope
were indeed gone, and whether Lucilla had decided her lot without
choosing to know it.&nbsp; Alas! how many turning-points may be
missed by those who never watch!</p>
<p>How little did Ph&oelig;be herself perceive the shoal past
which her self-respect had just safely guided her!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if those were ball-room manners?&nbsp; What a
pity if they were, for then I shall not like balls,&rsquo; was
all the thought that she had leisure to bestow on her own share
in the night&rsquo;s diversions, as through the subsequent hours
she dozed and dreamt, and mused and slept again, with the
feverish limbs and cramp-tormented feet of one new to balls;
sometimes teased by entangling fishing flies, sometimes
interminably detained in the moonlight, sometimes with Miss
Fennimore waiting for an exercise, and the words not to be found
in the dictionary; and even this unpleasant counterfeit of sleep
deserting her after her usual time for waking, and leaving her to
construct various fabrics of possibilities for Robin and
Lucy.</p>
<p>She was up in fair time, and had written a long and particular
account to Bertha of everything in the festivities not recorded
in this narrative, before Miss Charlecote awoke from the
compensating morning slumber that had succeeded a sad and
unrestful night.&nbsp; Late as they were, they were down-stairs
before any one but the well-seasoned Rashe, who sat beguiling the
time with a Bradshaw, and who did <i>not</i> tell them how
intolerably cross Cilly had been all the morning.</p>
<p>Nor would any one have suspected it who had seen her, last of
all, come down at a quarter to eleven, in the most exultant
spirits, talking the height of rodomontade with the gentlemen
guests, and dallying with her breakfast, while
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart was throbbing at the sight of two grave
figures, her brother and the curate, slowly marching up and down
the cloister, in waiting till this was over.</p>
<p>And there sat Lucilla inventing adventures for an imaginary
tour to be brought out on her return by the name of &lsquo;Girls
in Galway&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;From the Soir&eacute;e to the
Salmon&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Flirts and Fools-heads,&rsquo; as Owen
and Charles discontentedly muttered to each other, or, as Mr.
Calthorp proposed, &lsquo;The Angels and the
Anglers.&rsquo;&nbsp; The ball was to be the opening
chapter.&nbsp; Lord William entreated for her costume as the
frontispiece, and Mr. Calthorp begged her to re-assume it, and
let her cousin photograph her on the spot.</p>
<p>Lucilla objected to the impracticability of white silk, the
inconvenience of unpacking the apparatus, the nuisance of <!--
page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>dressing, the lack of time; but Rashe was delighted
with the idea, and made light of all, and the gentlemen pressed
her strongly, till with rather more of a consent than a refusal,
she rose from her nearly untasted breakfast, and began to move
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla,&rsquo; said Mr. Prendergast, at the window,
&lsquo;can I have a word with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At your service,&rsquo; she answered, as she came out
to him, and saw that Robert had left him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only be
quick; they want to photograph me in my ball-dress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t let them do it, though,&rsquo; said the
curate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;White comes out hideous,&rsquo; said Lucilla; &lsquo;I
suppose you would not have a copy, if I took one off for
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I don&rsquo;t like those visitors of yours well
enough to see you turned into a merry-andrew to please
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that&rsquo;s what Robert Fulmort told you I did last
night,&rsquo; said Lucilla, blushing at last, and thoroughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed; you didn&rsquo;t?&rsquo; he said, regarding
her with an astonished glance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>did</i> wear a dress trimmed with salmon-flies,
because of a bet with Lord William,&rsquo; said Lucilla, the
suffusion deepening on brow, cheek, and throat, as the confiding
esteem of her fatherly friend effected what nothing else could
accomplish.&nbsp; She would have given the world to have
justified his opinion of his late rector&rsquo;s little daughter,
and her spirits seemed gone, though the worst he did was to shake
his head at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you did not know it, why did you call me
<i>that</i>?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A merry-andrew?&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;I never
meant that you had been one.&nbsp; No; only an old friend like me
doesn&rsquo;t like the notion of your going and dressing up in
the morning to amuse a lot of scamps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Lucilla, very low.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; began Mr. Prendergast, as in haste
to proceed to his own subject; but she cut him short.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not about Ireland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I know nothing about young ladies; and if Mr.
Charteris and your excellent friend there have nothing to say
against it, I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My excellent friend had so much to say against it, that
I was pestered into vowing I would go!&nbsp; Tell me not, Mr.
Prendergast,&mdash;I should not mind giving up to you;&rsquo; and
she looked full of hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would be beginning at the wrong end, Cilla; you
are not my charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are my clergyman,&rsquo; she said, pettishly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not my parishioner,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pish!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;when you know I want you
to tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you say you have made the engagement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So what I said when she fretted me past endurance must
bind me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Be it observed that, like all who only knew Hiltonbury <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>through Lucilla, Mr. Prendergast attributed any
blemishes which he might detect in her to the injudicious
training of an old maid; so he sympathized.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!
ladies of a certain age never get on with young ones!&nbsp; But I
thought it was all settled before with Miss Charteris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never quite said I would go, only we got ready for
the sake of the fun of talking of it, and now Rashe has grown
horridly eager about it.&nbsp; She did not care at
first&mdash;only to please me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then wouldn&rsquo;t it be using her ill to disappoint
her now?&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t do it, Cilla.&nbsp; Why, you
have given your word, and she is quite old enough for
anything.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t Miss Charlecote see it
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To regard Ratia as a mature personage robbed the project of
romance, and to find herself bound in honour by her inconsiderate
rattle was one of the rude shocks which often occur to the
indiscriminate of tongue; but the curate had too much on his mind
to dwell on what concerned him more remotely, and proceeded,
&lsquo;I came to see whether you could help me about poor Miss
Murrell.&nbsp; You made no arrangement for her getting home last
night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you young people!&nbsp; But it is my fault; I
should have recollected young heads.&nbsp; Then I am afraid it
must have been&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was seen on the river very late last night with a
stranger.&nbsp; He went up to the school with her, remained about
a quarter of an hour, and then rowed up the river again.&nbsp; I
am afraid it is not the first time she has been seen with
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Prendergast, she was here till at least
ten!&nbsp; She fainted away just as she was to have sung, and we
carried her out into the cloister.&nbsp; When she recovered she
went away to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room&mdash;&rsquo; (a bold
assertion, built on Owen&rsquo;s partially heard reply to
Ph&oelig;be).&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the maids.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of no use, Cilla; she allows it
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray,&rsquo; cried Lucilla, rallying her sauciness,
&lsquo;how do you propose ever to have banns to publish, if young
men and maidens are never to meet by water nor by
land?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you do know something?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; only that such matters are not commonly blazoned in
the commencement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish her to blazon it, but if she would
only act openly by me,&rsquo; said the distressed curate.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wish nothing more than that she was safe married; and
then if you ladies appoint another beauty, I&rsquo;ll give up the
place, and live at --- college.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll advertise for the female Chimpanzee, and
depend upon it she will marry at the end of six weeks.&nbsp; So
you have attacked her in person.&nbsp; What did she
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing that she could help.&nbsp; She stood with those
great <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>eyes cast down, looking like a
statue, and sometimes vouchsafing &ldquo;yes, sir,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was &ldquo;no, sir,&rdquo; when I
asked if her mother knew.&nbsp; I am afraid it must be something
very unsatisfactory, Cilla; but she might say more to you if you
were not going away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Mr. Prendergast, why did you not come
sooner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did come an hour ago, but you were not come
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll walk on at once; the carriage can pick me
up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fetch my hat.&nbsp; Poor Edna!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll soon make her satisfy your mind.&nbsp; Has any one
surmised who it can be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The notion is that it is one of your
musicians&mdash;very dangerous, I am afraid; and I say, Cilla,
did you ever do such a thing&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t, I
suppose&mdash;as lend her Shelley&rsquo;s poems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I?&nbsp; No; certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a copy lying on the table in her little
parlour, as if she had been writing something out from it.&nbsp;
It is very odd, but it was in that peculiar olive-green morocco
that some of the books in your father&rsquo;s library were bound
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not mine, certainly,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good Honor Charlecote would have run crazy if she thought
I had touched a Shelley; a very odd study for Edna.&nbsp; But as
to the olive-green, of course it was bound under the same star as
ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilly, Cilly, now or never! photograph or not?&rsquo;
screamed Rashe, from behind her three-legged camera.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not!&rsquo; was Lucilla&rsquo;s cavalier answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pack up; have done with it, Rashe.&nbsp; Pick me up at the
school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away she flew headlong, the patient and disconcerted Horatia
following her to her room to extract hurried explanations, and
worse than no answers as to the sundries to be packed at the last
moment, while she hastily put on hat and mantle, and was flying
down again, when her brother, with outspread arms, nearly caught
her in her spring.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hollo! what&rsquo;s
up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stop me, Owen!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to
walk on with Mr. Prendergast and be picked up.&nbsp; I must speak
to Edna Murrell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; The carriage will be out in five
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go, Owen.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some story of a
demon in human shape on the water with her last night, and Mr.
Prendergast can&rsquo;t get a word out of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that any reason you should go ramping about, prying
into people&rsquo;s affairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Owen, they will send her away.&nbsp; They will
take away her character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;the more reason you should have
nothing to do with it,&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is no
business for you, and I won&rsquo;t have you meddle in
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a strong and sudden assumption of fraternal authority
took away her breath; and then, in terror lest he should know
cause for this detention, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen! you don&rsquo;t guess who it was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How should I?&rsquo; he roughly answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Some villainous <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>slander, of
course, there is, but it is no business of yours to be straking
off to make it worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not make it worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Women always make things worse.&nbsp; Are you satisfied
now?&rsquo; as the carriage was seen coming round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is only to be packed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Packed with folly, yes!&nbsp; Look here!&nbsp; 11.20,
and the train at 12.5!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will miss the train, go up later, and sleep in
London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff and nonsense!&nbsp; Who is going to take
you?&nbsp; Not I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Lucilla&rsquo;s desperation in the cause of her favourite
Edna, she went through a rapid self-debate.&nbsp; Honor would
gladly wait for her for such a cause; she could sleep at
Woolstone-lane, and thence go on to join Horatia in Derbyshire,
escorted by a Hiltonbury servant.&nbsp; But what would that
entail?&nbsp; She would be at their mercy.&nbsp; Robert would
obtain his advantage&mdash;it would be all over with her!&nbsp;
Pride arose; Edna&rsquo;s cause sank.&nbsp; How many destinies
were fixed in the few seconds while she stood with one foot
forward, spinning her black hat by the elastic band!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too late, Mr. Prendergast; I cannot go,&rsquo; she
said, as she saw him waiting for her at the door.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, and don&rsquo;t let the
womankind prejudice you against poor Edna.&nbsp; You forgive
me!&nbsp; It is really too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive <i>you</i>?&rsquo; smiled Mr. Prendergast,
pressing her caressing hand in his great, lank grasp; &lsquo;what
for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, because it is too late; and I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be hard with her.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Too late!&nbsp; Why did Lucilla repeat those words so
often?&nbsp; Was it a relief to that irreflective nature to
believe the die irrevocably cast, and the responsibility of
decision over?&nbsp; Or why did she ask forgiveness of the only
one whom she was not offending, but because there was a sense of
need of pardon where she would not stoop to ask it.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote and the Fulmorts, Rashe and Cilly, were to be
transported to London by the same train, leaving Owen behind to
help Charles Charteris entertain some guests still remaining,
Honora promising him to wait in town until Lucilla should
absolutely have started for Ireland, when she would supply him
with the means of pursuit.</p>
<p>Lucilla&rsquo;s delay and change of mind made the final
departure so late that it was needful to drive excessively fast,
and the train was barely caught in time.&nbsp; The party were
obliged to separate, and Robert took Ph&oelig;be into a different
carriage from that where the other three found places.</p>
<p>In the ten minutes&rsquo; transit by railway, Lucy, always
softened by parting, was like another being towards Honor, and
talked eagerly of &lsquo;coming home&rsquo; for Christmas, sent
messages to Hiltonbury friends, and did everything short of
retractation to efface the painful impression she had left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sweetest Honey!&rsquo; she whispered, as they moved on
after <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the tickets had been taken,
thrusting her pretty head over into Honor&rsquo;s place.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nobody&rsquo;s looking, give me a kiss, and say you
don&rsquo;t bear malice, though your kitten has been in a
scratching humour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Malice! no indeed!&rsquo; said Honor, fondly;
&lsquo;but, oh! remember, dear child, that frolics may be at too
dear a price.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She longed to say more, but the final stop was made, and their
roads diverged.&nbsp; Honor thought that Lucy looked white and
trembling, with an uneasy eye, as though she would have given
much to have been going home with her.</p>
<p>Nor was the consoling fancy unfounded.&nbsp; Lucilla&rsquo;s
nerves were not at their usual pitch, and an undefined sense of
loss of a safeguard was coming over her.&nbsp; Moreover, the
desire for a last word to Robert was growing every moment, and he
<i>would</i> keep on hunting out those boxes, as if they mattered
to anybody.</p>
<p>She turned round on his substitute, and said,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not spoken to Robin all this time.&nbsp; No
wonder his feathers are ruffled.&nbsp; Make my peace with him,
Ph&oelig;be dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the very platform, in that moment of bustle, Ph&oelig;be
conscientiously and reasonably began, &lsquo;Will you tell me how
much you mean by that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilly&mdash;King&rsquo;s-cross&mdash;1.15,&rsquo; cried
Ratia, snatching at her arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! the slave one is!&nbsp; Next time we meet,
Ph&oelig;be, the redbreast will be in a white tie, I
shall&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hurry and agitation were making her flippant, and Robert was
nearer than she deemed.&nbsp; He was assisting her to her seat,
and then held out his hand, but never raised his eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Goodbye, Robin,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;Reason herself
shall meet you at the Holt at Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; he said, but without a word of augury,
and loosed her hand.&nbsp; Her fingers clung one moment, but he
drew his away, called &lsquo;King&rsquo;s-cross&rsquo; to the
coachman, and she was whirled off.&nbsp; Angler as she was, she
no longer felt her prey answer her pull.&nbsp; Had the line
snapped?</p>
<p>When Owen next appeared in Woolstone-lane he looked fagged and
harassed, but talked of all things in sky, earth, or air,
politics, literature, or gossip, took the bottom of the table,
and treated the Parsonses as his guests.&nbsp; Honora, however,
felt that something was amiss; perhaps Lucilla engaged to Lord
William; and when, after luncheon, he followed her to the cedar
room, she began with a desponding &lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she is off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alone with Rashe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alone with Rashe.&nbsp; Why, Sweet Honey, you look
gratified!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had begun to fear some fresh news,&rsquo; said Honor,
smiling with effort.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure that something is
wrong.&nbsp; You do not look well, my dear.&nbsp; How flushed you
are, and your forehead is so hot!&rsquo; as she put her hand on
his brow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing!&rsquo; he said, caressingly, holding it
there.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>glad to
have got away from the castle; Charlie and his set drink an
intolerable lot of wine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be there again in a
hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad of that.&nbsp; I wish you had come away with
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to heaven I had!&rsquo; cried Owen; &lsquo;but
it could not be helped!&nbsp; So now for my wild-goose
chase.&nbsp; Cross to-morrow night; only you were good enough to
say you would find ways and means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, that is what I intended, including your
Midsummer quarter.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it enough?&rsquo;
as she detected a look of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very good.&nbsp; It is a tremendous shame; but
you see, Honor dear, when one is across the water, one may as
well go the whole animal.&nbsp; If this wise sister of mine does
not get into a mess, there is a good deal I could do&mdash;plenty
of sport.&nbsp; Little Henniker and some Westminster fellows in
the ---th are at Kilkenny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would like to spend the vacation in Ireland,&rsquo;
said Honor, with some disappointment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, if you
go for my pleasure, it is but fair you should have your
own.&nbsp; Shall I advance your September allowance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; You do spoil one abominably, you
concoction of honey and all things sweet.&nbsp; But the fact is,
I&rsquo;ve got uncommonly hard-up of late; no one would believe
how ruinous it is being with the Charterises.&nbsp; I believe
money evaporates in the atmosphere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Betting?&rsquo; asked Honor, gasping and aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On my honour, I assure you not <i>there</i>,&rsquo;
cried Owen, eagerly, &lsquo;I never did bet there but once, and
that was Lolly&rsquo;s doing; and I could not get out of
it.&nbsp; Jew that she is!&nbsp; I wonder what Uncle Kit would
say to that house now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are out of it, and I shall not regret the purchase
of your disgust at their ways, Owen.&nbsp; It may be better for
you to be in Ireland than to be tempted to go to them for the
shooting season.&nbsp; How much do you want?&nbsp; You know, my
dear, if there be anything else, I had rather pay anything that
is right than have you in debt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were always the sweetest, best Honey living!&rsquo;
cried Owen, with much agitation; &lsquo;and it is a
shame&mdash;&rsquo; but there he stopped, and ended in a more
ordinary tone&mdash;&lsquo;shame to prey on you, as we both do,
and with no better return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, dear Owen,&rsquo; she said, with moisture
in her eye; &lsquo;your real happiness is the only return I
want.&nbsp; Come, tell me your difficulty; most likely I can help
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to tell,&rsquo; said Owen, with
alarmed impetuosity; &lsquo;only that I&rsquo;m a fool, like
every one else, and&mdash;and&mdash;if you would only double
that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Double that!&nbsp; Owen, things cannot be
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you they were not right,&rsquo; was the
impatient answer, &lsquo;or I should not be vexing you and
myself; and,&rsquo; as though to <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>smooth away
his rough commencement, &lsquo;what a comfort to have a Honey
that will have patience!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, perplexed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Owen, I wish you
could tell me more.&nbsp; I do not like debts.&nbsp; You know,
dear boy, I grudge nothing I can do for you in my lifetime; but
for your own sake you must learn not to spend more than you will
be able to afford.&nbsp; Indulgence now will be a penance to you
by and by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora dreaded overdoing lectures to Owen.&nbsp; She knew that
an old maid&rsquo;s advice to a young man was dangerous work, and
her boy&rsquo;s submissive patience always excited her gratitude
and forbearance, so she desisted, in hopes of a confession,
looking at him with such tenderness that he was moved to
exclaim&mdash;&lsquo;Honor dear, you are the best and worst-used
woman on earth!&nbsp; Would to heaven that we had requited you
better!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no cause of complaint against you, Owen,&rsquo;
she said, fondly; &lsquo;you have always been the joy and comfort
of my heart;&rsquo; and as he turned aside, as though stricken by
the words, &lsquo;whatever you may have to reproach yourself
with, it is not with hurting me; I only wish to remind you of
higher and more stringent duties than those to myself.&nbsp; If
you have erred, as I cannot but fear, will you not let me try and
smooth the way back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible,&rsquo; murmured Owen; &lsquo;there are
things that can never be undone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not undone, but repented,&rsquo; said Honor, convinced
that he had been led astray by his cousin Charles, and felt bound
not to expose him; &lsquo;so repented as to become
stepping-stones in our progress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He only shook his head with a groan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more sorrow, the better hope,&rsquo; she began; but
the impatient movement of his foot warned her that she was only
torturing him, and she proceeded,&mdash;&lsquo;Well, I trust you
implicitly; I can understand that there may be confidences that
ought not to pass between us, and will give you what you require
to help you out of your difficulty.&nbsp; I wish you had a
father, or any one who could be of more use to you, my poor
boy!&rsquo; and she began to fill up the cheque to the utmost of
his demand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too much&mdash;too much,&rsquo; cried Owen.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Honor, I must tell you at all costs.&nbsp; What will you
think when&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wish to purchase a confession, Owen,&rsquo;
she said; &lsquo;you know best whether it be a fit one to make to
me, or whether for the sake of others you ought to withhold
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was checked, and did not answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see how it is,&rsquo; continued Honor; &lsquo;my boy,
as far as I am concerned, I look on your confession as
made.&nbsp; You will be much alone while thus hovering near your
sister among the mountains and by the streams.&nbsp; Let it be a
time of reflection, and of making your peace with Another.&nbsp;
You may do so the more earnestly for not having cast off the
burthen on me.&nbsp; You are no child now, to whom your poor
Honey&rsquo;s pardon almost <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>seems an
absolution.&nbsp; I sometimes think we went on with that too
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No fear of my ever being a boy again,&rsquo; said Owen,
heavily, as he put the draft into his purse, and then bent his
tall person to kiss her with the caressing fondness of his
childhood, almost compensating for what his sister caused her to
undergo.</p>
<p>Then, at the door, he turned to say, &lsquo;Remember, you
would not hear.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was gone, having left a thorn
with Honor, in the doubt whether she ought not to have accepted
his confidence; but her abstinence had been such a mortification
both of curiosity and of hostility to the Charterises that she
could not but commend herself for it.&nbsp; She had strong faith
in the efficacy of trust upon an honourable mind, and though it
was evident that Owen had, in his own eyes, greatly transgressed,
she reserved the hope that his error was magnified by his own
consciousness, and admired the generosity that refused to betray
another.&nbsp; She believed his present suffering to be the
beginning of that growth in true religion which is often founded
on some shock leading to self-distrust.</p>
<p>Alas! how many falls have been counted by mothers as the
preludes to rising again, like the clearing showers of a stormy
day.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<blockquote><p>Fearless she had tracked his feet<br />
To this rocky, wild retreat,<br />
And when morning met his view,<br />
Her mild glances met it too.<br />
Ah! your saints have cruel hearts,<br />
Sternly from his bed he starts,<br />
And with rude, repulsive shock,<br />
Hurls her from the beetling rock.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.
Moore</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deed was done.&nbsp; Conventionalities were defied, vaunts
fulfilled, and Lucilla sat on a camp-stool on the deck of a
steamer, watching the Welsh mountains rise, grow dim, and vanish
gradually.</p>
<p>Horatia, in common with all the rest of the womankind, was
prostrate on the cabin floor, treating Cilly&rsquo;s smiles and
roses as aggravations of her misery.&nbsp; Had there been a
sharer in her exultation, the gay pitching and dancing of the
steamer would have been charming to Lucy, but when she retreated
from the scene of wretchedness below, she felt herself lonely,
and was conscious of some surprise among the surviving gentlemen
at her reappearance.</p>
<p>She took out a book as a protection, and read more
continuously than she had done since <i>Vanity Fair</i> had come
to the Holt, and she had been pleased to mark Honora&rsquo;s
annoyance at every page she turned.</p>
<p>But the July light faded, and only left her the poor amusement
of looking over the side for the phosphorescence of the water,
and watching the smoke of the funnel lose itself overhead.&nbsp;
The <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>silent stars and sparkling waves
would have set Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s dutiful science on the alert,
or transported Honor&rsquo;s inward ear by the chant of creation,
but to her they were of moderate interest, and her imagination
fell a prey to the memory of the eyes averted, and hand
withdrawn.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be exemplary when this is
over,&rsquo; said she to herself, and at length her head nodded
till she dropped into a giddy doze, whence with a chilly start
she awoke, as the monotonous jog and bounce of the steamer were
exchanged for a snort of arrival, among mysterious lanes of
sparkling lights apparently rising from the waters.</p>
<p>She had slept just long enough to lose the lovely entrance of
Dublin Bay, stiffen her limbs, and confuse her brains, and she
stood still as the stream of passengers began to rush trampling
by her, feeling bewildered and forlorn.&nbsp; Her cousin&rsquo;s
voice was welcome, though over-loud and somewhat piteous.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where are you, stewardess? where&rsquo;s the young
lady?&nbsp; Oh! Cilly, there you are.&nbsp; To leave me alone all
this time, and here&rsquo;s the stewardess saying we must go
ashore at once, or lose the train.&nbsp; Oh! the luggage, and
I&rsquo;ve lost my plaid,&rsquo; and ghastly in the lamplight,
limp and tottering, Rashe Charteris clasped her arm for support,
and made her feel doubly savage and bewildered.&nbsp; Her first
movement was to enjoin silence, then to gaze about for the
goods.&nbsp; A gentleman took pity on the two ladies, and told
them not to be deluded into trying to catch the train; there
would be another in an hour&rsquo;s time, and if they had any one
to meet them, they would most easily be found where they
were.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have no one&mdash;we are alone,&rsquo; said Lucilla;
and his chivalry was so far awakened that he handed them to the
pier, and undertook to find their boxes.&nbsp; Rashe was
absolutely subdued, and hung shivering and helpless on her
cousin, who felt as though dreaming in the strange scene of
darkness made visible by the bright circles round the lamps,
across which rapidly flitted the cloaked forms of travellers
presiding over queer, wild, caricature-like shapes, each bending
low under the weight of trunk or bag, in a procession like a
magic lantern, save for the Babel of shrieks, cries, and
expostulations everywhere in light or gloom.</p>
<p>A bell rang, an engine roared and rattled off.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The train!&rsquo; sighed Horatia; &lsquo;we shall have to
stay here all night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Lucy, ready to shake her;
&lsquo;there is another in an hour.&nbsp; Stay quiet, do, or he
will never find us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Porter, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;porrterr&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, thank you,&rsquo; cried Lucilla, darting on her
rod-case and carriage-bag to rescue them from a freckled
countenance with claws attached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall lose everything, Cilla; that&rsquo;s your
trusting to a stranger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right; thank you!&rsquo; as she recognized her
possessions, borne on various backs towards the station, whither
the traveller escorted them, and where things looked more
civilized.&nbsp; Ratia <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>began to
resume her senses, though weak and hungry.&nbsp; She was sorely
discomfited at having to wait, and could not, like the seasoned
voyagers, settle herself to repose on the long leathern couches
of the waiting-room, but wandered, woebegone and impatient,
scolding her cousin for choosing such an hour for their passage,
for her desertion and general bad management.&nbsp; The merry,
good-natured Rashe had disappeared in the sea-sick, cross, and
weary wight, whose sole solace was grumbling, but her dolefulness
only made Lucilla more mirthful.&nbsp; Here they were, and happen
what would, it should only be &lsquo;such fun.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Recovered from the moment&rsquo;s bewilderment, Lucy announced
that she felt as if she were at a ball, and whispered a proposal
of astonishing the natives by a polka in the great empty boarded
space.&nbsp; &lsquo;The suggestion would immortalize us;
come!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she threatened mischievously to seize the
waist of the still giddy and aching-headed Horatia, who repulsed
her with sufficient roughness and alarm to set her off laughing
at having been supposed to be in earnest.</p>
<p>The hurry of the train came at last; they hastened down-stairs
and found the train awaiting them, were told their luggage was
safe, and after sitting till they were tired, shot onwards
watching the beautiful glimpses of the lights in the ships off
Kingstown.&nbsp; They would gladly have gone on all night without
another disembarkation and scramble, but the Dublin station came
only too soon; they were disgorged, and hastened after
goods.&nbsp; Forth came trunk and portmanteau.&nbsp; Alas! none
of theirs!&nbsp; Nothing with them but two carriage-bags and two
rod-cases!</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to be a common predicament,&rsquo; said
Lucilla; &lsquo;here are at least half-a-dozen in the same
case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Horrible management.&nbsp; We shall never see it
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, take comfort in the general lot.&nbsp; It will
turn up to-morrow; and meantime sleep is not packed up in our
boxes.&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s be off.&nbsp; What noises!&nbsp;
How do these drivers keep from running over one another.&nbsp;
Each seems ready to whip every one&rsquo;s beast but his
own.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you feel yourself in Ireland, Rashe?&nbsp;
Arrah!&nbsp; I shall begin to scream too if I stand here much
longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go in that thing&mdash;a fly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t exist here, Rashe&mdash;vermin is
unknown.&nbsp; Submit to your fate&mdash;&rsquo; and ere another
objection could be uttered, Cilly threw bags and rods into an
inside car, and pushed her cousin after them, chattering all the
time, to poor Horatia&rsquo;s distraction.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!
delicious!&nbsp; A cross between a baker&rsquo;s cart and a Van
Amburgh.&nbsp; A little more and it would overbalance and carry
the horse head over heels!&nbsp; Take care, Rashe; you&rsquo;ll
pound me into dust if you slip down over me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!&nbsp; Oh! the vilest thing in
creation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such fun!&nbsp; To be taken when well shaken.&nbsp;
Here we go up, up, up; and here we go down, down, down!&nbsp; Ha!
ware <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>fishing-rod!&nbsp; This is what it
is to travel.&nbsp; No one ever described the experiences of an
inside car!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because no one in their senses would undergo such
misery!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t regard the beauties, Rashe,
beauties of nature and art combined&mdash;see the lights
reflected in the river&mdash;what a width.&nbsp; Oh! why
don&rsquo;t they treat the Thames as they do the
Liffey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see, I shall soon be dead! and getting to
an inn without luggage, it&rsquo;s not respectable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you depart this life on the way, the want of luggage
will concern me the most, my dear.&nbsp; Depend on it, other
people have driven up in inside cars, minus luggage, in the
memory of man, in this City of Dublin.&nbsp; Are you such a
worldling base as to depend for your respectability on a paltry
leathern trunk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla&rsquo;s confidence did not appear misplaced, for
neither waiters nor chambermaids seemed surprised, but assured
them that people usually missed their luggage by that train, and
asseverated that it would appear next morning.</p>
<p>Lucilla awoke determined to be full of frolic and enjoyment,
and Horatia, refreshed by her night&rsquo;s rest, was more easily
able to detect &lsquo;such fun&rsquo; than on the previous night;
so the two cousins sat down amicably to breakfast on the Sunday
morning, and inquired about church-services.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mallard&rsquo;s tail hat is odd &ldquo;go to
meeting&rdquo; head-gear,&rsquo; said Cilla, &lsquo;but one
cannot lapse into heathenism; so where, Rashe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to look into a Roman Catholic
affair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Cilly, decidedly; &lsquo;where I go it
shall be the genuine article.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like
curiosities in religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a curiosity to go to church at twelve
o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp; If you are so orthodox, let us wait for St.
Patrick&rsquo;s this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in the meantime?&nbsp; It is but eleven this
minute, and St. Patrick&rsquo;s is not till three.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nothing to be done but to watch Irish nature in the
street.&nbsp; Oh! I never before knew the perfection of
Carleton&rsquo;s illustration.&nbsp; See that woman and her cap,
and the man&rsquo;s round eyebrows and projecting lips with
shillelagh written on them.&nbsp; Would it be Sabbath-breaking to
perpetrate a sketch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But as Ratia was advancing to the window, Lucy suddenly
started back, seized her and whirled her away, crying, &lsquo;The
wretch!&nbsp; I know him now!&nbsp; I could not make him out last
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; exclaimed Rashe, starting determinedly to
the window, but detained by the two small but resolute hands
clasped round her waist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That black-whiskered valet of Mr.
Calthorp&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If that man has the insolence to dog me
and spy me, I&rsquo;ll not stay in Ireland another
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what fun!&rsquo; burst out Horatia.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
becomes romantic!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Atrocious impertinence!&rsquo; said Lucilla,
passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you stand there
laughing?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&lsquo;At you, my dear,&rsquo; gasped Ratia, sinking on
the sofa in her spasm of mirth.&nbsp; &lsquo;At your reception of
chivalrous devotion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty chivalry to come and spy and beset ladies
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has not beset us yet.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t flatter
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that, Horatia?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you want to try your pistols on me?&nbsp; The waiter
could show us the way to the Fifteen Acres, only you see it is
Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want,&rsquo; said Lucy, all tragedy and no comedy,
&lsquo;to know why you talk of my <i>flattering</i> myself that I
am insulted, and my plans upset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said Rashe, a little sneeringly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, a little professed beauty like you would be so
disappointed not to be pursued, that she is obliged to be always
seeing phantoms that give her no peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; coolly returned Cilly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll say no more about it, but if I find
that man to be in Ireland, the same day I go home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Horatia gave a loud, long, provoking laugh.&nbsp; Lucilla felt
it was for her dignity to let the subject drop, and betook
herself to the only volumes attainable, Bradshaw and her book of
flies; while Miss Charteris repaired to the window to investigate
for herself the question of the pursuer, and made enlivening
remarks on the two congregations, the one returning from mass,
the other going to church, but these were not appreciated.&nbsp;
It seemed as though the young ladies had but one set of spirits
between them, which were gained by the one as soon as lost by the
other.</p>
<p>It was rather a dull day.&nbsp; Fast as they were, the two
girls shrank from rambling alone in streets thronged with figures
that they associated with ruffianly destitution.&nbsp; Sunday had
brought all to light, and the large handsome streets were beset
with barefooted children, elf-locked women, and lounging,
beetle-browed men, such as Lucy had only seen in the purlieus of
Whittingtonia, in alleys looked into, but never entered by the
civilized.&nbsp; In reality &lsquo;rich and rare&rsquo; was so
true that they might have walked there more secure from insult
than in many better regulated regions, but it was difficult to
believe so, especially in attire then so novel as to be very
remarkable, and the absence of protection lost its charm when
there was no one to admire the bravado.</p>
<p>She did her best to embalm it for future appreciation by
journalizing, making the voyage out a far better joke than she
had found it, and describing the inside car in the true style of
the facetious traveller.&nbsp; Nothing so drives away fun as the
desire to be funny, and she began to grow weary of her work, and
disgusted at her own lumbering attempts at pen-and-ink mirth; but
they sufficed to make Rashe laugh, they would be quite good
enough for Lord William, would grievously annoy Honora
Charlecote, would be mentioned in all the periodicals, and give
them the name of the Angel Anglers all the next <!-- page
200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>season.&nbsp; Was not that enough to go to Ireland and
write a witty tour for?</p>
<p>The outside car took them to St. Patrick&rsquo;s, and they had
their first real enjoyment in the lazy liveliness of the vehicle,
and the droll ciceroneship of the driver, who contrived to convey
such compliments to their pretty faces as only an Irishman could
have given without offence.</p>
<p>Lucilla sprang down with exhilarated spirits, and even wished
for Honor to share her indignation at the slovenliness around the
cathedral, and the absence of close or cloister; nay, though she
had taken an aversion to Strafford as a hero of Honor&rsquo;s,
she forgave him, and resolved to belabour the House of Cork
handsomely in her journal, when she beheld the six-storied
monument, and imagined it, as he had found it, in the
Altar&rsquo;s very place.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would that he had created
an absolute Boylean vacuum!&rsquo;&nbsp; What a grand <i>bon
mot</i> for her journal!</p>
<p>However, either the spirit of indignation at the sight of the
unkneeling congregation, or else the familiar words of the
beautiful musical service, made her more than usually devout, and
stirred up something within her that could only be appeased by
the resolution that the singing in Robert Fulmort&rsquo;s parish
should be super-excellent.&nbsp; After the service, the carman
persuaded them to drive in the Ph&oelig;nix Park, where they
enjoyed the beautiful broken ground, the picturesque thickets,
the grass whose colour reminded them that they were in the
Emerald Isle, the purple outlines of the Wicklow hills, whence
they thought they detected a fresh mountain breeze.&nbsp; They
only wondered to find this delightful place so little
frequented.&nbsp; In England, a Sunday would have filled it with
holiday strollers, whereas here they only encountered a very few,
and those chiefly gentlefolks.&nbsp; The populace preferred
sitting on the doorsteps, or lounging against the houses, as if
they were making studies of themselves for caricatures; and were
evidently so much struck with the young ladies&rsquo; attire,
that the shelter of the hotel was gladly welcomed.</p>
<p>Lucilla was alone in the sitting-room when the waiter came to
lay the cloth.&nbsp; He looked round, as if to secure secrecy,
and then remarked in a low confidential voice,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s been a gentleman inquiring for you,
ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was it?&rsquo; said Lucy, with feigned
coolness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was when you were at church, ma&rsquo;am; he wished
to know whether two ladies had arrived here, Miss Charteris and
Miss Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he leave his card?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did not, ma&rsquo;am, his call was to be a secret;
he said it was only to be sure whether you had
arrived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he did not give his name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did, ma&rsquo;am, for he desired to be let know what
route the young ladies took when they left,&rsquo; quoth the man,
with a comical look, as though he were imparting a most
delightful secret.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&lsquo;Was he Mr. Calthorp?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said I&rsquo;d not mention his name,&rsquo; said the
waiter, with, however, such decided assent, that, as at the same
moment he quitted the room and Horatia entered it, Cilly
exclaimed, &lsquo;There, Rashe, what do you say now to the
phantom of my vanity?&nbsp; Here has he been asking for us, and
what route we meant taking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He!&nbsp; Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&mdash;why, who should it be?&nbsp; The waiter has
just told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You absurd girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ask him yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So when the waiter came up, Miss Charteris demanded,
&lsquo;Has Mr. Calthorp been calling here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was the name, ma&rsquo;am, if you
please?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Calthorp.&nbsp; Has Mr. Calthorp been calling
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cawthorne?&nbsp; Was it Colonel Cawthorne, of the Royal
Hussars, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; He was here yesterday, but not
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said Calthorp.&nbsp; Has a Mr. Calthorp been
inquiring for us to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not heard, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ll
inquire,&rsquo; said he, looking alert, and again disappearing,
while Horatia looked as proud of herself as Cilly had done just
before.</p>
<p>He came back again while Lucilla was repeating his
communication, and assured Miss Charteris that no such person had
called.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, what gentleman has been here, making inquiries
about us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gentleman!&nbsp; Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t
understand your meaning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you not been telling this young lady that a
gentleman has been asking after us, and desiring to be informed
what route we intended to take?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, sure!&rsquo; said the waiter, as if recollecting
himself, &lsquo;I did mention it.&nbsp; Some gentleman did just
ask me in a careless sort of way who the two beautiful young
ladies might be, and where they were going.&nbsp; Such young
ladies always create a sensation, as you must be aware,
ma&rsquo;am, and I own I did speak of it to the young lady,
because I thought she had seen the attraction of the
gentleman&rsquo;s eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So perfectly assured did he look, that Lucilla felt a
moment&rsquo;s doubt whether her memory served her as to his
former words, but just as she raised her eyes and opened her lips
in refutation, she met a glance from him full of ludicrous
reassurance, evidently meaning that he was guarding his own
secret and hers.&nbsp; He was gone the next moment, and Horatia
turned upon her with exultant merriment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always heard that Ireland was a mendacious
country,&rsquo; said Cilly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a country where people lose the use of their eyes
and <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>ears,&rsquo; laughed Rashe.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O what a foundation for the second act of the
drama!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of which the third will be my going home by the next
steamer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because a stranger asked who we were?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each had her own interpretation of the double-faced
waiter&rsquo;s assertion, and it served them to dispute upon all
the evening.</p>
<p>Lucilla was persuaded that he imagined her an injured beauty,
reft from her faithful adorer by her stern aunt or duenna, and
that he considered himself to be doing her a kindness by keeping
her informed of her hero&rsquo;s vicinity, while he denied it to
her companion; but she scorned to enter into an explanation, or
make any disavowal, and found the few displeased words she spoke
were received with compassion, as at the dictation of the stern
monitress.</p>
<p>Horatia, on the other hand, could not easily resign the
comical version that Lucilla&rsquo;s inordinate opinion of her
own attractions had made her imagine Mr. Calthorp&rsquo;s valet
in the street, and discover his master in the chance inquirer
whom the waiter had mentioned; and as Cilly could not aver that
the man had actually told her in so many words that it was Mr.
Calthorp, Horatia had a right to her opinion, and though she knew
she had been a young lady a good many years, she could not easily
adopt the suggestion that she could pass for Cilly&rsquo;s cruel
duenna.</p>
<p>Lucilla grew sullen, and talked of going home by the next
steamer; Rashe, far from ready for another sea voyage, called
herself ill used, and represented the absurdity of returning on a
false alarm.&nbsp; Cilla was staggered, and thought what it would
be, if Mr. Calthorp, smoking his cigar at his club, heard that
she had fled from his imaginary pursuit.&nbsp; Besides, the
luggage must be recovered, so she let Horatia go on arranging for
an excursion for the Monday, only observing that it must not be
in Dublin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, bonnets are needful there.&nbsp; What do you think
of Howth and Ireland&rsquo;s Eye, the place where Kirwan murdered
his wife?&rsquo; said Rashe, with great gusto, for she had a
strong turn for the horrid murders in the newspaper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too near, and too smart,&rsquo; sulked Lucy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then, Glendalough, that is wild, and far off
enough, and may be done in a day from Dublin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
ring and find out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not from that man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! we shall see Calthorps peopling the
hill-sides!&nbsp; Well, let us have the landlord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was found that both the Devil&rsquo;s Glen and the Seven
Churches might be visited if they started by the seven
o&rsquo;clock train, and returned late at night, and Lucilla
agreeing, the evening went off as best it might, the cousins
being glad to get out of each other&rsquo;s company at nine, that
they might be up <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>early the next morning.&nbsp; Lucy
had not liked Ratia so little since the days of her infantine
tyranny.</p>
<p>The morning, however, raised their spirits, and sent them off
in a more friendly humour, enjoying the bustle and excitement
that was meat and drink to them, and exclaiming at the exquisite
views of sea and rugged coast along beautiful Kilmeny Bay.&nbsp;
When they left the train, they were delighted with their outside
car, and reclined on their opposite sides in enchantment with the
fern-bordered lanes, winding between noble trees, between which
came inviting glimpses of exquisitely green meadows and
hill-sides.&nbsp; They stopped at a park-looking gate, leading to
the Devil&rsquo;s Glen, which they were to traverse on foot,
meeting the car at the other end.</p>
<p>Here there was just enough life and adventure to charm them,
as they gaily trod the path, winding picturesquely beside the
dashing, dancing, foaming stream, now between bare salient bluffs
of dark rock, now between glades of verdant thicket, or bold
shouldering slopes of purple heath and soft bent grass.&nbsp;
They were constantly crying out with delight, as they bounded
from one point of view to another, sometimes climbing among loose
stones, leading between ferns and hazel stems to a well-planted
hermitage, sometimes springing across the streamlet upon
stepping-stones.&nbsp; At the end of the wood another lodge-gate
brought them beyond the private grounds, that showed care, even
in their rusticity, and they came out on the open hill-side in
true mountain air, soft turf beneath their feet, the stream
rushing away at the bottom of the slope, and the view closed in
with blue mountains, on which the clouds marked purple
shadows.&nbsp; This was freedom! this was enjoyment! this was
worth the journey! and Cilla&rsquo;s elastic feet sprang along as
if she had been a young kid.&nbsp; How much was delight in the
scenery, how much in the scramble, need not be analyzed.</p>
<p>There was plenty of scrambling before it was over.&nbsp; A
woman who had been lying in wait for tourists at the gate, guided
them to the bend of the glen, where they were to climb up to pay
their respects to the waterfall.&nbsp; The ascent was not far
from perpendicular, only rendered accessible by the slope of
fallen debris at the base, and a few steps cut out from one
projecting rock to another, up to a narrow shelf, whence the
cascade was to be looked down on.&nbsp; The more adventurous
spirits went on to a rock overhanging the fall, and with a
curious chink or cranny, forming a window with a seat, and called
King O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; Each girl perched herself
there, and was complimented on her strong head and active limbs,
and all their powers were needed in the long breathless pull up
craggy stepping-stones, then over steep slippery turf, ere they
gained the summit of the bank.&nbsp; Spent, though still gasping
out, &lsquo;such fun!&rsquo; they threw themselves on their backs
upon the thymy grass, and lay still for several seconds ere they
sat up to look back at the thickly-wooded ravine, winding
crevice-like in and out between the <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>overlapping
skirts of the hills, whose rugged heads cut off the
horizon.&nbsp; Then merrily sharing the first instalment of
luncheon with their barefooted guide, they turned their faces
onwards, where all their way seemed one bare gray moor, rising
far off into the outline of Luggela, a peak overhanging the
semblance of a crater.</p>
<p>Nothing afforded them much more mirth than a rude bridge,
consisting of a single row of square-headed unconnected posts,
along the heads of which Cilla three times hopped backwards and
forwards for the mere drollery of the thing, with vigour unabated
by the long walk over the dreary moorland fields with their stone
walls.</p>
<p>By the side of the guide&rsquo;s cabin the car awaited them,
and mile after mile they drove on through treeless wastes, the
few houses with their thatch anchored down by stones, showing
what winds must sweep along those unsheltered tracts.&nbsp; The
desolate solitude began to weary the volatile pair into silence;
ere the mountains rose closer to them, they crossed a bridge over
a stony stream begirt with meadows, and following its course came
into sight of their goal.</p>
<p>Here was Glendalough, a <i>cul de sac</i> between the
mountains, that shelved down, enclosing it on all sides save the
entrance, through which the river issued.&nbsp; Their summits
were bare, of the gray stone that lay in fragments everywhere,
but their sides were clothed with the lovely Irish green
pasture-land, intermixed with brushwood and trees, and a
beauteous meadow surrounded the white ring-like beach of pure
white sand and pebbles bordering the outer lake, whose gray
waters sparkled in the sun.&nbsp; Its twin lake, divided from it
by so narrow a belt of ground, that the white beaches lay on
their green setting, like the outline of a figure of 8, had a
more wild and gloomy aspect, lying deeper within the hollow, and
the hills coming sheer down on it at the further end in all their
grayness unsoftened by any verdure.&nbsp; The gray was that of
absolute black and white intermingled in the grain of the stone,
and this was peculiarly gloomy, but in the summer sunshine it
served but to set off the brilliance of the verdure, and the
whole air of the valley was so bright that Cilly declared that it
had been traduced, and that no skylark of sense need object
thereto.</p>
<p>Losing sight of the lakes as they entered the shabby little
town, they sprang off the car before a small inn, and ere their
feet were on the ground were appropriated by one of a shoal of
guides, in dress and speech an ultra Irishman, exaggerating his
part as a sort of buffoon for the travellers.&nbsp; Rashe was
diverted by his humours; Cilla thought them in bad taste, and
would fain have escaped from his brogue and his antics, with some
perception that the scene ought to be left to make its impression
in peace.</p>
<p>Small peace, however, was there among the scores of men,
women, and children within the rude walls containing the most
noted relics; all beset the visitors with offers of stockings,
lace, <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>or stones from the hills; and the
chatter of the guide was a lesser nuisance for which she was
forced to compound for the sake of his protection.&nbsp; When he
had cleared away his compatriots, she was able to see the remains
of two of the Seven Churches, the Cathedral, and St.
Kevin&rsquo;s Kitchen, both of enduring gray stone, covered with
yellow lichen, which gave a remarkable golden tint to their
extreme old age.&nbsp; Architecture there was next to none.&nbsp;
St. Kevin&rsquo;s so-called kitchen had a cylindrical tower,
crowned by an extinguisher, and within the roofless walls was a
flat stone, once the altar, and still a station for pilgrims; and
the cathedral contained two broken coffin-lids with floriated
crosses, but it was merely four rude roofless walls, enclosing
less space than a cottage kitchen, and less ornamental than many
a barn.&nbsp; The whole space was encumbered with regular modern
headstones, ugly as the worst that English graveyards could show,
and alternating between the names of Byrne and O&rsquo;Toole,
families who, as the guide said, would come &lsquo;hundreds of
miles to lie there.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a grand thought, that
those two lines, in wealth or in poverty, had been constant to
that one wild mountain burying-place, in splendour or in ruin,
for more than twelve centuries.</p>
<p>Here, some steps from the cathedral on the top of the slope
was the chief grandeur of the view.&nbsp; A noble old carved
granite cross, eight or ten feet high, stood upon the brow,
bending slightly to one side, and beyond lay the valley
cherishing its treasure of the twin lakelets, girt in by the band
across them, nestled in the soft lining of copsewood and meadow,
and protected by the lofty massive hills above.&nbsp; In front,
but below, and somewhat to the right, lay another enclosure,
containing the ivied gable of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, and the
tall column-like Round Tower, both with the same peculiar golden
hoariness.&nbsp; The sight struck Lucilla with admiration and
wonder, but the next moment she heard the guide exhorting Rashe
to embrace the stem of the cross, telling her that if she could
clasp her arms round it, she would be sure of a handsome and rich
husband within the year.</p>
<p>Half superstitious, and always eager for fun, Horatia spread
her arms in the endeavour, but her hands could not have met
without the aid of the guide, who dragged them together, and
celebrated the exploit with a hurrah of congratulation, while she
laughed triumphantly, and called on her companion to try her
luck.&nbsp; But Lucy was disgusted, and bluntly refused, knowing
her grasp to be far too small, unable to endure the touch of the
guide, and maybe shrinking from the failure of the augury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! to be shure, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s not such a purty
young lady as yourself that need be taking the trouble,&rsquo;
did not fall pleasantly on her ears, and still less Ratia&rsquo;s
laugh and exclamation, &lsquo;You make too sure, do you?&nbsp;
Have a care.&nbsp; There were black looks at parting!&nbsp; But
you need not be afraid, if handsome be a part of the
spell.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>There was no answer, and Horatia saw that the outspoken
raillery that Cilly had once courted now gave offence.&nbsp; She
guessed that something was amiss, but did not know that what had
once been secure had been wilfully imperilled, and that suspense
was awakening new feelings of delicacy and tenderness.</p>
<p>The light words and vulgar forecasting had, in spite of
herself, transported Lucilla from the rocky thicket where she was
walking, even to the cedar room at Woolstone-lane, and conjured
up before her that grave, massive brow, and the eye that would
not meet her.&nbsp; She had hurried to these wilds to escape that
influence, and it was holding her tighter than ever.&nbsp; To
hasten home on account of Mr. Calthorp&rsquo;s pursuit would be
the most effectual vindication of the feminine dignity that she
might have impaired in Robert&rsquo;s eyes, but to do this on
what Ratia insisted on believing a false alarm would be the
height of absurdity.&nbsp; She was determined on extracting
proofs sufficient to justify her return, and every moment seemed
an hour until she could feel herself free to set her face
homewards.&nbsp; A strange impatience seized her at every spot
where the guide stopped them to admire, and Ratia&rsquo;s
encouragement of his witticisms provoked her excessively.</p>
<p>With a kind of despair she found herself required, before
taking boat for St. Kevin&rsquo;s Cave, to mount into a wood to
admire another waterfall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See two waterfalls,&rsquo; she muttered, &lsquo;and you
have seen them all.&nbsp; There are only two kinds, one a bucket
of water thrown down from the roof of a house, the other over a
staircase.&nbsp; Either the water was a fiction, or you
can&rsquo;t get at them for the wet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a splendid fellow at the Devil&rsquo;s
Glen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s as good a one any day at the lock on the
canal at home! only we do not delude people into coming to see
it.&nbsp; Up such places, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilly, for shame.&nbsp; What, tired and giving
in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not tired in the least; only this place is not worth
getting late for the train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will the young lady take my hand?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be
proud to have the honour of helping her up,&rsquo; said the
guide.&nbsp; But Lucilla disdainfully rejected his aid, and
climbed among the stones and brushwood aloof from the others,
Ratia talking in high glee to the Irishman, and adventurously
scrambling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilly, here it is,&rsquo; she cried, from beneath a
projecting elbow of rock; &lsquo;you look down on it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a delicious fall.&nbsp; I declare one can get into
it;&rsquo; and, by the aid of a tree, she lowered herself down on
a flat stone, whence she could see the cascade better than
above.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is stunning.&nbsp; I vow one can get
right into the bed of the stream right across.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
be slow, Cilly; this is the prime fun of all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You care for the romp and nothing else,&rsquo; grumbled
Lucilla.&nbsp; That boisterous merriment was hateful to her, when
feeling that the demeanour of gentlewomen must be their
protection, <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>and with all her high spirit, she
was terrified lest insult or remark should be occasioned.&nbsp;
Her signs of remonstrance were only received with a derisive
outburst, as Rashe climbed down into the midst of the bed of the
stream.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, Cilla, or I shall indite a page in the
diary, headed Faint heart&mdash;Ah!&rsquo; as her foot slipped on
the stones, and she fell backwards, but with instant efforts at
rising, such as assured her cousin that no harm was done,
&lsquo;Nay, Nonsensical clambering will be the word,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Serves you right for getting into such places!&nbsp;
What! hurt!&rsquo; as Horatia, after resting in a sitting
posture, tried to get up, but paused, with a cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; but another attempt ended in the
same way.&nbsp; Cilla sprang to her, followed by the guide,
imprecating bad luck to the slippery stones.&nbsp; Herself
standing in the water, Lucilla drew her cousin upright, and with
a good deal of help from the guide, and much suffering, brought
her up the high bank, and down the rough steep descent through
the wood.</p>
<p>She had given her back and side a severe twist, but she moved
less painfully on more level ground, and, supported between
Lucilla and the guide, whom the mischance had converted from a
comedy clown to a delicately considerate assistant, she set out
for the inn where the car had been left.&nbsp; The progress
lasted for two doleful hours, every step worse than the last,
and, much exhausted, she at length sank upon the sofa in the
little sitting-room of the inn.</p>
<p>The landlady was urgent that the wet clothes should be taken
off; and the back rubbed with whiskey, but Cilla stood agitating
her small soaked foot, and insisting that the car should come
round at once, since the wet had dried on them, and they had best
lose no time in returning to Dublin, or at least to Bray.</p>
<p>But Rashe cried out that the car would be the death of her;
she could not stir without a night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And be all the stiffer to-morrow?&nbsp; Once on the
car, you will be very comfortable&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t!&nbsp; This is a horrid
place.&nbsp; Of all the unlucky things that could have
happened&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Cilla, fancying a little coercion
would be wholesome, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be faint-hearted.&nbsp;
You will be glad to-morrow that I had the sense to make you move
to-day.&nbsp; I shall order the car.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; cried Horatia, her temper yielding to
pain and annoyance; &lsquo;you seem to forget that this
expedition is mine!&nbsp; I am paymaster, and have the only right
to decide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla felt the taunt base, as recalling to her the dependent
position into which she had carelessly rushed, relying on the
family feeling that had hitherto made all things as one.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Henceforth,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I take my share of all
that we spend.&nbsp; I will not sell my free will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you mean to leave me here alone?&rsquo; said
Horatia, with positive tears of pain, weariness, and vexation at
the cruel unfriendliness of the girl she had petted.</p>
<p><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; I must abide by your fate.&nbsp;
I only hate to see people chicken-hearted, and thought you wanted
shaking up.&nbsp; I stay so long as you own me an independent
agent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The discussion was given up, when it was announced that a room
was ready; and Rashe underwent so much in climbing the stairs,
that Cilly thought she could not have been worse on the car.</p>
<p>The apartment was not much behind that at the village inn at
Hiltonbury.&nbsp; In fact, it had gay curtains and a grand
figured blind, but the door at the Charlecote Arms had no such
independent habits of opening, the carpet would have been whole,
and the chairs would not have creaked beneath Lucy&rsquo;s
grasshopper weight; when down she sat in doleful resignation,
having undressed her cousin, sent her <i>chaussure</i> to dry,
and dismissed the car, with a sense of bidding farewell to the
civilized world, and entering a desert island, devoid of the zest
of Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>What an endless evening it was, and how the ladies detested
each other!&nbsp; There lay Horatia, not hurt enough for alarm,
but quite cross enough to silence pity, suffering at every move,
and sore at Cilly&rsquo;s want of compassion; and here sat
Lucilla, thoroughly disgusted with her cousin, her situation, and
her expedition.&nbsp; Believing the strain a trifle, she not
unjustly despised the want of resolution that had shrunk from so
expedient an exertion as the journey, and felt injured by the
selfish want of consideration that had condemned her to this
awkward position in this forlorn little inn, without even the few
toilette necessaries that they had with them at Dublin, and with
no place to sit in, for the sitting-room below stairs served as a
coffee-room, where sundry male tourists were imbibing whiskey,
the fumes of which ascended to the young ladies above, long
before they could obtain their own meal.</p>
<p>The chops were curiosities; and as to the tea, the grounds,
apparently the peat of the valley, filled up nearly an eighth of
the cup, causing Lucilla in lugubrious mirth to talk of
&lsquo;That lake whose gloomy tea, ne&rsquo;er saw Hyson nor
Bohea,&rsquo; when Rashe fretfully retorted, &lsquo;It is very
unkind in you to grumble at everything, when you know I
can&rsquo;t help it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not grumbling, I only wanted to enliven
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Queer enlivenment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor did Lucilla&rsquo;s attempts at body curing succeed
better.&nbsp; Her rubbing only evoked screeches, and her advice
was scornfully rejected.&nbsp; Horatia was a determined
hom&oelig;opath, and sighed for the globules in her wandering
box, and as whiskey and tobacco both became increasingly
fragrant, averred again and again that nothing should induce her
to stay here another night.</p>
<p>Nothing?&nbsp; Lucilla found her in the morning in all the
aches and flushes of a feverish cold, her sprain severely
painful, her eyes swollen, her throat so sore, that in alarm
Cilly besought her to send for advice; but Rashe regarded a
murderous <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>allopathist as near akin to an
executioner, and only bewailed the want of her minikin doses.</p>
<p>Giving up the hope of an immediate departure, Lucilla
despatched a messenger to Bray, thence to telegraph for the
luggage; and the day was spent in fears lest their landlord at
Dublin might detain their goods as those of suspicious
characters.</p>
<p>Other excitement there was none, not even in quarrelling, for
Rashe was in a sleepy state, only roused by interludes of gloomy
tea and greasy broth; and outside, the clouds had closed down,
such clouds as she had never seen, blotting out lake and mountain
with an impervious gray curtain, seeming to bathe rather than to
rain on the place.&nbsp; She longed to dash out into it, but
Ratia&rsquo;s example warned her against drenching her only
garments, though indoors the dryness was only comparative.&nbsp;
Everything she touched, herself included, seemed pervaded by a
damp, limp rawness, that she vainly tried to dispel by ordering a
fire.&nbsp; The turf smouldered, the smoke came into the room,
and made their eyes water, and Rashe insisted that the fire
should be put out.</p>
<p>Cilla almost envied her sleep, as she sat disconsolate in the
window, watching the comparative density of the rain, and
listening to the extraordinary howls and shrieks in the town,
which kept her constantly expecting that a murder or a rebellion
would come to relieve the monotony of the day, till she found
that nothing ensued, and no one took any notice.</p>
<p>She tried to sketch from memory, but nothing would hinder that
least pleasant of occupations&mdash;thought.&nbsp; Either she
imagined every unpleasant chance of detention, she worried
herself about Robert Fulmort, or marvelled what Mr. Prendergast
and the censorious ladies would do with Edna Murrell.&nbsp; Many
a time did she hold her watch to her ear, suspecting it of having
stopped, so slowly did it loiter through the weary hours.&nbsp;
Eleven o&rsquo;clock when she hoped it was one&mdash;half-past
two when it felt like five.</p>
<p>By real five, the mist was thinner, showing first nearer, then
remoter objects; the coarse slates of the roofs opposite emerged
polished and dripping, and the cloud finally took its leave, some
heavy flakes, like cotton wool, hanging on the hill-side, and
every rock shining, every leaf glistening.&nbsp; Verdure and rosy
cheeks both resulted from a perpetual vapour-bath.</p>
<p>Lucilla rejoiced in her liberty, and hurried out of doors, but
leaning out of the coffee-room window, loungers were seen who
made her sensible of the awkwardness of her position, and she
looked about for yesterday&rsquo;s guide as a friend, but he was
not at hand, and her uneasy gaze brought round her numbers,
begging or offering guidance.&nbsp; She wished to retreat, but
would not, and walked briskly along the side of the valley
opposite to that she had yesterday visited, in search of the
other four churches.&nbsp; Two fragments were at the junction of
the lakes, another was entirely destroyed, but the last, called
the Abbey, stood in ruins within the same wall as the Round
Tower, which rose straight, round, mysterious, defying inquiry,
as it caught <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the evening light on its summit,
even as it had done for so many centuries past.</p>
<p>Not that Cilla thought of the riddles of that tower, far less
of the early Christianity of the isle of saints, of which these
ruins and their wild legend were the only vestiges, nor of the
mysticism that planted clusters of churches in sevens as
analogous to the seven stars of the Apocalypse.&nbsp; Even the
rugged glories of the landscape chiefly addressed themselves to
her as good to sketch, her highest flight in admiration of the
picturesque.&nbsp; In the state of mind ascribed to the ancients,
she only felt the weird unhomelikeness of the place, as though
she were at the ends of the earth, unable to return, and always
depressed by solitude; she could have wept.&nbsp; Was it for this
that she had risked the love that had been her own from
childhood, and broken with the friend to whom her father had
commended her?&nbsp; Was it worth while to defy their censures
for this dreary spot, this weak-spirited, exacting, unrefined
companion, and the insult of Mr. Calthorp&rsquo;s pursuit?</p>
<p>Naturally shrewd, well knowing the world, and guarded by a
real attachment, Lucilla had never regarded the
millionaire&rsquo;s attentions as more than idle amusement in
watching the frolics of a beauty, and had suffered them as adding
to her own diversion; but his secretly following her, no doubt to
derive mirth from her proceedings, revealed to her that woman
could not permit such terms without loss of dignity, and her
cheek burnt at the thought of the ludicrous light in which he
might place her present predicament before a conclave of
gentlemen.</p>
<p>The thought was intolerable.&nbsp; To escape it by rapid
motion, she turned hastily to leave the enclosure.&nbsp; A figure
was climbing over the steps in the wall with outstretched hand,
as if he expected her to cling to him, and Mr. Calthorp,
springing forward, eagerly exclaimed in familiar, patronizing
tones, &lsquo;Miss Sandbrook!&nbsp; They told me you were gone
this way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, in a very different voice at the
unexpected look and bow that he encountered: &lsquo;I hope Miss
Charteris&rsquo;s accident is not serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, not serious,&rsquo; was the freezing
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad.&nbsp; How did it occur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a fall.&rsquo;&nbsp; He should have no good
story wherewith to regale his friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going on well, I trust?&nbsp; Chancing to be at Dublin,
I heard by accident you were here, and fearing that there might
be a difficulty, I ran down in the hope of being of service to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; in the least thankful of tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there nothing I can do for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could I not obtain some advice for Miss
Charteris?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, she wishes for none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure&rsquo;&mdash;he spoke
eagerly&mdash;&lsquo;that in some way I could be of use to
you.&nbsp; I shall remain at hand.&nbsp; I cannot bear that you
should be alone in this remote place.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&lsquo;Thank you, we will not put you to
inconvenience.&nbsp; We intended to be alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see you esteem it a great liberty,&rsquo; said poor
Mr. Calthorp; &lsquo;but you must forgive my impulse to see
whether I could be of any assistance to you.&nbsp; I will do as
you desire, but at least you will let me leave Stefano with you;
he is a fellow full of resources, who would make you comfortable
here, and me easy about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, we require no one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;s&rsquo; were intolerable, but
her defensive reserve and dignity attracted the gentleman more
than all her dashing brilliancy, and he became more urgent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You cannot ask me to leave you entirely to yourselves
under such circumstances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I more than ask it, I insist upon it.&nbsp; Good
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Sandbrook, do not go till you have heard and
forgiven me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not hear you, Mr. Calthorp.&nbsp; This is
neither the time nor place,&rsquo; said Lucilla, inly more and
more perturbed, but moving along with slow, quiet steps, and
betraying no emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;The object of our journey was
totally defeated by meeting any of our ordinary acquaintance, and
but for this mischance I should have been on my way home
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Miss Sandbrook, do you class me among your ordinary
acquaintance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was all she could do to hinder her walk from losing its
calm slowness, and before she could divest her intended reply of
undignified sharpness, he continued: &lsquo;Who could have
betrayed my presence?&nbsp; But for this, I meant that you should
never have been aware that I was hovering near to watch over
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, to collect good stories for your club.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is injustice!&nbsp; Flagrant injustice, Miss
Sandbrook!&nbsp; Will you not credit the anxiety that
irresistibly impelled me to be ever at hand in case you should
need a protector?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the point-blank reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shall I convince you?&rsquo; he cried,
vehemently.&nbsp; &lsquo;What have I done that you should refuse
to believe in the feelings that prompted me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; said Lucilla, whose blood
was up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have taken a liberty, which is the best
proof of what your feelings are, and every moment that you force
your presence on me adds to the offence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw that she had succeeded.&nbsp; He stood still, bowed,
and answered not, possibly deeming this the most effective means
of recalling her; but from first to last he had not known Lucilla
Sandbrook.</p>
<p>The eager, protecting familiarity of his first address had
given her such a shock that she felt certain that she had no
guard but herself from positively insulting advances; and though
abstaining from all quickening of pace, her heart throbbed
violently in the fear of hearing him following her, and the inn
was a haven of refuge.</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>She flew up to her bedroom to tear about like a
panther, as if by violence to work down the tumult in her
breast.&nbsp; She had proved the truth of Honora&rsquo;s warning,
that beyond the pale of ordinary <i>convenances</i>, a woman is
exposed to insult, and however sufficient she may be for her own
protection, the very fact of having to defend herself is
well-nigh degradation.&nbsp; It was not owning the error.&nbsp;
It was the agony of humiliation, not the meekness of humility,
and she was as angry with Miss Charlecote for the prediction as
with Mr. Calthorp for having fulfilled it, enraged with Horatia,
and desperate at her present imprisoned condition, unable to
escape, and liable to be still haunted by her enemy.</p>
<p>At last she saw the discomfited swain re-enter the inn, his
car come round, and finally drive off with him; and then she felt
what a blank was her victory.&nbsp; If she breathed freely, it
was at the cost of an increased sense of solitude and severance
from the habitable world.</p>
<p>Hitherto she had kept away from her cousin, trusting that the
visit might remain a secret, too mortifying to both parties to be
divulged, but she found Horatia in a state of eager anticipation,
awakened from the torpor to watch for tidings of a happy
conclusion to their difficulties, and preparing jests on the
pettish ingratitude with which she expected Lucilla to requite
the services that would be nevertheless accepted.</p>
<p>Gone!&nbsp; Sent away!&nbsp; Not even commissioned to find the
boxes.&nbsp; Horatia&rsquo;s consternation and irritation knew no
bounds.&nbsp; Lucilla was no less indignant that she could
imagine it possible to become dependent on his good offices, or
to permit him to remain in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Rashe angrily
scoffed at her newborn scruples, and complained of her want of
consideration for herself.&nbsp; Cilla reproached her cousin with
utter absence of any sense of propriety and decorum.&nbsp; Rashe
talked of ingratitude, and her sore throat being by this time
past conversation, she came to tears.&nbsp; Cilla, who could not
bear to see any one unhappy, tried many a &lsquo;never
mind,&rsquo; many a &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t mean,&rsquo; many a fair
augury for the morrow, but all in vain, and night came down upon
the Angel Anglers more forlorn and less friendly than ever; and
with all the invalid&rsquo;s discomforts so much aggravated by
the tears and the altercation, that escape from this gloomy shore
appeared infinitely remote.</p>
<p>There was an essential difference of tone of mind between
those brought up at Hiltonbury or at Castle Blanch, and though
high spirits had long concealed the unlikeness, it had now been
made bare, and Lucy could not conquer her disgust and
disappointment.</p>
<p>Sunshine was on Luggela, and Horatia&rsquo;s ailments were
abating, so, as her temper was not alleviated, Lucilla thought
peace would be best preserved by sallying out to sketch.&nbsp; A
drawing from behind the cross became so engrossing that she was
sorry to find it time for the early dinner, and her artistic <!--
page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>pride was only allayed by the conviction that she
should always hate what recalled Glendalough.</p>
<p>Rashe was better, and was up and dressed.&nbsp; Hopes of
departure produced amity, and they were almost lively over their
veal broth, when sounds of arrival made Lucilla groan at the
prospect of cockney tourists obstructing the completion of her
drawing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman asking to see you,
Miss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can see no one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla, now do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him I cannot see him,&rsquo; repeated Lucy,
imperiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you be so silly? he may have heard of our
boxes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would toss them into the lake rather than take them
from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh! pray let me be present when you perform the
ceremony!&nbsp; Cilla in the heroics!&nbsp; Whom is she
expecting?&rsquo; said a voice outside the door, ever ajar, a
voice that made Lucilla clasp her hands in ecstasy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, Owen! come in,&rsquo; cried Horatia, writhing
herself up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, old Owen! that&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; burst from
Cilla, as she sprang to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right!&nbsp; Ah! that is not the greeting I expected; I
was thinking how to guard my eyes.&nbsp; So, you have had enough
of the unprotected dodge!&nbsp; What has Rashe been doing to
herself?&nbsp; A desperate leap down the falls of
Niagara.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Horatia was diffuse in the narration; but, after the first,
Lucy did not speak.&nbsp; She began by arming herself against her
brother&rsquo;s derision, but presently felt perplexed by
detecting on his countenance something unwontedly grave and
preoccupied.&nbsp; She was sure that his attention was far away
from Rashe&rsquo;s long story, and she abruptly interrupted it
with, &lsquo;How came you here, Owen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not seem to hear, and she demanded, &lsquo;Is anything
the matter?&nbsp; Are you come to fetch us because any one is
ill?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Starting, he said, &lsquo;No, oh no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what brought you here? a family council, or Honor
Charlecote?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor Charlecote,&rsquo; he repeated mistily: then,
making an effort, &lsquo;Yes, good old soul, she gave me a
vacation tour on condition that I should keep an eye on
you.&nbsp; Go on, Rashe; what were you saying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me, Owen?&nbsp; Why, Calthorp,
the great Calthorp, is in our wake.&nbsp; Cilly is
frantic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Calthorp about!&rsquo; exclaimed Owen, with a start of
dismay.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve disposed of him,&rsquo; quoth Lucilla;
&lsquo;he&rsquo;ll not trouble us again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which way is he gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not tell you if I knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be such an idiot,&rsquo; he petulantly
answered; &lsquo;I want <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>nothing of
the fellow, only to know whether he is clean gone.&nbsp; Are you
sure whether he went by Bray?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you I neither knew nor cared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you have believed, Owen,&rsquo; said Rashe,
plaintively, &lsquo;that she was so absurd as never even to tell
him to inquire for our boxes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen knows better;&rsquo; but Lucilla stopped,
surprised to see that his thoughts were again astray.&nbsp;
Giving a constrained smile, he asked, &lsquo;Well, what
next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To find our boxes,&rsquo; they answered in a
breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your boxes?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I&rsquo;ve
got them here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, you&rsquo;re a trump,&rsquo; cried Rashe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How on earth did you know about them?&rsquo; inquired
his sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very simply; crossed from Liverpool yesterday,
reconnoitred at your hotel, was shown your telegram, went to the
luggage-office, routed out that the things were taking a gentle
tour to Limerick, got them back this morning, and came on.&nbsp;
And what are you after next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home,&rsquo; jerked out Lucy, without looking up,
thinking how welcome he would have been yesterday, without the
goods.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, home,&rsquo; said Horatia.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
abominable sprain will hinder my throwing a line, or jolting on
Irish roads, and if Cilla is to be in agonies when she sees a man
on the horizon, we might as well never have come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you help me to carry home this poor invalid
warrior, Owen?&rsquo; said Lucilla; &lsquo;she will permit
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put you into the steamer,&rsquo; said Owen;
&lsquo;but you see, I have made my arrangements for doing
Killarney and the rest of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare,&rsquo; said Rashe, recovering benevolence
with comfort, &lsquo;if they would send Scott from the castle to
meet me at Holyhead, Cilly might as well go on with you.&nbsp;
You would be sufficient to keep off the Calthorps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s no go,&rsquo; hesitated
Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see I had made my plans, trusting to your
bold assertions that you would suffer no one to
approach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! never mind.&nbsp; It was no proposal of mine.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve had enough of Ireland,&rsquo; returned Lucy, somewhat
aggrieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How soon shall you be sufficiently repaired for a
start, Ratia?&rsquo; asked Owen, turning quickly round to
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;To-morrow?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
come over and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going away?&rsquo; cried the ladies, by no means
willing to part with their guardian.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I must.&nbsp; Expecting that we should be
parallels never meeting, I had to provide for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Rashe; &lsquo;he has a merry party
at Newragh Bridge, and will sit up over whist and punch till
midnight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t pretend to put yourselves in
competition,&rsquo; said he, snatching at the idea hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! no,&rsquo; said his sister, with an annoyed
gesture.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never expect you to prefer me and my
comfort to any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&lsquo;Indeed, Cilla, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; he
answered gently, but in perplexity, &lsquo;but I never reckoned
on being wanted, and engagements are engagements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want you when anything
pleasanter is going forward,&rsquo; she answered, with vexation
in her tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be here by eleven or twelve,&rsquo; he
replied, avoiding the altercation; &lsquo;but I must get back
now.&nbsp; I shall be waited for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it that can&rsquo;t wait?&rsquo; asked
Rashe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! just an English acquaintance of mine.&nbsp; There,
goodbye.&nbsp; I wish I had come in time to surprise the modern
St. Kevin!&nbsp; Are you sure there was no drowning in the
lake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know it was blessed to drown no one after
Kathleen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reassuring!&nbsp; Only mind you put a chapter about it
into the tour.&rsquo;&nbsp; Under the cover of these words he was
gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare there&rsquo;s some mystery about his
companion!&rsquo; exclaimed Horatia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose it were
Calthorp himself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen is not so lost to respect for his
sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But did you not see how little he was surprised, and
how much preoccupied?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely; but no one but you could imagine him
capable of such an outrage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been crazy ever since you entered Ireland, and
expect every one else to be the same.&nbsp; Seriously, what
damage did you anticipate from a little civility?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you begin upon that, I shall go out and finish my
sketch, and not unpack one of the boxes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lucilla spent much fretting guesswork on her
cousin&rsquo;s surmise.&nbsp; She relied too much on Owen&rsquo;s
sense of propriety to entertain the idea that he could be
forwarding a pursuit so obviously insolent, but a still wilder
conjecture had been set afloat in her mind.&nbsp; Could the
nameless one be Robert Fulmort?&nbsp; Though aware of the
anonymous nature of brother&rsquo;s friends, the secrecy struck
her as unusually guarded; and to one so used to devotion, it
seemed no extraordinary homage that another admirer should be
drawn along at a respectful distance, a satellite to her erratic
course; nay, probably all had been concerted in Woolstone-lane,
and therewith the naughty girl crested her head, and prepared to
take offence.&nbsp; After all, it could not be, or why should
Owen have been bent on returning, and be so independent of
her?&nbsp; Far more probably he had met a college friend or a
Westminster schoolfellow, some of whom were in regiments
quartered in Ireland, and on the morrow would bring him to do the
lions of Glendalough, among which might be reckoned the Angel
Anglers!</p>
<p>That possibility might have added some grains to the
satisfaction of making a respectable toilette next day.&nbsp;
Certain it is that Miss Sandbrook&rsquo;s mountain costume was an
exquisite feat of elaborate simplicity, and that the completion
of her sketch was interrupted by many a backward look down the
pass, and many a contradictory mood, sometimes boding almost as
harsh <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>a reception for Robert as for Mr.
Calthorp, sometimes relenting in the thrill of hope, sometimes
accusing herself of arrant folly, and expecting as a <i>pis
aller</i> the diversion of dazzling and tormenting an Oxonian, or
a soldier or two!&nbsp; Be the meeting what it might, she
preferred that it should be out of Horatia&rsquo;s sight, and so
drew on and on to the detriment of her distances.</p>
<p>Positively it was past twelve, and the desire to be surprised
unconcernedly occupied could no longer obviate her restlessness,
so she packed up her hair-pencil, and, walking back to the inn,
found Rashe in solitary possession of the coffee-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have missed him, Cilly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen?&nbsp; No one else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not the Calthorp; I am sorry for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But who was here? tell me, Rashe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, I tell you,&rsquo; repeated Horatia, playing with
her impatience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me; I will know whether he has any one with
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alack for your disappointment, for the waste of that
blue bow; not a soul came here but himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where is he? how did I miss him?&rsquo; said
Lucilla, forcibly repressing the mortification for which her
cousin was watching.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone.&nbsp; As I was not in travelling trim, and you
not forthcoming, he could not wait; but we are to be off
to-morrow at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did he not come out to find me?&nbsp; Did you tell
him I was close by?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had to join his friend, and go to the Vale of
Avoca.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found out the man, Cilla.&nbsp; No,
don&rsquo;t look so much on the <i>qui vive</i>; it&rsquo;s only
Jack Hastings!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack Hastings!&rsquo; said Lucilla, her looks
fallen.&nbsp; &lsquo;No wonder he would not bring him
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not, poor fellow?&nbsp; I used to know him very
well before he was up the spout.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish Owen had not fallen in with him,&rsquo; said the
sister, gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you certain it is so,
Rashe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I taxed him with it, and he did not deny it; only put
it from him, laughing.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the harm?&nbsp; Poor
Jack was always a good-natured, honourable fellow, uncommonly
clever and amusing&mdash;a well-read man, too; and Owen is safe
enough&mdash;no one could try to borrow of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would Honor&rsquo;s feelings be?&rsquo; said
Lucilla, with more fellow-feeling for her than for months
past.&nbsp; Lax as was the sister&rsquo;s tolerance, she was
startled at his becoming the associate of an avowedly loose
character under the stigma of the world, and with perilous
abilities and agreeableness; and it was another of
Horatia&rsquo;s offences against proper feeling, not only to
regard such evil communications with indifference, but absolutely
to wish to be brought into contact with a person of this
description in their present isolated state.&nbsp; Displeased and
uneasy, Lucilla assumed the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of petulance and
<!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>quarrelsomeness for the rest of the day, and revenged
herself to the best of her abilities upon Rashe and Owen, by
refusing to go to inspect the scene of Kathleen&rsquo;s fatal
repulse.</p>
<p>True to his appointment, Owen arrived alone on a car chosen
with all regard to Horatia&rsquo;s comfort, and was most actively
attentive in settling on it the ladies and their luggage,
stretching himself out on the opposite side, his face raised to
the clouds, as he whistled an air; but his eye was still
restless, and his sister resolved on questioning him.</p>
<p>Opportunities were, however, rare; whether or not with the
design of warding off a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, he
devoted himself to his cousin&rsquo;s service in a manner rare to
her since she had laid herself out to be treated as though her
name were Horace instead of Horatia.&nbsp; However, Lucilla was
not the woman to be balked of a settled purpose; and at their
hotel, at Dublin, she nailed him fast by turning back on him when
Horatia bade them good night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, what do you
want?&rsquo; he asked, annoyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to speak to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it is to beg me to write to ask Honor to receive
you at home, and promise to behave like a decent and respectable
person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want neither a judge nor an intercessor in
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Lucy, it really would be for every one&rsquo;s
good if you would go and take care of poor Honor.&nbsp; You have
been using her vilely, and I should think you&rsquo;d had enough
of Rashe for one while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I have used her vilely, at least I have dealt openly
by her,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has always seen the
worst of me on the surface.&nbsp; Can you bear to talk of her
when you know how you are treating her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He coloured violently, and his furious gesture would have
intimidated most sisters; but she stood her ground, and answered
his stammering demand what she dared to imply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may go into a passion, but you cannot hinder me
from esteeming it shameful to make her mission a cover for
associating with one whom she would regard with so much horror as
Jack Hastings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack Hastings!&rsquo; cried Owen, to her amazement,
bursting into a fit of laughter, loud, long, and explosive.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well done, Rashe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You told her so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She told me so, and one does not contradict a
lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something must have put it into her head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to be accounted for by an unrequited
attachment,&rsquo; laughed Owen; &lsquo;depend on it, a
comparison of dates would show Hastings&rsquo;s incarceration to
have been the epoch of Rashe&rsquo;s taking to the high masculine
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If e&rsquo;er she loved, &rsquo;twas
him alone<br />
Who lived within the jug of stone.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Owen; Rashe never was in love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he went on laughing at Rashe&rsquo;s disappointment at his
solitary arrival till she said, tartly, &lsquo;You cannot wonder
at our <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>thinking you must have some reason
for neither mentioning your companion&rsquo;s name nor bringing
him with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact, no man not under a cloud could abstain from
paying homage to the queen of the anglers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was so true as to raise an angry spot on her cheek, and
provoke the hasty excuse, &lsquo;It would have been obvious to
have brought your friend to see your cousin and
sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One broken-backed, both unwashed!&nbsp; O, the
sincerity of the resistance I overheard!&nbsp; No gentleman
admitted, forsooth!&nbsp; O, for a lodge in some vast
wilderness!&nbsp; Yes; St. Anthony would have found it a
wilderness indeed without his temptations.&nbsp; What would St.
Dunstan have been minus the black gentleman&rsquo;s nose, or St.
Kevin but for Kathleen?&nbsp; It was a fortunate interposition
that Calthorp turned up the day before I came, or I might have
had to drag the lake for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This personal attack only made her persist.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was very different when we were alone or with you; you know very
well that there could have been no objection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No objection on your side, certainly, so I perceive;
but suppose there were no desire on the other?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; in a piqued voice, &lsquo;I know many men
don&rsquo;t care for ladies&rsquo; society, but I don&rsquo;t see
why they should be nameless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you would deem such a name unworthy to be
mentioned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but who is the shy man?&nbsp; Is it the little
Henniker, who used to look as if he would dive under the table
when you brought him from Westminster?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I told you, you would remember it against the poor
creature for life, as a deliberate insult and want of
taste.&nbsp; Good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took his hat, and went out, leaving Lucy balancing her
guesses between Ensign Henniker and him whom she could not
mention.&nbsp; Her rejection of Mr. Calthorp might have
occasioned the present secrecy, and she was content to leave
herself the pleasant mystery, in the hope of having it dispelled
by her last glance of Kingstown quay.</p>
<p>In that hope, she rocked herself to sleep, and next morning
was so extra vivacious as to be a sore trial to poor Rashe, in
the anticipation of the <i>peine forte et dure</i> of St.
George&rsquo;s Channel.&nbsp; Owen was also in high spirits, but
a pattern of consideration and kind attention, as he saw the
ladies on board, and provided for their comfort, not leaving them
till the last moment.</p>
<p>Lucilla&rsquo;s heart had beaten fast from the moment she had
reached Kingstown; she was keeping her hand free to wave a most
encouraging kiss, and as her eye roamed over the heads upon the
quay without a recognition, she felt absolutely baffled and
cheated; and gloriously as the Bay of Dublin spread itself before
her, she was conscious only of wrath and mortification, and of a
bitter sense of dreariness and desertion.&nbsp; Nobody cared for
her, not even her brother!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Can you come and take a turn in the Temple-gardens,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; asked Robert, on the way from church, the day
after Owen&rsquo;s visit to Woolstone-lane.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be rejoiced, for she had scarcely seen him since his
return from Castle Blanch, and his state of mind was a mystery to
her.&nbsp; It was long, however, before he afforded her any
clue.&nbsp; He paced on, grave and abstracted, and they had many
times gone up and down the least frequented path, before he
abruptly said, &lsquo;I have asked Mr. Parsons to give me a title
for Holy Orders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what that means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How simple you are, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said,
impatiently; &lsquo;it means that St. Wulstan&rsquo;s should be
my first curacy.&nbsp; May my labours be accepted as an endeavour
to atone for some of the evil we cause here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Robin! what did Mr. Parsons say?&nbsp; Was he not
very glad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; there lies the doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; He told me that he had engaged as many
curates as he has means for.&nbsp; I answered that my stipend
need be no consideration, for I only wished to spend on the
parish, but he was not satisfied.&nbsp; Many incumbents
don&rsquo;t like to have curates of independent means; I believe
it has an amateur appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Parsons cannot think you would not be
devoted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope to convince him that I may be trusted.&nbsp; It
is all that is left me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be very cruel to you, and to the poor people,
if he will not,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, warmly; &lsquo;what will
papa and Mervyn say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not mention it till all is settled; I have my
father&rsquo;s consent to my choice of a profession, and I do not
think myself bound to let him dictate my course as a
minister.&nbsp; I owe a higher duty and if his business scatters
the seeds of vice, surely &ldquo;obedience in the Lord&rdquo;
should not prevent me from trying to counteract them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a case of conscience to be only judged by himself, and
where even a sister like Ph&oelig;be could do little but hope for
the best, so she expressed a cheerful hope that her father must
know that it was right, and that he would care less now that he
was away, and pleased with Augusta&rsquo;s prospects.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;he already thinks me
such a fool, that it may be indifferent to him in what particular
manner I act it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&lsquo;And how does it stand with Mr.
Parsons?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will give me an answer to-morrow evening, provided I
continue in the same mind.&nbsp; There is no chance of my not
doing so.&nbsp; My time of suspense is over!&rsquo; and the words
absolutely sounded like relief, though the set stern face, and
the long breaths at each pause told another tale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not think she would really have gone!&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This once, and we will mention her no more.&nbsp; It is
not merely this expedition, but all I saw at Wrapworth convinced
me that I should risk my faithfulness to my calling by connecting
myself with one who, with all her loveliness and generosity,
lives upon excitement.&nbsp; She is the very light of poor
Prendergast&rsquo;s eyes, and he cannot endure to say a word in
her dispraise; she is constantly doing acts of kindness in his
parish, and is much beloved there, yet he could not conceal how
much trouble she gives him by her want of judgment and
wilfulness; patronizing and forgetting capriciously, and
attending to no remonstrance.&nbsp; You saw yourself the
treatment of that schoolmistress.&nbsp; I thought the more of
this, because Prendergast is so fond of her, and does her full
justice.&nbsp; No; her very aspect proves that a parish priest
has no business to think of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Large tears swelled in Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The
first vision of her youth was melting away, and she detected no
relenting in his grave resolute voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall you tell her?&rsquo; was all she could say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the question.&nbsp; At one time she gave me
reason to think that she accepted a claim to be considered in my
plans, and understood what I never concealed.&nbsp; Latterly she
has appeared to withdraw all encouragement, to reject every
advance, and yet&mdash;&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, tell me whether she
has given you any reason to suppose that she ever was in earnest
with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know she respects and likes you better than any one,
and speaks of you like no one else,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; then
pausing, and speaking more diffidently, though with a smile,
&lsquo;I think she looks up to you so much, that she is afraid to
put herself in your power, for fear she should be made to give up
her odd ways in spite of herself, and yet that she has no notion
of losing you.&nbsp; Did you see her face at the
station?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not!&nbsp; I could not meet her eyes!&nbsp; I
snatched my hand from the little clinging fingers;&rsquo; and
Robert&rsquo;s voice almost became a gasp.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
not fit that the spell should be renewed.&nbsp; She would be
miserable, I under constant temptation, if I endeavoured to make
her share my work!&nbsp; Best as it is!&nbsp; She has so cast me
off that my honour is no longer bound to her; but I cannot tell
whether it be due to her to let her know how it is with me, or
whether it would be mere coxcombry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Sunday that she spent here,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, slowly, &lsquo;she had a talk with me.&nbsp; I wrote
it down.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore says it is the safest
way&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; cried Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I kept it in my pocket-book, for fear any one should
see it, and it should do harm.&nbsp; Here it is, if it will help
you.&nbsp; I am afraid I made things worse, but I did not know
what to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was one of the boldest experiments ever made by a sister;
for what man could brook the sight of an unvarnished statement of
his proxy&rsquo;s pleading, or help imputing the failure to the
go-between?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not have had this happen for a thousand
pounds!&rsquo; was his acknowledgment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Child as you
are, Ph&oelig;be, had you not sense to know, that no woman could
endure to have that said, which should scarcely be implied?&nbsp;
I wonder no longer at her studied avoidance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be all my bad management, cannot it be set
right?&rsquo; humbly and hopefully said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no right!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There,
take it back.&nbsp; It settles the question.&nbsp; The security
you childishly showed, was treated as offensive presumption on my
part.&nbsp; It would be presuming yet farther to make a formal
withdrawal of what was never accepted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then is it my doing?&nbsp; Have I made mischief between
you, and put you apart?&rsquo; said poor Ph&oelig;be, in great
distress.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I make up for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You?&nbsp; No, you were only an over plain-spoken
child, and brought about the crisis that must have come
somehow.&nbsp; It is not what you have done, or not done; it is
what Lucy Sandbrook has said and done, shows that I must have
done with her for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, taking this as
forgiveness, &lsquo;you see she never believed that you would
give her up.&nbsp; If she did, I am sure she would not have
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks her power over me stronger than my
principles.&nbsp; She challenges me&mdash;desires you to tell me
so.&nbsp; We shall see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke as a man whose steadfastness had been defied, and who
was piqued on proving it to the utmost.&nbsp; Such feelings may
savour of the wrath of man, they may need the purifying of
chastening, and they often impel far beyond the bounds of sober
judgment; but no doubt they likewise frequently render that easy
which would otherwise have appeared impossible, and which, if
done in haste, may be regretted, but not repented, at
leisure.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances, the harshness of youth is a healthy
symptom, proving force of character and conviction, though that
is only when the foremost victim is self.&nbsp; Robert was far
from perfect, and it might be doubted whether he were entering
the right track in the right way, but at least his heart was
sound, and there was a fair hope that his failings, in working
their punishment, might work their cure.</p>
<p>It was in a thorough brotherly and Christian spirit that
before entering the house he compelled himself to say,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>vex yourself, Ph&oelig;be, I know
you did the best you could.&nbsp; It made no real difference, and
it was best that she should know the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, dear Robin,&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be,
grateful for the consolation; &lsquo;I am glad you do not think I
misrepresented.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are always accurate,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you did anything undesirable, it was representing at
all.&nbsp; But that is nothing to the purpose.&nbsp; It is all
over now, and thank you for your constant good-will and patience,
my dear.&nbsp; There! now then it is an understood thing that her
name is never spoken between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert&rsquo;s proposal was under discussion by the
elders.&nbsp; Mr. Parsons had no abstract dread of a wealthy
curate, but he hesitated to accept gratuitous services, and
distrusted plans formed under the impulse of disappointment or of
enthusiasm, since in the event of a change, both parties might be
embarrassed.&nbsp; There was danger too of collisions with his
family, and Mr. Parsons took counsel with Miss Charlecote,
knowing indeed that where her affections were concerned, her
opinions must be taken with a qualification, but relying on the
good sense formed by rectitude of purpose.</p>
<p>Honor&rsquo;s affection for Robert Fulmort had always been
moderated by Owen&rsquo;s antagonism; her moderation in
superlatives commanded implicit credence, and Mr. Parsons
inferred more, instead of less, than she expressed; better able
as he was to estimate that manly character, gaining force with
growth, and though slow to discern between good and evil, always
firm to the duty when it was once perceived, and thus rising with
the elevation of the standard.&nbsp; The undemonstrative temper
and tardiness in adopting extra habits of religious observance
and profession, which had disappointed Honor, struck the
clergyman as evidences both of sincerity and evenness of
development, proving the sterling reality of what had been
attained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not taking, but trusty,&rsquo; judged the vicar.</p>
<p>But the lad was an angry lover.&nbsp; How tantalizing to be
offered a fourth curate, with a long purse, only to find St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s serving as an outlet for a lover&rsquo;s quarrel,
and the youth restless and restive ere the end of his
diaconate!</p>
<p>&lsquo;How savage you are,&rsquo; said his wife; &lsquo;as if
the parish would be hurt by his help or his presence.&nbsp; If he
goes, let him go&mdash;some other help will come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And don&rsquo;t deprive him of the advantage of a good
master,&rsquo; said Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This wretched cure is not worth flattery,&rsquo; he
said, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Mrs. Parsons, &lsquo;how often have I
heard you rejoice that you started here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Under Mr. Charlecote&mdash;yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are the depository of his traditions,&rsquo; said
Honor, &lsquo;hand them on to Robert.&nbsp; I wish nothing better
for Owen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons wished something better for himself, and averted a
reply, by speaking of Robert as accepted.</p>
<p><!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>Robert&rsquo;s next request was to be made useful in
the parish, while preparing for his ordination in the autumn
Ember week; and though there were demurs as to unnecessarily
anticipating the strain on health and strength, he obtained his
wish in mercy to a state only to be alleviated by the realities
of labour.</p>
<p>So few difficulties were started by his family, that Honora
suspected that Mr. Fulmort, always chiefly occupied by what was
immediately before him, hardly realized that by taking an
assistant curacy at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s, his son became one of
the pastors of Whittington-streets, great and little,
Richard-courts, Cicely-row, Alice-lane, Cat-alley, and
Turnagain-corner.&nbsp; Scarcely, however, was this settled, when
a despatch arrived from Dublin, headed, &lsquo;The Fast Fly
Fishers; or the modern St. Kevin,&rsquo; containing in Ingoldsby
legend-like rhymes the entire narration of the Glendalough
predicament of the &lsquo;Fast and Fair,&rsquo; and concluding
with a piece of prose, by the same author, assuring his Sweet
Honey, that the poem, though strange, was true, that he had just
seen the angelic anglers on board the steamer, and it would not
be for lack of good advice on his part, if Lucy did not present
herself at Woolstone-lane, to partake of the dish called humble
pie, on the derivation whereof antiquaries were divided.</p>
<p>Half amused, half vexed by his levity, and wholly relieved and
hopeful, Honora could not help showing Owen&rsquo;s performance
to Ph&oelig;be for the sake of its cleverness; but she found the
child too young and simple to enter into it, for the whole effect
was an entreaty that Robert might not see it, only hear the
facts.</p>
<p>Rather annoyed by this want of appreciation of Owen&rsquo;s
wit, Honora saw, nevertheless, that Ph&oelig;be had come to a
right conclusion.&nbsp; The breach was not likely to be
diminished by finding that the wilful girl had exposed herself to
ridicule, and the Fulmort nature had so little sense of the
ludicrous, that this good-natured brotherly satire would be taken
for mere derision.</p>
<p>So Honor left it to Ph&oelig;be to give her own version, only
wishing that the catastrophe had come to his knowledge before his
arrangements had been made with Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had some difficulty in telling her story.&nbsp;
Robert at first silenced her peremptorily, but after ten minutes
relented, and said, moodily, &lsquo;Well, let me
hear!&rsquo;&nbsp; He listened without relaxing a muscle of his
rigid countenance; and when Ph&oelig;be ended by saying that Miss
Charlecote had ordered Lucy&rsquo;s room to be prepared, thinking
that she might present herself at any moment, he said,
&lsquo;Take care that you warn me when she comes.&nbsp; I shall
leave town that minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert, Robert, if she come home grieved and knowing
better&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not see her!&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
made her taking this journey the test!&nbsp; The result is
nothing to me!&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, I trust to you that no intended
good-nature of Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s should bring us
together.&nbsp; Promise me.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Ph&oelig;be could do nothing but promise, and not
another sentence could she obtain from her brother, indeed his
face looked so formidable in its sternness, that she would have
been a bold maiden to have tried.</p>
<p>Honora augured truly, that not only was his stern nature
deeply offended, but that he was quite as much in dread of coming
under the power of Lucy&rsquo;s fascinations, as Cilla had ever
been of his strength.&nbsp; Such mutual aversion was really a
token of the force of influence upon each, and Honor assured
Ph&oelig;be that all would come right.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let her only
come home and be good, and you will see, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; She
will not be the worse for an alarm, nor even for waiting till
after his two years at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reception of the travellers at Castle Blanch was certainly
not mortifying by creating any excitement.&nbsp; Charles
Charteris said his worst in the words, &lsquo;One week!&rsquo;
and his wife was glad to have some one to write her notes.</p>
<p>This indifference fretted Lucy.&nbsp; She found herself
loathing the perfumy rooms, the sleepy voice, and hardly able to
sit still in her restless impatience of Lolly&rsquo;s platitudes
and Charles&rsquo;s <i>insouciance</i>, while Rashe could never
be liked again.&nbsp; Even a lecture from Honor Charlecote would
have been infinitely preferable, and one grim look of
Robert&rsquo;s would be bliss!</p>
<p>No one knew whether Miss Charlecote were still in town, nor
whether Augusta Fulmort were to be married in England or abroad;
and as to Miss Murrell, Lolly languidly wondered what it was that
she had heard.</p>
<p>Hungering for some one whom she could trust, Lucilla took an
early breakfast in her own room, and walked to Wrapworth, hoping
to catch the curate lingering over his coffee and letters.&nbsp;
From a distance, however, she espied his form disappearing in the
school-porch, and approaching, heard his voice reading prayers,
and the children&rsquo;s chanted response.&nbsp; Coming to the
oriel, she looked in.&nbsp; There were the rows of shiny heads,
fair, brown, and black; there were the long sable back and
chopped-hay locks of the curate; but where a queen-like figure
had of old been wont to preside, she beheld a tallow face, with
sandy hair under the most precise of net caps, and a straight
thread-paper shape in scanty gray stuff and white apron.</p>
<p>Dizzy with wrathful consternation, Cilla threw herself on one
of the seats of the porch, shaking her foot, and biting her lip,
frantic to know the truth, yet too much incensed to enter, even
when the hum of united voices ceased, the rushing sound of rising
was over, and measured footsteps pattered to the classes, where
the manly interrogations sounded alternately with the shrill
little answers.</p>
<p>Clump, clump, came the heavy feet of a laggard, her head bent
over her book, her thick lips vainly conning the unlearned task,
unaware of the presence of the young lady, till Lucilla touched
her, saying, &lsquo;What, Martha, a ten o&rsquo;clock
scholar?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>She gave a little cry, opened her staring eyes, and
dropped a curtsey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom have you here for mistress?&rsquo; asked
Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, governess is runned
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied the girl, developing
powers of volubility such as scholastic relations with her had
left unsuspected.&nbsp; &lsquo;She ran away last Saturday was a
week, and there was nobody to open the school when we came to it
a Sunday morning; and we had holidays all last week, ma&rsquo;am;
and mother was terrified <a name="citation225"></a><a
href="#footnote225" class="citation">[225]</a> out of her life;
and father, he said he wouldn&rsquo;t have me never go for to do
no such thing, and that he didn&rsquo;t want no fine ladies, as
was always spiting of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every one will seem to spite you, if you keep no better
hours,&rsquo; said Lucy, little edified by Martha&rsquo;s
virtuous indignation.</p>
<p>The girl had scarcely entered the school before the clergyman
stood on the threshold, and was seized by both hands, with the
words, &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Prendergast, what is this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You here, Cilla?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp;
What has brought you back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you not heard?&nbsp; A sprain of Ratia&rsquo;s, and
other things.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I knew you would be sadly grieved!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you did frighten her away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never meant it.&nbsp; I tried to act for the
best.&nbsp; She was spoken to, by myself and others, but nobody
could make any impression, and we could only give her notice to
go at the harvest holidays.&nbsp; She took it with her usual
grand air&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which is really misery and despair.&nbsp; Oh, why did I
go?&nbsp; Go on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote to the mother, advising her, if possible, to
come and be with the girl till the holidays.&nbsp; That was on
Thursday week, and the old woman promised to come on the
Monday&mdash;wrote a very proper letter, allowing for the
Methodistical phrases&mdash;but on the Saturday it was observed
that the house was not opened, and on Sunday morning I got a
note&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll come in I&rsquo;ll show it to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He presently discovered it among multitudinous other papers on
his chimney-piece.&nbsp; Within a lady-like envelope was a thick
satin-paper, queen&rsquo;s-sized note, containing these
words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Reverend
Sir</span>,&mdash;It is with the deepest feelings of regret for
the unsatisfactory appearance of my late conduct that I venture
to address you, but time will enable me to account for all, and I
can at the present moment only entreat you to pardon any
inconvenience I may have occasioned by the precipitancy of my
departure.&nbsp; Credit me, reverend and dear sir, it was only
the law of necessity that could have compelled me to act in a
manner that may appear questionable.&nbsp; Your feeling heart
will <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>excuse my reserve when you are
informed of the whole.&nbsp; In the meantime, I am only permitted
to mention that this morning I became a happy wife.&nbsp; With
heartfelt thanks for all the kindness I have received, I
remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Reverend sir,<br />
&lsquo;Your obedient servant,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Edna</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Not one message to me?&rsquo; exclaimed Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her not having had the impudence is the only redeeming
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not think she would have left no word for
me,&rsquo; said Lucy, who knew she had been kinder than her wont,
and was really wounded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Happy wife!&nbsp; Who can it
be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy wife?&rsquo; repeated the curate.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is miserable fool, most likely, by this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No surname signed!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the
post-mark?&nbsp; Only Charing-cross.&nbsp; Could you find out
nothing, or did you not think it worth while to look?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you take me for, Cilla?&nbsp; I inquired at the
station, but she had not been there, and on the Monday I went to
London and saw the mother, who was in great distress, for she had
had a letter much like mine, only more unsatisfactory, throwing
out absurd hints about grandeur and prosperity&mdash;poor deluded
simpleton!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She distinctly says she is married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but she gives no name nor place.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that worth?&nbsp; After such duplicity as she has
been practising so long, I don&rsquo;t know how to take her
statement.&nbsp; Those people are pleased to talk of a marriage
in the sight of heaven, when they mean the devil&rsquo;s own
work!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; I will not think it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t, my dear.&nbsp; You were very young
and innocent, and thought no harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not young&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
innocent!&rsquo; furiously said Cilly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me
downright all you suspect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not given to suspecting,&rsquo; said the poor
clergyman, half in deprecation, half in reproof; &lsquo;but I am
afraid it is a bad business.&nbsp; If she had married a servant
or any one in her own rank, there would have been no need of
concealing the name, at least from her mother.&nbsp; I feared at
first that it was one of your cousin Charles&rsquo;s friends, but
there seems more reason to suppose that one of the musical people
at your concert at the castle may have thought her voice a good
speculation for the stage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He would marry her to secure her gains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If so, why the secrecy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Jenkins has taught you to make it as bad as
possible,&rsquo; burst out Lucy.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, why was not I at
home?&nbsp; Is it too late to trace her and proclaim her
innocence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was wishing for your help.&nbsp; I went to Mr.
Charteris to ask <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>who the performers were, but he knew
nothing about them, and said you and his sister had managed it
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The director was Derval.&nbsp; He is fairly
respectable, at least I know nothing to the contrary.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make Charlie write.&nbsp; There was an Italian, with a
black beard and a bass voice, whom we have had several
times.&nbsp; I saw him looking at her.&nbsp; Just tell me what
sort of woman is the mother.&nbsp; She lets lodgings, does not
she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, in Little Whittington-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&nbsp; I trust she is no friend of Honor
Charlecote&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of her beat, I should think.&nbsp; She
dissents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a blessing!&nbsp; I beg your pardon, but if
anything could be an aggravation, it would be Honor
Charlecote&rsquo;s moralities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you were not aware of the dissent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are going to set that down as more deceit, as
if it were the poor thing&rsquo;s business to denounce her
mother.&nbsp; Now, to show you that I can be sure that Edna was
brought up to the Church, I will tell you her antecedents.&nbsp;
Her father was Sir Thomas Deane&rsquo;s butler; they lived in the
village, and she was very much in the nursery with the Miss
Deanes&mdash;had some lessons from the governess.&nbsp; There was
some notion of making her a nursery governess, but Sir Thomas
died, the ladies went abroad, taking her father with them; Edna
was sent to a training school, and the mother went to live in the
City with a relation who let lodgings, and who has since died,
leaving the concern to Mrs. Murrell, whose husband was killed by
an upset of the carriage on the Alps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard all that, and plenty besides!&nbsp; Poor woman,
she was in such distress that one could not but let her pour it
all out, but I declare the din rang in my ears the whole night
after.&nbsp; A very nice, respectable-looking body she was, with
jet-black eyes like diamonds, and a rosy, countrified complexion,
quite a treat to see in that grimy place, her widow&rsquo;s cap
as white as snow, but oh, such a tongue!&nbsp; She would give me
all her spiritual experiences&mdash;how she was converted by an
awakening minister in Cat-alley, and yet had a great respect for
such ministers of the Church as fed their flocks with sincere
milk, mixed up with the biography of all the shopmen and clerks
who ever lodged there, and to whom she acted as a
mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not their fault that she did not act as a
mother-in-law.&nbsp; Edna has told me of the unpleasantness of
being at home on account of the young men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly!&nbsp; I was spared none of the chances she
might have had, but the only thing worthy of note was about a
cashier who surreptitiously brought a friend from the
&ldquo;hopera,&rdquo; to overhear her singing hymns on the Sunday
evening, and thus led to an offer on his part to have her brought
out on the stage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! could that have come to anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; Mrs. Murrell&rsquo;s suspicions took that
direction, and we hunted down the cashier and the friend, but
they were quite <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>exonerated.&nbsp; It only proves
that her voice has an unfortunate value.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she be gone off with the Italian bass, I can&rsquo;t
say I think it a fatal sign that she was slow to present him to
her domestic Mause Headrigg, who no doubt would deliberately
prefer the boards of her coffin to the boards of the
theatre.&nbsp; Well, come along&mdash;we will get a letter from
Charles, and rescue her&mdash;I mean, clear her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you look into school, and see how we go
on?&nbsp; The women complained so much of having their children
on their hands, though I am sure they had sent them to school
seldom enough of late, that I got this young woman from Mrs.
Stuart&rsquo;s asylum till the holidays.&nbsp; I think we shall
let her stay on, she has a good deal of method, and all seem
pleased with the change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have your wish of a fright.&nbsp; No, I thank
you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so glad as the rest of you to get rid of
refinement and superiority.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, and more touched by silence than reply,
she hastily said, &lsquo;Never mind!&nbsp; I dare say she may do
better for the children, but you know, I, who am hard of caring
for any one, did care for poor Edna, and I can&rsquo;t stand
p&aelig;ans over your new broom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast gave a smile such as was only evoked by his
late rector&rsquo;s little daughter, and answered, &lsquo;No one
can be more concerned than I.&nbsp; She was not in her place
here, that was certain, and I ought to have minded that she was
not thrust into temptation.&nbsp; I shall remember it with shame
to my dying day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which means to say that so should I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you did not know so much of the evils of the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you before, Mr. Pendy, that I am twenty times
more sophisticated than you are.&nbsp; You talk of knowing the
world!&nbsp; I wish I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of
everybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And on the way home she described her expedition, and had the
pleasure of the curate&rsquo;s sympathy, if not his entire
approval.&nbsp; Perhaps there was no other being whom she so
thoroughly treated as a friend, actually like a woman friend,
chiefly because he thoroughly believed in her, and was very blind
to her faults.&nbsp; Robert would have given worlds to have found
her <i>once</i> what Mr. Prendergast found her <i>always</i>.</p>
<p>She left him to wait in the drawing-room, while she went on
her mission, but presently rushed back in a fury.&nbsp; Nobody
cared a straw for the catastrophe.&nbsp; Lolly begged her not to
be so excited about a trifle, it made her quite nervous; and the
others laughed at her; Rashe pretended to think it a fine chance
to have changed &lsquo;the life of an early Christian&rsquo; for
the triumphs of the stage; and Charles scouted the idea of
writing to the man&rsquo;s employer.&nbsp; &lsquo;He call Derval
to account for all the tricks of his fiddlers and singers?&nbsp;
Much obliged!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast decided on going to town by the next train, to
make inquiries of Derval himself, without further loss of time,
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>and Cilly declared that she would go with him and force
the conceited professor to attend; but the curate, who had never
found any difficulty in enforcing his own dignity, and thought it
no business for a young lady, declined her company, unless, he
said, she were to spend the day with Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to go to her for good and
all.&nbsp; Let her fall upon me for all and sundry.&nbsp; It will
do me good to hear a decent woman speak again! besides, poor old
soul, she will be so highly gratified, that she will be quite
meek&rsquo; (and so will some one else, quoth the perverse little
heart); &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put up a few things, and not delay
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is very sudden!&rsquo; said the curate, wishing to
keep the peace between her and her friends, and not willing that
his sunbeam should fleet &lsquo;so like the Borealis
race!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Will it not annoy your
cousins?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They ought to be annoyed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are you certain that you would find Miss Charlecote
in town?&nbsp; I thought her stay was to be short.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m certain of nothing, but that every place is
detestable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would you do if you did not find her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on to Euston-square.&nbsp; Do you think I
don&rsquo;t know my way to Hiltonbury, or that I should not get
welcome enough&mdash;ay, and too much&mdash;there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if you are so uncertain of her movements, do you
not think you had better let me learn them before you
start?&nbsp; She might not even be gone home, and you would not
like to come back here again; if&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a dog that has been out hunting,&rsquo; said
Lucilla, who could bear opposition from this quarter as from no
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t take the responsibility,
that&rsquo;s the fact.&nbsp; Well, you may go and reconnoitre, if
you will; but mind, if you say one word of what brings you to
town, I shall never go near the Holt at all.&nbsp; To
hear&mdash;whenever the Raymonds, or any other of the godly
school-keeping sort come to dinner&mdash;of the direful effects
of certificated schoolmistresses, would drive me to such
distraction that I cannot answer for the consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it is not a fact to proclaim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but if you run against Mr. Parsons, you&rsquo;ll
never abstain from telling him of his stray lamb, nor from
condoling with him upon the wolf in Cat-alley.&nbsp; Now
there&rsquo;s a fair hope of his having more on his hands than to
get his fingers scratched by meddling with the cats, and so that
this may remain unknown.&nbsp; So consider yourself sworn to
secrecy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast promised.&nbsp; The good man was a bit of a
gossip, so perhaps her precaution was not thrown away, for he
could hardly have helped seeking the sympathy of a brother
pastor, especially of him to whose fold the wanderer primarily
belonged.&nbsp; Nor did Lucy feel certain of not telling the
whole herself in some unguarded moment of confidence.&nbsp; All
she cared for was, that the story should not transpire through
some other <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>source, and be brandished over her
head as an illustration of all the maxims that she had so often
spurned.&nbsp; She ran after Mr. Prendergast after he had taken
leave, to warn him against calling in Woolstone-lane, and desired
him instead to go to Masters&rsquo;s shop, where it was sure to
be known whether Miss Charlecote were in town or not.</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast secretly did grateful honour to the
consideration that would not let him plod all the weary way into
the City.&nbsp; Little did he guess that it was one part mistrust
of his silence, and three parts reviving pride, which forbade
that Honora should know that he had received any such
commission.</p>
<p>The day was spent in pleasant anticipations of the gratitude
and satisfaction that would be excited by her magnanimous return,
and her pardon to Honor and to Robert for having been in the
right.&nbsp; She knew she could own it so graciously that Robert
would be overpowered with compunction, and for ever beholden to
her; and now that the Charterises were so unmitigatedly hateful,
it was time to lay herself out for goodness, and fling him the
rein, with only now and then a jerk to remind him that she was a
free agent.</p>
<p>A long-talked-of journey on the Continent was to come to pass
as soon as Horatia&rsquo;s strain was well.&nbsp; In spite of
wealth and splendour, Elo&iuml;sa had found herself disappointed
in the step that she had hoped her marriage would give her into
the most <i>&eacute;lite</i> circles.&nbsp; Languid and indolent
as her mind was, she could not but perceive that where Ratia was
intimate and at ease, she continued on terms of form and
ceremony, and her husband felt more keenly that the society in
his house was not what it had been in his mother&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; They both became restless, and Lolly, who had already
lived much abroad, dreaded the dulness of an English winter in
the country; while Charles knew that he had already spent more
than he liked to recollect, and that the only means of keeping
her contented at Castle Blanch, would be to continue most ruinous
expenses.</p>
<p>With all these secret motives, the tour was projected as a
scheme of amusement, and the details were discussed between
Charles and Rashe with great animation, making the soberness of
Hiltonbury appear both tedious and sombre, though all the time
Lucy felt that there she should again meet that which her heart
both feared and yearned for, and without which these pleasures
would be but shadows of enjoyment.&nbsp; Yet that they were not
including her in their party, gave her a sense of angry neglect
and impatience.&nbsp; She wanted to reject their invitation
indignantly, and make a merit of the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The after-dinner discussion was in full progress when she was
called out to speak to Mr. Prendergast.&nbsp; Heated, wearied,
and choking with dust, he would not come beyond the hall, but
before going home he had walked all this distance to tell her the
result of his expedition.&nbsp; Derval had not been uncivil, but
evidently thought the suspicion an affront to his <i>corps</i>,
which <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>at present was dispersed by the end
of the season.&nbsp; The Italian bass was a married man, and had
returned to his own country.&nbsp; The clue had failed.&nbsp; The
poor leaf must be left to drift upon unknown winds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said the curate, by way of compensation,
&lsquo;at Masters&rsquo;s I found Miss Charlecote herself, and
gave your message.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I gave no message.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, because you would not send me up into the City;
but I told her all you would have had me say, and how nearly you
had come up with me, only I would not let you, for fear she
should have left town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cilla&rsquo;s face did not conceal her annoyance, but not
understanding her in the least, he continued, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
sure no one could speak more kindly or considerately than she
did.&nbsp; Her eyes filled with tears, and she must be heartily
fond of you at the bottom, though maybe rather injudicious and
strict; but after what I told her, you need have no
fears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever know me have any?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well! you don&rsquo;t like the word; but at any rate
she thinks you behaved with great spirit and discretion under the
circumstances, and quite overlooks any little imprudence.&nbsp;
She hopes to see you the day after to-morrow, and will write and
tell you so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps no intentional slander ever gave the object greater
annoyance than Cilly experienced on learning that the good curate
had, in the innocence of his heart, represented her as in a state
of proper feeling, and interceded for her; and it was all the
worse because it was impossible to her to damp his kind
satisfaction, otherwise than by a brief &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo;
the tone of which he did not comprehend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was she alone?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you the young lady was with her,
and the brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert Fulmort!&rsquo; and Cilla&rsquo;s heart sank at
finding that it could not have been he who had been with
Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, the young fellow that slept at my house.&nbsp; He
has taken a curacy at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he tell you so?&rsquo; with an ill-concealed start
of consternation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he; lads have strange manners.&nbsp; I should have
thought after the terms we were upon here, he need not have been
quite so much absorbed in his book as never to speak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has plenty in him instead of manners,&rsquo; said
Lucilla; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll take him in hand for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Lucilla&rsquo;s instinct of defence had spoken up for
Robert, she felt hurt at his treatment of her old friend, and
could only excuse it by a strong fit of conscious
moodiness.&nbsp; His taking the curacy was only explicable, she
thought, as a mode of showing his displeasure with herself, since
he could not ask her to marry into Whittingtonia; but &lsquo;That
must be <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>all nonsense,&rsquo; thought she;
&lsquo;I will soon have him down off his high horse, and Mr.
Parsons will never keep him to his engagement&mdash;silly fellow
to have made it&mdash;or if he does, I shall only have the longer
to plague him.&nbsp; It will do him good.&nbsp; Let me see! he
will come down to-morrow with Honora&rsquo;s note.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll put on my lilac muslin with the innocent little frill,
and do my hair under his favourite net, and look like such a
horrid little meek ringdove that he will be perfectly disgusted
with himself for having ever taken me for a fishing eagle.&nbsp;
He will be abject, and I&rsquo;ll be generous, and not give
another peck till it has grown intolerably stupid to go on being
good, or till he presumes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the first time for many days, Lucilla awoke with the
impression that something pleasant was about to befall her, and
her wild heart was in a state of glad flutter as she donned the
quiet dress, and found that the subdued colouring and graver
style rendered her more softly lovely than she had ever seen
herself.</p>
<p>The letters were on the breakfast-table when she came down,
the earliest as usual, and one was from Honor Charlecote, the
first sight striking her with vexation, as discomfiting her hopes
that it would come by a welcome bearer.&nbsp; Yet that might be
no reason why he should not yet run down.</p>
<p>She tore it open.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest
Lucy</span>,&mdash;Until I met Mr. Prendergast yesterday, I was
not sure that you had actually returned, or I would not have
delayed an hour in assuring you, if you could doubt it, that my
pardon is ever ready for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Many thanks,&rsquo; was the muttered comment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh that poor, dear, stupid man! would that I had stopped
his mouth!&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never doubted that your refinement and sense of
propriety would be revolted at the consequences of what I always
saw to be mere thoughtlessness&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Dearly beloved of an old maid is, I told you
so!&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;but I am delighted to hear that my dear child
showed so much true delicacy and dignity in her trying
predicament&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Delighted to find her dear child not absolutely lost
to decorum!&nbsp; Thanks again.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;and I console myself for the pain it has given
by the trust that experience has proved a better teacher than
precept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Where did she find that grand sentence?&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that good may result from past evil and present
suffering, and that you may have learnt to distrust those who
would lead you to disregard the dictates of your own better
sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Meaning her own self!&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have said all this by letter that we may cast aside
all that is painful when we meet, and only to feel that I am
welcoming my child, doubly dear, because she comes owning her
error.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>(&lsquo;I dare say!&nbsp; We like to be magnanimous,
don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Prendergast, I could beat
you!&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our first kiss shall seal your pardon, dearest, and not
a word shall pass to remind you of this distressing page in your
history.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Distressing!&nbsp; Excellent fun it was.&nbsp; I shall
make her hear my diary, if I persuade myself to encounter this
intolerable kiss of peace.&nbsp; It will be a mercy if I
don&rsquo;t serve her as the thief in the fable did his mother
when he was going to be hanged.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will meet you at the station by any train on Saturday
that you like to appoint, and early next week we will go down to
what I am sure you have felt is your only true home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Have I?&nbsp; Oh! she has heard of their journey, and
thinks this my only alternative.&nbsp; As if I could not go with
them if I chose&mdash;I wish they would ask me, though.&nbsp;
They shall!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be driven up to the Holt as my
last resource, and live there under a system of mild browbeating,
because I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; No, no! Robin shall find it
takes a vast deal of persuasion to bend me to swallow so much
pardon in milk and water.&nbsp; I wonder if there&rsquo;s time to
change the spooney simplicity, and come out in something spicy,
with a dash of the Bloomer.&nbsp; But, maybe, there&rsquo;s some
news of him in the other sheet, now she has delivered her
conscience of her rigmarole.&nbsp; Oh! here it
is&mdash;&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be will go home with us, as she is, according
to the family system, not summoned to her sister&rsquo;s
wedding.&nbsp; Robert leaves London on Saturday morning, to fetch
his books, &amp;c., from Oxford, Mr. Parsons having consented to
give him a title for Holy Orders, and to let him assist in the
parish until the next Ember week.&nbsp; I think, dear girl, that
it should not be concealed from you that this step was taken as
soon as he heard that you had actually sailed for Ireland, and
that he does not intend to return until we are in the
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Does he not?&nbsp; Another act of coercion!&nbsp; I
suppose you put him up to this, madam, as a pleasing course of
discipline.&nbsp; You think you have the whip-hand of me, do
you?&nbsp; Pooh!&nbsp; See if he&rsquo;ll stay at
Oxford!&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel for the grief I&rsquo;m
inflicting&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Oh, so you complacently think, &ldquo;now I have made
her sorry!&rdquo;&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;but I believe uncertainty, waiting, and heart
sickness would cost you far more.&nbsp; Trust me, as one who has
felt it, that it is far better to feel oneself unworthy than to
learn to doubt or distrust the worthiness or constancy of
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;My father to wit!&nbsp; A pretty thing to say to his
daughter!&nbsp; What right has she to be pining and complaining
after him?&nbsp; He, the unworthy one?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never
forgive that conceited inference!&nbsp; Just because he could not
stand sentiment!&nbsp; Master Robert gone!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t I
soon have him repenting of his outbreak?&rsquo;)</p>
<p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&lsquo;I have no doubt that his feelings are unchanged,
and that he is solely influenced by principle.&nbsp; He is
evidently exceedingly unhappy under all his
reserve&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;He shall be more so, till he behaves himself, and
comes back humble!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no notion of his flying out
in this way.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;and though I have not exchanged a word with him
on the subject, I am certain that his good opinion will be
retrieved, with infinite joy to himself, as soon as you make it
possible for his judgment to be satisfied with your conduct and
sentiments.&nbsp; Grieved as I am, it is with a hopeful sorrow,
for I am sure that nothing is wanting on your part but that
consistency and sobriety of behaviour of which you have newly
learnt the necessity on other grounds.&nbsp; The Parsonses have
gone to their own house, so you will not find any one here but
two who will feel for you in silence, and we shall soon be in the
quiet of the Holt, where you shall have all that can give you
peace or comfort from your ever-loving
old&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H.

</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Feel for me!&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you wish
you may get it?&nbsp; Teach the catechism and feed caterpillars
till such time as it pleases Mrs. Honor to write up and say
&ldquo;the specimen is tame&rdquo;?&nbsp; How nice!&nbsp; No,
no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be frightened into their lording it over
me!&nbsp; I know a better way!&nbsp; Let Mr. Robert find out how
little I care, and get himself heartily sick of St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s, till it is &ldquo;turn again Whittington
indeed!&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor fellow, I hate it, but he must be cured
of his airs, and have a good fright.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t they
ask me to go to Paris with them?&nbsp; Where can I go, if they
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; To Mary Cranford&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Stupid place,
but I <i>will</i> show that I&rsquo;m not so hard up as to have
no place but the Holt to go to!&nbsp; If it were only possible to
stay with Mr. Prendergast, it would be best of all!&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t I tell him to catch a chaperon for me?&nbsp; Then he
would think Honor a regular dragon, which would be a shame, for
it was nobody&rsquo;s fault but his!&nbsp; I shall tell him
I&rsquo;m like the Christian religion, for which people are
always making apologies that it doesn&rsquo;t want!&nbsp; Two
years!&nbsp; Patience!&nbsp; It will be very good for Robin, and
four-and-twenty is quite soon enough to bite off one&rsquo;s
wings, and found an ant-hill.&nbsp; As to being bullied into
being kissed, pitied, pardoned, and trained by Honor, I&rsquo;ll
never sink so low!&nbsp; No, at <i>no</i> price.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Prendergast!&nbsp; Did ever a more innocent
mischief-maker exist?</p>
<p>Poor Honora!&nbsp; Little did she guess that the letter
written in such love, such sympathy, such longing hope, would
only excite fierce rebellion.</p>
<p>Yet it was at the words of Moses that the king&rsquo;s heart
was hardened; and what was the end?&nbsp; He was taken at his
word.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou shalt see my face no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To be asked to join the party on their tour had become
Lucilla&rsquo;s prime desire, if only that she might not feel
neglected, <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>or driven back to Hiltonbury by
absolute necessity; and when the husband and wife came down, the
wish was uppermost in her mind.</p>
<p>Elo&iuml;sa remarked on her quiet style of dress, and observed
that it would be quite the thing in Paris, where people were so
much less <i>outr&eacute;</i> than here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have nothing to do with Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! surely you go with us!&rsquo; said Elo&iuml;sa;
&lsquo;I like to take you out, because you are in so different a
style of beauty, and you talk and save one trouble!&nbsp; Will
not she go, Charles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, Lolly wants you for effect!&rsquo; he said,
sneeringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you are always welcome, Cilly; we
are woefully slow when you ain&rsquo;t there to keep us going,
and I should like to show you a thing or two.&nbsp; I only did
not ask you, because I thought you had not hit it off with Rashe,
or have you made it up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Rashe and I understand each other,&rsquo; said
Cilly, secure that though she would never treat Rashe with her
former confidence, yet as long as they travelled <i>en grand
seigneur</i>, there was no fear of collisions of temper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rashe is a good creature,&rsquo; said Lolly, &lsquo;but
she is so fast and so eccentric that I like to have you, Cilly;
you look so much younger, and more ladylike.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One thing more,&rsquo; said Charles, in his character
of head of the family; &lsquo;shouldn&rsquo;t you look up Miss
Charlecote, Cilly?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Owen straining the leash
pretty hard, and you must look about you, that she does not take
up with these new pets of hers and cheat you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Fulmorts?&nbsp; Stuff!&nbsp; They have more already
than they know what to do with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very reason she will leave them the more.&nbsp; I
declare, Cilly,&rsquo; he added, half in jest, half in earnest,
&lsquo;the only security for you and Owen is in a double
marriage.&nbsp; Perhaps she projects it.&nbsp; You fire up as if
she had!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she had, do you think that I should go back?&rsquo;
said Cilly, trying to answer lightly, though her cheeks were in a
flame.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, I am not going to let slip a chance
of Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stopped short, dismayed at having committed herself, and
Horatia coming down, was told by acclamation that Cilly was
going.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course she is,&rsquo; said forgiving and forgetting
Rashe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Little Cilly left behind, to serve for food
to the Rouge Dragon?&nbsp; No, no! I should have no fun in life
without her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rashe forgot the past far more easily that Cilla could ever
do.&nbsp; There was a certain guilty delight in
writing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Honor</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your letter, and intended
kindnesses.&nbsp; The scene must, however, be deferred, as my
cousins mean to winter at Paris, and I can&rsquo;t resist the
chance of hooking a Marshal, or a Prince or two.&nbsp;
Rashe&rsquo;s strain was a great sell but we had capital fun, and
shall hope for more success <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>another
season.&nbsp; I would send you my diary if it were written out
fair.&nbsp; We go so soon that I can&rsquo;t run up to London, so
I hope no one will be disturbed on my account.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your
affectionate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Cilly</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No need to say how often Lucilla would have liked to have
recalled that note for addition or diminution, how many
misgivings she suffered on her peculiar mode of catching Robins,
how frequent were her disgusts with her cousin, and how often she
felt like a captive&mdash;the captive of her own self-will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; said Horatia to Lolly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was mortally afraid she would stay at home to fall a
prey to the incipient parson, but now he is choked off, and
Calthorp is really in earnest, we shall have the dear little
morsel doing well yet.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<blockquote><p>O ye, who never knew the joys<br />
Of friendship, satisfied with noise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fandango, ball, and rout,<br />
Blush, when I tell you how a bird<br />
A prison, with a friend, preferred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To liberty without.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowper</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had Lucilla Sandbrook realized the effect of her note, she
would never have dashed it off; but, like all heedless people,
pain out of her immediate ken was nothing to her.</p>
<p>After the loving hopes raised by the curate&rsquo;s report,
and after her own tender and forgiving letter, Honor was pierced
to the quick by the scornful levity of those few lines.&nbsp; Of
the ingratitude to herself she thought but little in comparison
with the heartless contempt towards Robert, and the miserable
light-mindedness that it manifested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor, poor child!&rsquo; was all she said, as she
saw Ph&oelig;be looking with terror at her countenance;
&lsquo;yes, there is an end of it.&nbsp; Let Robert never vex
himself about her again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be took up the note, read it over and over again, and
then said low and gravely, &lsquo;It is very cruel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child, she was born to the Charteris nature, and
cannot help it!&nbsp; Like seeks like, and with Paris before her,
she can see and feel nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be vaguely suspected that there might be a shadow of
injustice in this conclusion.&nbsp; She knew that Miss Charlecote
imagined Lucilla to be more frivolous than was the case, and
surmised that there was more offended pride than mere levity in
the letter.&nbsp; Insight into character is a natural, not an
acquired endowment; and many of poor Honor&rsquo;s troubles had
been caused by her deficiency in that which was intuitive to
Ph&oelig;be, though far from consciously.&nbsp; That perception
made her stand thoughtful, wondering whether what the letter <!--
page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>betrayed were folly or temper, and whether, like Miss
Charlecote, she ought altogether to quench her indignation in
contemptuous pity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, my dear,&rsquo; said Honor, recovering herself,
after having sat with ashy face and clasped hands for many
moments.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will not bear to be spoken or thought
of.&nbsp; Let us go to something else.&nbsp; Only, Ph&oelig;be,
my child, do not leave her out of your prayers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be clung about her neck, kissed and fondled her, and
felt her cheeks wet with tears, in the passionate tenderness of
the returning caress.</p>
<p>The resolve was kept of not going back to the subject, but
Honora went about all day with a soft, tardy step, and subdued
voice, like one who has stood beside a death-bed.</p>
<p>When Ph&oelig;be heard those stricken tones striving to be
cheerful, she could not find pardon for the wrong that had not
been done to herself.&nbsp; She dreaded telling Robert that no
one was coming whom he need avoid, though without dwelling on the
tone of the refusal.&nbsp; To her surprise, he heard her short,
matter-of-fact communication without any token of anger or of
grief, made no remark, and if he changed countenance at all, it
was to put on an air of gloomy satisfaction, as though another
weight even in the most undesirable scale were preferable to any
remnant of balancing, and compunction for possible injustice were
removed.</p>
<p>Could Lucilla but have seen that face, she would have doubted
of her means of reducing him to obedience.</p>
<p>The course he had adopted might indeed be the more excellent
way in the end, but at present even his self-devotion was not in
such a spirit as to afford much consolation to Honor.&nbsp; If
good were to arise out of sorrow, the painful seed-time was not
yet over.&nbsp; His looks were stern even to harshness, and his
unhappiness seemed disposed to vent itself in doing his work
after his own fashion, brooking no interference.</p>
<p>He had taken a lodging over a baker&rsquo;s shop at Turnagain
Corner.&nbsp; Honor thought it fair for the locality, and knew
something of the people, but to Ph&oelig;be it was horror and
dismay.&nbsp; The two small rooms, the painted cupboard, the cut
paper in the grate, the pictures in yellow gauze, with the flies
walking about on them, the round mirror, the pattern of the
carpet, and the close, narrow street, struck her as absolutely
shocking, and she came to Miss Charlecote with tears in her eyes,
to entreat her to remonstrate, and tell Robin it was his duty to
live like a gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Honor, rather shocked at a speech
so like the ordinary Fulmort mind, &lsquo;I have no fears of
Robert not living like a gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know&mdash;not in the real sense,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, blushing; &lsquo;but surely he ought not to live in
this dismal poky place, with such mean furniture, when he can
afford better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid the parish affords few better lodgings,
Ph&oelig;be, <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>and it is his duty to live where his
work lies.&nbsp; You appreciated his self-denial, I
thought?&nbsp; Do you not like him to make a
sacrifice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, her mind taking
little pleasure in those acts of self-devotion that were the
delight of her friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it be his duty, it cannot
be helped, but I cannot be happy at leaving him to be
uncomfortable&mdash;perhaps ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Coming down from the romance of martyrdom which had made her
expect Ph&oelig;be to be as willing to see her brother bear
hardships in the London streets, as she had herself been to
dismiss Owen the first to his wigwam, Honor took the more homely
view of arguing on the health and quietness of Turnagain Corner,
the excellence of the landlady, and the fact that her own cockney
eyes had far less unreasonable expectations than those trained to
the luxuries of Beauchamp.&nbsp; But by far the most efficient
solace was an expedition for the purchase of various amenities of
life, on which Ph&oelig;be expended the last of her
father&rsquo;s gift.&nbsp; The next morning was spent in great
secrecy at the lodgings, where Ph&oelig;be was so notable and
joyous in her labours, that Honor drew the conclusion that
housewifery was her true element; and science, art, and
literature only acquired, because they had been made her duties,
reckoning all the more on the charming order that would rule in
Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s parsonage.</p>
<p>All troubles and disappointments had faded from the young
girl&rsquo;s mind, as she gazed round exulting on the sacred
prints on the walls, the delicate statuettes, and well-filled
spill-holder and match-box on the mantelshelf, the solid inkstand
and appurtenances upon the handsome table-cover, the comfortable
easy-chair, and the book-cases, whose contents had been reduced
to order due, and knew that the bedroom bore equal testimony to
her skill; while the good landlady gazed in admiration,
acknowledging that she hardly knew her own rooms, and promising
with all her heart to take care of her lodger.</p>
<p>Alas! when, on the way to the station, Honor and Ph&oelig;be
made an unexpected raid to bring some last improvements, Robert
was detected in the act of undoing their work, and denuding his
room of even its original luxuries.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be spoke not,
but her face showed her discomfiture, and Honora attacked him
openly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never meant you to know it,&rsquo; he said, looking
rather foolish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then to ingratitude you added treachery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not that I do not feel your
kindness&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are determined not to feel it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! only, this is no position for mere
luxuries.&nbsp; My fellow-curates&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will use such conveniences of life as come to them
naturally,&rsquo; said Honor, who had lived long enough to be
afraid of the freaks of asceticism.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hear me,
Robert.&nbsp; You are not wise in thrusting aside all that brings
home to you your little sister&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; You think it
cannot be forgotten, but it is not well to cast away <!-- page
239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>these daily memorials.&nbsp; I know you have much to
make you severe&mdash;nay, morose&mdash;but if you become so, you
will never do your work efficiently.&nbsp; You may repel, but
never invite; frighten, but not soothe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You want me to think my efficiency dependent on
arm-chairs and table-covers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you will be harder to all for living in needless
discomfort, and that you will be gentler to all for constantly
meeting tokens of your sister&rsquo;s affection.&nbsp; Had you
sought these comforts for yourself, the case would be different;
but, Robert, candidly, which of you is the self-pleasing, which
the mortified one, at this moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert could not but look convicted as his eyes fell on the
innocent face, with the tears just kept back by strong effort,
and the struggling smile of pardon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Robin,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, as she saw
his air of vexation; &lsquo;I know you never meant
unkindness.&nbsp; Do as you think right, only pray think of what
Miss Charlecote says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has one thing more to say,&rsquo; added
Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think that throwing aside
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s little services will make you fitter to go
among the little children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, but a reluctant approach to a smile gave
Ph&oelig;be courage to effect her restorations, and her whispered
&lsquo;You will not disturb them?&rsquo; met with an affirmative
satisfactory to herself.</p>
<p>Perhaps he felt as of old, when the lady of the Holt had
struck him for his cruelty to the mouse, or expelled him for his
bad language.&nbsp; The same temper remained, although
self-revenge had become the only outlet.&nbsp; He knew what it
was that he had taken for devoted self-denial.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Robin,&rsquo; were Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s parting
words, as she went back to days of her own long past.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wilful doing right seldom tends to good, above all when it
begins by exaggeration of duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Robert was left with thoughts such as perchance might
render him a more tractable subordinate for Mr. Parsons, instead
of getting into training for the Order of St. Dominic.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had to return less joyfully than she had gone
forth.&nbsp; Her first bright star of anticipation had faded, and
she had partaken deeply of the griefs of the two whom she loved
so well.&nbsp; Not only had she to leave the one to his gloomy
lodgings in the City, and the toil that was to deaden suffering,
but the other must be parted with at the station, to return to
the lonely house, where not even old Ponto would meet
her&mdash;his last hour having, to every one&rsquo;s grief, come
in her absence.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could not bear the thought of that solitary
return, and even at the peril of great disappointment to her
sisters, begged to sleep that first night at the Holt, but Honor
thanked her, and laughed it off: &lsquo;No, no! my dear, I am
used to be alone, and depend upon it, there will be such an
arrear of farm <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>business for me, that I should
hardly have time to speak to you.&nbsp; You need not be uneasy
for me, dear one, there is always relief in having a great deal
to do, and I shall know you are near, to come if I want
you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a great deal in that knowledge,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were of any use&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Ph&oelig;be, this visit has made you my friend
instead of my playfellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s deepening colour showed her intense
gratification.&nbsp; &lsquo;And there are the Sundays,&rsquo;
added Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I trust Miss Fennimore will let you
come to luncheon, and to the second service with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will try very hard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Ph&oelig;be could not help feeling like the canary, who
sees his owner&rsquo;s hand held out to catch him after his
flight, or the pony who marks his groom at the gate of the
paddock.&nbsp; Cage and rein were not grievous, but liberty was
over, and free-will began to sink into submission, as the
chimneys of home came nearer, even though the anticipation of her
sister&rsquo;s happiness grew more and more on her, and
compensated for all.</p>
<p>Shrieks of ecstasy greeted her; she was held as fast as though
her sisters feared to lose her again, and Miss Fennimore showed
absolute warmth of welcome.&nbsp; Foreign tongues were dispensed
with, and it was a festival evening of chatter, and display of
purchases, presents, and commissions.&nbsp; The evidences of
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s industry were approved.&nbsp; Her abstracts
of her reading, her notes of museums and exhibitions, her
drawing, needlework, and new pieces of music, exceeded Miss
Fennimore&rsquo;s hopes, and appalled her sisters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did all that,&rsquo; cried Bertha, profiting by
Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s absence; &lsquo;I hope to goodness she
won&rsquo;t make it a precedent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it very tiresome?&rsquo; asked Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes; but it made me comfortable, as if I had a
backbone for my day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But didn&rsquo;t you want to feel like a
lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I felt otherwise, Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a grown-up lady, like mamma and my
sisters?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O examples!&rsquo; cried Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;No wonder
Maria thinks doing nothing the great thing to grow up for.&nbsp;
But, Ph&oelig;be, how could you be so stupid as to go and do all
this heap?&nbsp; You might as well have stayed at
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fennimore desired me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very reason why I&rsquo;d have read stories, and
made pictures out of them, just to feel myself beyond her
talons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Talents, not talons,&rsquo; said Maria.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Cats have talons, people have talents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes both, sometimes neither,&rsquo; observed
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;No explanation, Ph&oelig;be; what&rsquo;s
the use?&nbsp; I want to know if Owen Sandbrook didn&rsquo;t call
you little Miss Precision?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&lsquo;And you went on when he was there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Generally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! what opportunities are wasted on some people.&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t I have had fun!&nbsp; But of course he saw you
were a poor little not-come-out thing, and never spoke to
you.&nbsp; Oh! if Miss Charlecote would ask me to
London!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And me!&rsquo; chimed in Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what would you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not act like a goose, and bring home dry
abstracts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d make Miss Charlecote take me
everywhere, and quite forget all my science, unless I wanted to
amaze some wonderful genius.&nbsp; Oh dear! won&rsquo;t I make
Augusta look foolish some of these days!&nbsp; She really thinks
that steel attracts lightning!&nbsp; Do you think Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s society will appreciate me,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And me?&rsquo; again asked Maria.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed heartily, but did not like Bertha&rsquo;s
scoffing mirth at Maria&rsquo;s question.&nbsp; Glad as she was
to be at home, her glimpse of the outer world had so enlarged her
perceptions, she could not help remarking the unchildlike
acuteness of the younger girl, and the obtuse comprehension of
the elder; and she feared that she had become discontented and
fault-finding after her visit.&nbsp; Moreover, when Bertha spoke
much English, a certain hesitation occurred in her speech which
was apt to pass unnoticed in her foreign tongues, but which
jarred unpleasantly on her sister&rsquo;s ear, and only increased
when noticed.</p>
<p>At nine, when Ph&oelig;be rose as usual to wish good night,
Miss Fennimore told her that she need not for the future retire
before ten, the hour to which she had of late become
accustomed.&nbsp; It was a great boon, especially as she was
assured that the additional hour should be at her own
disposal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have shown that you can be trusted with your time,
my dear.&nbsp; But not to-night,&rsquo; as Ph&oelig;be was
turning to her desk; &lsquo;remember how long I have suffered a
famine of conversation.&nbsp; What! were you not sensible of your
own value in that respect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you instructed me; I did not know you
conversed with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a difference between one susceptible of
instruction, and anything so flippant and volatile as
Bertha,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
poor Maria!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is so good and kind!&nbsp; If she could only see a
few things, and people, and learn to talk!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence and unobtrusiveness are the only useful lessons
for her, poor girl!&rsquo; then observing Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
bewildered looks, &lsquo;My dear, I was forced to speak to Bertha
because she was growing jealous of Maria&rsquo;s exemptions; but
you, who have been constantly shielding and supplying her
deficiencies, you do not tell me that you were not aware of
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always knew she was not clever,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, her looks of alarmed surprise puzzling Miss
Fennimore, who in all her philosophy had never dreamt of the
unconscious instinct of affection.</p>
<p><!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>&lsquo;I could not have thought it,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thought what?&nbsp; Pray tell me!&nbsp; O what is the
matter with poor Maria?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, my dear, you really had never perceived that poor
Maria is not&mdash;has not the usual amount of
capacity&mdash;that she cannot be treated as otherwise than
deficient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does mamma know it?&rsquo; faintly asked Ph&oelig;be,
tears slowly filling her eyes.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore paused, inwardly rating Mrs. Fulmort&rsquo;s
powers little above those of her daughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not
sure,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;your sister Juliana certainly does,
and in spite of the present pain, I believe it best that your
eyes should be opened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I may take care of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you can do much in developing her faculties, as
well as in sheltering her from being thrust into positions to
which she would be unequal.&nbsp; You do so already.&nbsp; Though
her weakness was apparent to me the first week I was in the
house, yet, owing to your kind guardianship, I never perceived
its extent till you were absent.&nbsp; I could not have imagined
so much tact and vigilance could have been unconscious.&nbsp;
Nay, dear child, it is no cause for tears.&nbsp; Her life may
perhaps be happier than that of many of more complete
intellect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought not to cry,&rsquo; owned Ph&oelig;be, the tears
quietly flowing all the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such people cannot do
wrong in the same way as we can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! Ph&oelig;be, till we come to the infinite, how
shall the finite pronounce what is wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be did not understand, but felt that she was not in
Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s atmosphere, and from the heavenly,
&lsquo;from him to whom little is given, little will be
required,&rsquo; came to the earthly, and said, imploring,
&lsquo;And you will never be hard on her again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust I have not been hard on her.&nbsp; I shall task
her less, and only endeavour to give her habits of quiet
occupation, and make her manners retiring.&nbsp; It was this
relaxation of discipline, together with Bertha&rsquo;s sad habit
of teasing, which was intolerable in your absence, that induced
me to explain to her the state of the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shocked she must have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite as you were.&nbsp; Her first remark was that
it was as if she were next in age to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not old enough to understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The governess shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, when I found
her teasing again, she told me it was a psychological
experiment.&nbsp; Little monkey, she laid hold of some books of
mine, and will never rest till she has come to some conclusion as
to what is wanting in Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too young to feel what it means,&rsquo; repeated
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>She was no great acquisition as a companion, for she neither
spoke nor stirred, so that the governess would have thought her
drowsy, but for the uprightness of the straight back, and <!--
page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>the steady fold of the fingers on the knee.&nbsp; Much
as Miss Fennimore detested the sight of inaction, she respected
the reverie consequent on the blow she had given.&nbsp; It was a
refreshing contrast with Bertha&rsquo;s levity; and she meditated
why her system had made the one sister only accurate and
methodical, while the other seemed to be losing heart in mind,
and becoming hard and shrewd.</p>
<p>There was a fresh element in Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
The native respect for &lsquo;the innocent&rsquo; had sprung up
within her, and her spirit seemed to expand into protecting wings
with which to hover over her sister as a charge peculiarly her
own.&nbsp; Here was the new impulse needed to help her when
subsiding into the monotony and task-work of the schoolroom, and
to occupy her in the stead of the more exciting hopes and fears
that she had partaken in London.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore wisely relaxed her rule over Ph&oelig;be, since
she had shown that liberty was regarded as no motive for
idleness; so though the maiden still scrupulously accomplished a
considerable amount of study, she was allowed to portion it out
as suited her inclination, and was no longer forbidden to
interrupt herself for the sake of her sisters.&nbsp; It was
infinite comfort to be no longer obliged to deafen her ears to
the piteous whine of fretful incapacity, and to witness the
sullen heaviness of faculties overtasked, and temper goaded into
torpor.&nbsp; The fact once faced, the result was relief; Maria
was spared and considered, and Ph&oelig;be found the governess
much kinder, not only to her sister but to herself.&nbsp; Absence
had taught the value of the elder pupil, and friendly terms of
equality were beginning to be established.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s freedom did not include solitary walks,
and on weekdays she seldom saw Miss Charlecote, and then only to
hear natural history, the only moderately safe ground between the
two elder ladies.&nbsp; What was natural science with the one,
was natural history with the other.&nbsp; One went deep in
systems and classifications, and thrust Linn&aelig;us into the
dark ages; the other had observed, collected, and drawn specimens
with the enthusiasm of a Londoner for the country, till she had a
valuable little museum of her own gathering, and was a handbook
for the county curiosities.&nbsp; Star, bird, flower, and insect,
were more than resources, they were the friends of her lonely
life, and awoke many a keen feeling of interest, many an
aspiration of admiring adoration that carried her through her
dreary hours.&nbsp; And though Miss Fennimore thought her science
puerile, her credulity extensive, and her observations
inaccurate, yet she deemed even this ladylike dabbling worthy of
respect as an element of rational pleasure and self-training, and
tried to make Bertha respect it, and abstain from inundating Miss
Charlecote with sesquipedalian names for systems and families,
and, above all, from her principal delight, setting the two
ladies together by the ears, by appealing to her governess to
support <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>her abuse of Linn&aelig;us as an old
&lsquo;dictionary-maker,&rsquo; or for some bold geological
theory that poor Honor was utterly unprepared to swallow.</p>
<p>Bertha was somewhat like the wren, who, rising on the
eagle&rsquo;s head, thought itself the monarch of the birds, but
Honor was by no means convinced that she was not merely
blindfolded on the back of Clavileno Aligero.&nbsp; There was
neither love nor admiration wasted between Honor and Miss
Fennimore, and Ph&oelig;be preferred their being apart.&nbsp; She
enjoyed her Sunday afternoons, short enough, for school must not
be neglected, but Honor shyly acceded to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
entreaty to be allowed to sit by her class and learn by her
teaching.</p>
<p>It was an effort.&nbsp; Honor shrank from exposing her own
misty metaphors, hesitating repetitions, and trivial queries to
so clear a head, trained in distinct reasoning, but it was the
very teaching that the scientific young lady most desired, and
she treasured up every hint, afterwards pursuing the subject with
the resolution to complete the chain of evidence, and asking
questions sometimes rather perplexing to Honor, accustomed as she
was to take everything for granted.&nbsp; Out came authorities,
and Honor found herself examining into the grounds of her own
half-knowledge, gaining fresh ideas, correcting old ones, and
obtaining subjects of interest for many an hour after her young
friend had left her.</p>
<p>While, at home, Ph&oelig;be, after running the gauntlet of
Bertha&rsquo;s diversion at her putting herself to school, when
Scripture lessons were long ago done with, would delight Maria
with long murmuring discourses, often stories about the scholars,
but always conveying some point of religious instruction.&nbsp;
It was a subject to which Maria was less impervious than to any
other; she readily learned to croon over the simple hymns that
Ph&oelig;be brought home, and when once a Scripture story had
found entrance to her mind, would beg to have it marked in her
Bible, and recur to it frequently.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore left her entirely to Ph&oelig;be at these
times, keeping Bertha from molesting her by sarcastic queries, or
by remarks on the sing-song hymns, such as made Ph&oelig;be
sometimes suspect that Maria&rsquo;s love for these topics
rendered them the more distasteful to the younger girl.&nbsp; She
tried to keep them as much sheltered as possible, but was still
sometimes disconcerted by Bertha&rsquo;s mischievous laugh, or by
finding Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s eyes fixed in attention.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s last hour on these evenings was spent in
laying up her new lore in her diligently kept note-book, weighing
it and endeavouring to range it in logical sequence, which she
had been duly trained to consider the test of reasoning.&nbsp; If
she sometimes became bewildered, and detected insufficient
premises for true conclusions, if she could not think allegory or
analogy the evidence it was made at the Sunday-school, and which
Miss Charlecote esteemed as absolute proof, her sound heart and
<!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>loving faith always decided her that she should
discover the link in time; and the doctrine had too strong a hold
on her convictions and affections for her to doubt that the chain
of argument existed, though she had not yet found it.&nbsp; It
was not the work for which so young a head was intended, and
perhaps it was well that she was interrupted by the arrival at
home of the heads of the family.</p>
<p>Augusta and her husband were to spend the winter abroad;
Juliana had met some friends, whom she had accompanied to their
home, and though she had exacted that Ph&oelig;be should not come
out, yet the eldest daughter at home was necessarily brought
somewhat forward.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be was summoned to the family
meals, and went out driving with her mother, or riding with her
father, but was at other times in the schoolroom, where indeed
she was the most happy.</p>
<p>The life down-stairs was new to her, and she had not been
trained to the talk there expected of her.&nbsp; The one event of
her life, her visit to London, gave evident
dissatisfaction.&nbsp; There were growls whenever Robert was
mentioned, and Ph&oelig;be found that though permission had been
given for his taking the curacy, it had been without
understanding his true intentions with regard to
Whittingtonia.&nbsp; Something had evidently passed between him
and his father and brother, while on their way through London,
which had caused them to regard him as likely to be a thorn in
their side; and Ph&oelig;be could not but fear that he would meet
them in no spirit of conciliation, would rather prefer a little
persecution, and would lean to the side of pastoral rather than
filial duty, whenever they might clash.&nbsp; Even if he should
refrain from speaking his full mind to his father, he was likely
to use no precautions with his brother, and Ph&oelig;be was
uneasy whenever either went up for their weekly visit of
inspection at the office.</p>
<p>Her mother gently complained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Honora
Charlecote&rsquo;s doing, I suppose.&nbsp; He should have
considered more!&nbsp; Such a wretched place, no genteel family
near!&nbsp; Your papa would never let me go near it.&nbsp; But he
must buy an excellent living soon, where no one will know his
connection with the trade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The only sympathy Ph&oelig;be met with at home on
Robert&rsquo;s ordination, was in an unexpected quarter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then your brother has kept his resolution,&rsquo; said
Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; &lsquo;Under his reserve there is the
temper that formed the active ascetics of the middle ages.&nbsp;
His doctrine has a strong medi&aelig;val tinge, and with
sufficient strength of purpose, may lead to like
results.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Ph&oelig;be proudly told Miss Charlecote of this remark,
they agreed that it was a valuable testimony, both to the
doctrines and the results.&nbsp; Honor had had a letter from
Robert, that made her feel by force of contrast that Owen was
more than three years from a like conception of clerical
duty.</p>
<p>The storm came at last.&nbsp; By order of the Court of
Chancery, there was put up for sale a dreary section of
Whittingtonia, in <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>dire decay, and remote from
civilization.&nbsp; The firm of Fulmort and Son had long had
their eyes on it, as an eligible spot for a palace for the supply
of their commodity; and what was their rage when their agent was
out-bidden, and the tenements knocked down to an unknown customer
for a fancy price!&nbsp; After much alarm lest a rival distiller
should be invading their territory, their wrath came to a height
when it finally appeared that the new owner of the six ruinous
houses in Cicely Row was no other than the Reverend Robert Mervyn
Fulmort, with the purpose of building a church and schools for
Whittingtonia at his own expense.</p>
<p>Mervyn came home furious.&nbsp; High words had passed between
the brothers, and his report of them so inflamed Mr. Fulmort,
that he inveighed violently against the malice and treachery that
scrupled not to undermine a father.&nbsp; Never speaking to
Robert again, casting him off, and exposing the vicar for
upholding filial insolence and undutifulness, were the mildest of
his threats.&nbsp; They seemed to imagine that Robert was making
this outlay, supposing that he would yet be made equal in fortune
by his father to the others, and there was constant repetition
that he was to expect not a farthing&mdash;he had had his share
and should have no more.&nbsp; There was only a scoff at
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s innocence, when she expressed her certainty
that he looked for no compensation, knowing that he had been
provided for, and was to have nothing from his father; and
Ph&oelig;be trembled under such abuse of her favourite brother,
till she could bear it no longer, and seizing the moment of
Mervyn&rsquo;s absence, she came up to her father, and said, in
as coaxing a tone as she could, &lsquo;Papa, should not every one
work to the utmost in his trade?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of that, little one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then pray don&rsquo;t be angry with Robert for acting
up to his,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, clasping her hands, and
resting them fondly on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Act up to a fool&rsquo;s head!&nbsp; Parsons should
mind their business and not fly in their fathers&rsquo;
faces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it their work to make people more
good?&rsquo; continued Ph&oelig;be, with an unconscious wiliness,
looking more simple than her wont.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let him begin with himself then!&nbsp; Learn his duty
to his father!&nbsp; A jackanapes; trying to damage my business
under my very nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If those poor people are in such need of having good
done to them&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scum of the earth!&nbsp; Much use trying to do good to
them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but if it be his work to try? and if he wanted a
place to build a school&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re in league with him, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, papa!&nbsp; It surprised me very much.&nbsp; Even
Mr. Parsons knew nothing of his plans, Robert only wrote to me
when it <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>was done, that now he hoped to save
a few of the children that are turned out in the streets to
steal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Steal!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll steal all his
property!&nbsp; A proper fool your uncle was to leave it all to a
lad like that.&nbsp; The sure way to spoil him!&nbsp; I could
have trebled all your fortunes if that capital had been in my
hands, and now to see him throw it to the dogs!&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, I can&rsquo;t stand it.&nbsp; Conscience?&nbsp; I
hate such coxcombry!&nbsp; As if men would not make beasts of
themselves whether his worship were in the business or
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; ventured Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;but at least
he has no part in their doing so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much you know about it,&rsquo; said her father, again
shielding himself with his newspaper, but so much less angrily
than she had dared to expect, that even while flushed and
trembling, she felt grateful to him as more placable than
Mervyn.&nbsp; She knew not the power of her own sweet face and
gently honest manner, nor of the novelty of an attentive
daughter.</p>
<p>When the neighbours remarked on Mrs. Fulmort&rsquo;s improved
looks and spirits, and wondered whether they were the effect of
the Rhine or of &lsquo;getting off&rsquo; her eldest daughter,
they knew not how many fewer dull hours she had to spend.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be visited her in her bedroom, talked at luncheon,
amused her drives, coaxed her into the garden, read to her when
she rested before dinner, and sang to her afterwards.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be likewise brought her sister&rsquo;s attainments more
into notice, though at the expense of Bertha&rsquo;s contempt for
mamma&rsquo;s preference for Maria&rsquo;s staring fuchsias and
feeble singing, above her own bold chalks from models and
scientific music, and indignation at Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
constantly bringing Maria forward rather than her own clever
self.</p>
<p>Droning narrative, long drawn out, had as much charm for Mrs.
Fulmort as for Maria.&nbsp; If she did not always listen, she
liked the voice, and she sometimes awoke into descriptions of the
dresses, parties, and acquaintance of her youth, before trifling
had sunk into dreary insipidity under the weight of too much
wealth, too little health, and &lsquo;nothing to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am glad you are not
out.&nbsp; Quiet evenings are so good for my nerves; but you are
a fine girl, and will soon want society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, mamma; I like being at home with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear!&nbsp; I shall like to take you out and see
you dressed.&nbsp; You must have advantages, or how are you to
marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear, girls always get soured if they do not
marry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Miss Charlecote, mamma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but Honor Charlecote was an heiress, and could have
had plenty of offers.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk of not marrying,
Ph&oelig;be, I beg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should like to marry some one very good and wise, who could help
me out of all my difficulties.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; I hope you did not meet
any poor curate <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>at that place of Honor
Charlecote&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Your papa would never
consent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never met anybody, mamma,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was only thinking what he should be
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what?&rsquo; said Mrs. Fulmort, with girlish
curiosity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not that it&rsquo;s any use
settling.&nbsp; I always thought I would marry a marquis&rsquo;s
younger son, because it is such a pretty title, and that he
should play on the guitar.&nbsp; But he must not be an officer,
Ph&oelig;be; we have had trouble enough about that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he is to be, mamma,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, earnestly, &lsquo;except that he should be as
sensible as Miss Fennimore, and as good as Miss Charlecote.&nbsp;
Perhaps a man could put both into one, and then he could lead me,
and always show me the reason of what is right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, Ph&oelig;be! you will never get married if
you wait for a philosopher.&nbsp; Your papa would never like a
very clever genius or an author.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to be a genius, but he must be
wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear!&nbsp; That comes of the way young ladies
are brought up.&nbsp; What would the Miss Berrilees have said,
where I was at school at Bath, if one of their young ladies had
talked of wanting to marry a wise man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be gave a faint smile, and said, &lsquo;What was Mr.
Charlecote like, mamma, whose brass was put up the day Robert was
locked into the church?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humfrey Charlecote, my dear?&nbsp; The dearest, most
good-hearted man that ever lived.&nbsp; Everybody liked
him.&nbsp; There was no one that did not feel as if they had lost
a brother when he was taken off in that sudden way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And was not he very wise, mamma?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me, Ph&oelig;be, what could have put that into
your head?&nbsp; Humfrey Charlecote a wise man?&nbsp; He was just
a common, old-fashioned, hearty country squire.&nbsp; It was only
that he was so friendly and kind-hearted that made every one
trust him, and ask his advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to have known him,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, if you married any one like that!&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s no use waiting!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nobody left
like him, and I won&rsquo;t have you an old maid!&nbsp; You are
prettier than either of your sisters&mdash;more like me when I
came away from Miss Berrilees, and had a gold-sprigged muslin for
the Assize Ball, and Humfrey Charlecote danced with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be fell into speculations on the wisdom whose counsel
all asked, and which had left such an impression of affectionate
honour.&nbsp; She would gladly lean on such an one, but if no one
of the like mould remained, she thought she could never bear the
responsibilities of marriage.</p>
<p>Meantime she erected Humfrey Charlecote&rsquo;s image into a
species of judge, laying before this vision of a wise man all
<!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>her perplexities between Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
religion and Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s reason, and all her practical
doubts between Robert&rsquo;s conflicting duties.&nbsp; Strangely
enough, the question, &lsquo;What would Mr. Charlecote have
thought?&rsquo; often aided her to cast the balance.&nbsp; Though
it was still Ph&oelig;be who decided, it was Ph&oelig;be drawn
out of herself, and strengthened by her mask.</p>
<p>With vivid interest, such as for a living man would have
amounted to love, she seized and hoarded each particle of
intelligence that she could gain respecting the object of her
admiration.&nbsp; Honora herself, though far more naturally
enthusiastic, had, with her dreamy nature and diffused raptures,
never been capable of thus reverencing him, nor of the intensity
of feeling of one whose restrained imagination and unromantic
education gave force to all her sensations.&nbsp; Yet this deep
individual regard was a more wholesome tribute than Honor had
ever paid to him, or to her other idol, for to Ph&oelig;be it was
a step, lifting her to things above and beyond, a guide on the
road, never a vision obscuring the true object.</p>
<p>Six weeks had quietly passed, when, like a domestic
thunderbolt, came Juliana&rsquo;s notification of her intention
to return home at the end of a week.&nbsp; Mrs. Fulmort, clinging
to her single thread of comfort, hoped that Ph&oelig;be might
still be allowed to come to her boudoir, but the gentlemen more
boldly declared that they wanted Ph&oelig;be, and would not have
her driven back into the schoolroom; to which the mother only
replied with fears that Juliana would be in a dreadful temper,
whereon Mervyn responded, &lsquo;Let her!&nbsp; Never mind her,
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Stick up for yourself, and we&rsquo;ll put her
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Except for knowing that she was useful to her mother,
Ph&oelig;be would have thankfully retired into the west wing,
rather than have given umbrage.&nbsp; Mervyn&rsquo;s partisanship
was particularly alarming, and, endeavour as she might to hope
that Juliana would be amiable enough to be disarmed by her own
humility and unobtrusiveness, she lived under the impression of
disagreeables impending.</p>
<p>One morning at breakfast, Mr. Fulmort, after grumbling out his
wonder at Juliana&rsquo;s writing to him, suddenly changed his
tone into, &lsquo;Hollo! what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; &ldquo;My
engagement&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; shouted Mervyn; &lsquo;too good to be
true.&nbsp; So she&rsquo;s done it.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;d been such an ass, having had one escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; continued Mr. Fulmort, puzzling, as he held
the letter far off&mdash;&lsquo;engagement to dear&mdash;dear
Devil, does she say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only fit match,&rsquo; muttered Mervyn,
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, sir!&nbsp; Bevil&mdash;Sir Bevil
Acton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! not the fellow that gave us so much
trouble!&nbsp; He had not a sixpence; but she must please herself
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you didn&rsquo;t know what
she went with the Merivales for?&mdash;five thousand a year and a
baronetcy, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The deuce!&nbsp; If I had known that, he might have had
her long ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite recent,&rsquo; said
Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;A mere chance; and he has been knocking
about in the colonies these ten years&mdash;might have cut his
wisdom teeth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten years&mdash;not half-a-dozen!&rsquo; said Mr.
Fulmort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten!&rsquo; reiterated Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was just
before I went to old Raymond&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Acton took me to dine
at the mess.&nbsp; He was a nice fellow then, and deserved better
luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten years&rsquo; constancy!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
who had been looking from one to the other in wonder, trying to
collect intelligence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; whistled Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;Juliana
hadn&rsquo;t her sharp nose nor her sharp tongue when first she
came out.&nbsp; Acton was quartered at Elverslope, and got
smitten.&nbsp; She flirted with him all the winter; but I fancy
she didn&rsquo;t give you much trouble when he came to the point,
eh, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought him an impudent young dog for thinking of a
girl of her prospects; but if he had this to look to!&mdash;I was
sorry for him, too!&nbsp; Ten years ago,&rsquo; mused Mr.
Fulmort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she has liked no one since?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or no one has liked her, which comes to the
same,&rsquo; said Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;The regiment went to the
Cape, and there was an end of it, till we fell in with the
Merivales on board the steamer; and they mentioned their
neighbour, Sir Bevil Acton, come into his property, and been
settled near them a year or two.&nbsp; Fine sport it was, to see
Juliana angling for an invitation, brushing up her friendship
with Minnie Merivale&mdash;amiable to the last degree!&nbsp; My
stars! what work she must have had to play good temper all these
six weeks, and how we shall have to pay for it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or Acton will,&rsquo; said Mr. Fulmort, with a hearty
chuckle of triumphant good-humour.</p>
<p>Was it a misfortune to Ph&oelig;be to have been so much
refined by education as to be grated on by the vulgar tone of
those nearest to her?&nbsp; It was well for her that she could
still put it aside as their way, even while following her own
instinct.&nbsp; Mervyn and Juliana had been on cat and dog terms
all their lives; he was certain to sneer at all that concerned
her, and Ph&oelig;be reserved her belief that an attachment,
nipped in the bud, was ready to blossom in sunshine.&nbsp; She
ran up with the news to her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Juliana going to be married!&nbsp; Well, my dear, you
may be introduced at once!&nbsp; How comfortable you and I shall
be in the little brougham.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be begged to be told what the intended was like.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see&mdash;was he the one that won the
steeple-chase?&nbsp; No; that was the one that Augusta
liked.&nbsp; We knew so many young men, that I could never tell
which was which; and your sisters were always talking about them
till it quite ran through my poor head, such merry girls as they
were!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And poor Juliana never was so merry after he was
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rsquo; replied this careful
mother; &lsquo;but you <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>know she
never could have meant anything, for he had nothing, and you with
your fortunes are a match for anybody!&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, my
dear, we must go to London next spring, and you shall marry a
nobleman.&nbsp; I must see you a titled lady as well as your
sisters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection, provided he is my wise
man,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>Juliana had found the means of making herself welcome, and her
marriage a cause of unmixed jubilation in her family.&nbsp;
Prosperity made her affable, and instead of suppressing
Ph&oelig;be, she made her useful, and treated her as a
confidante, telling her of all the previous intimacy, and all the
secret sufferings in dear Bevil&rsquo;s absence, but passing
lightly over the last happy meeting, which Ph&oelig;be respected
as too sacred to be talked of.</p>
<p>The little maiden&rsquo;s hopes of a perfect brother in the
constant knight rose high, and his appearance and demeanour did
not disappoint them.&nbsp; He had a fine soldierly figure, and
that air of a thorough gentleman which Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s Holt
experience had taught her to appreciate; his manners were
peculiarly gentle and kind, especially to Mrs. Fulmort; and
Ph&oelig;be did not like him the less for showing traces of the
effects of wounds and climate, and a grave, subdued air, almost
amounting to melancholy.&nbsp; But before he had been three days
at Beauchamp, Juliana made a virulent attack on the privileges of
her younger sisters.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the consequence of poor
Maria&rsquo;s volunteer to Sir Bevil&mdash;&lsquo;I am glad
Juliana is going with you, for now no one will be cross to
me;&rsquo; but it seemed to verify the poor girl&rsquo;s words,
that she should be hunted like a strange cat if she were found
beyond her own precincts, and that the other two should be
treated much in the same manner.&nbsp; Bertha stood up for her
rights, declaring that what mamma and Miss Fennimore allowed, she
would not give up for Juliana; but the only result was an
admonition to the governess, and a fierce remonstrance to the
poor meek mother.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, who only wished to retire
from the stage in peace, had a more difficult part to play.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; demanded Mervyn,
making his way up to her as she sat in a remote corner of the
drawing-room, in the evening.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why were you not at
dinner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was no room, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense! our table dines eight-and-twenty, and there
were not twenty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a large party, and you know I am not
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look like it in that long-sleeved white
affair, and nothing on your head either.&nbsp; Where are those
ivy-leaves you had yesterday&mdash;real, weren&rsquo;t
they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were not liked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not liked! they were the prettiest things I have seen
for a long time.&nbsp; Acton said they made you look like a
nymph&mdash;the green suits that shiny light hair of yours, and
makes you like a picture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they made me look forward and affected.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&lsquo;Now who told you that?&nbsp; Has the Fennimore
got to her old tricks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see! a jealous toad!&nbsp; I heard him telling her
that you reminded him of her in old times.&nbsp; The spiteful
vixen!&nbsp; Well, Ph&oelig;be, if you cut her out, I bargain for
board and lodging at Acton Manor.&nbsp; This will be no place for
a quiet, meek soul like me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to laugh, but looked distressed,
uncomprehending, and far from wishing to comprehend.&nbsp; She
could not escape, for Mervyn had penned her up, and went on:
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t pretend that you don&rsquo;t see how it
is!&nbsp; That unlucky fellow is heartily sick of his bargain,
but you see he was too soft to withstand her throwing herself
right at his head, and doing the &ldquo;worm in the bud,&rdquo;
and the cruel father, green and yellow melancholy, &amp;c., ever
since they were inhumanly parted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Mervyn.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t really believe
it is all out of honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should never have believed a man of his years could
be so green; but some men get crotchets about honour in the army,
especially if they get elderly there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very noble, if it be right, and he can take those
vows from his heart,&rsquo; moralized Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But no, Mervyn, she cannot think so.&nbsp; No woman could
take any one on such terms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t she, though?&rsquo; sneered her
brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;d have him if grim death were
hanging on to his other hand.&nbsp; People aren&rsquo;t
particular, when they are nigh upon their third ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me such things!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe them; but they ought never to be suggested.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to thank me for teaching you knowledge of the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was called off, but heavy at her heart lay the text,
&lsquo;The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn&rsquo;s confidences were serious troubles to
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Gratifying as it was to be singled out by his
favour, it was distressing to be the repository of what she knew
ought never to have been spoken, prompted by a coarse tone of
mind, and couched in language that, though he meant it to be
restrained, sometimes seemed to her like the hobgoblins&rsquo;
whispers to Christian.&nbsp; Oh! how unlike her other
brother!&nbsp; Robert had troubles, Mervyn grievances, and she
saw which were the worst to bear.&nbsp; It was a pleasing novelty
to find a patient listener, and he used it to the utmost, while
she often doubted whether to hear without remonstrance were not
undutiful, yet found opposition rather increased the evil by the
storm of ill-temper that it provoked.</p>
<p>This last communication was dreadful to her, yet she could not
but feel that it might be a wholesome warning to avoid giving
offence to the jealousy which, when once pointed out to her, she
could not prevent herself from tracing in Juliana&rsquo;s
petulance towards herself, and resolve to force her into the <!--
page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>background.&nbsp; Even Bertha was more often brought
forward, for in spite of a tongue and temper cast somewhat in a
similar mould, she was rather a favourite with Juliana, whom she
was not unlikely to resemble, except that her much more elaborate
and accurate training might give her both more power and more
self-control.</p>
<p>As Mervyn insinuated, Juliana was prudent in not lengthening
out the engagement, and the marriage was fixed for Christmas
week, but it was not to take place at Hiltonbury.&nbsp; Sir Bevil
was bashful, and dreaded county festivities, and Juliana wished
to escape from Maria as a bridesmaid, so they preferred the
privacy of an hotel and a London church.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be could
not decently be excluded, and her heart leapt with the hope of
seeing Robert, though so unwelcome was his name in the family
that she could not make out on what terms he stood, whether
proscribed, or only disapproved, and while sure that he would
strive to be with her, she foresaw that the pleasure would be at
the cost of much pain.&nbsp; Owen Sandbrook was spending his
vacation at the Holt, and Miss Charlecote looked so bright as she
walked to church leaning on his arm, that Ph&oelig;be had no
regrets in leaving her.&nbsp; Indeed, the damsel greatly
preferred the Holt in his absence.&nbsp; She did not understand
his discursive comments on all things in art or nature, and he
was in a mood of flighty fitful spirits, which perplexed her
alike by their wild, satirical mirth, and their mournful
sentiment.&nbsp; She thought Miss Charlecote was worried and
perplexed at times by his tone; but there was no doubt of his
affection and attention for his &lsquo;Sweet Honey,&rsquo; and
Ph&oelig;be rejoiced that her own absence should be at so
opportune a moment.</p>
<p>Sir Bevil went to make his preparations at home, whence he was
to come and join the Fulmorts the day after their arrival in
town.&nbsp; Mrs. Fulmort was dragged out in the morning, and
deposited at Farrance&rsquo;s in time for luncheon, a few minutes
before a compact little brougham set down Lady Bannerman, jollier
than ever in velvet and sable, and more scientific in cutlets and
pale ale.&nbsp; Her good-nature was full blown.&nbsp; She was
ready to chaperon her sisters anywhere, invited the party to the
Christmas dinner, and undertook the grand <i>soir&eacute;e</i>
after the wedding.&nbsp; She proposed to take Juliana at once out
shopping, only lamenting that there was no room for Ph&oelig;be,
and was so universally benevolent, that in the absence of the
bride elect, Ph&oelig;be ventured to ask whether she saw anything
of Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert?&nbsp; Yes, he called when we first came to
town, and we asked him to dinner; but he said it was a fast day;
and you know Sir Nicholas would never encourage that sort of
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He looked odder than ever, and so ill and
cadaverous.&nbsp; No wonder! poking himself up in such a horrid
place, where one can&rsquo;t notice him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he seem in tolerable spirits?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He always was silent
and glum; and now he seems wrapped up in nothing but ragged
schools and those disgusting City missions; I&rsquo;m sure we
can&rsquo;t subscribe, so expensive as it is living in
town.&nbsp; Imagine, mamma, what we are giving our
cook!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Juliana returned, and the two sisters went out, leaving
Ph&oelig;be to extract entertainment for her mother from the
scenes passing in the street.</p>
<p>Presently a gentleman&rsquo;s handsome cabriolet and
distinguished-looking horse were affording food for their
descriptions, when, to her surprise, Sir Bevil emerged from it,
and presently entered the room.&nbsp; He had come intending to
take out his betrothed, and in her absence transferred the offer
to her sister.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be demurred, on more accounts than
she could mention, but her mother remembering what a drive in a
stylish equipage with a military baronet would once have been to
herself, overruled her objections, and hurried her away to
prepare.&nbsp; She quickly returned, a cheery spectacle in her
russet dress and brown straw bonnet, and her scarlet neck-tie,
the robin redbreast&rsquo;s livery which she loved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your cheeks should be a refreshing sight to the
Londoners, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Sir Bevil, with his rare, but
most pleasant smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where shall we go?&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t seem much to care for the Park.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m at
your service wherever you like to go.&rsquo;&nbsp; And as
Ph&oelig;be hesitated, with cheeks trebly beneficial to the
Londoners, he kindly added, &lsquo;Well, what is it?&nbsp; Never
mind what!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m open to anything&mdash;even Madame
Tussaud&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I might go to see Robert.&nbsp; Augusta said he was
looking ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear!&rsquo; interposed her mother, &lsquo;you
can&rsquo;t think of it.&nbsp; Such a dreadful place, and such a
distance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only a little way beyond St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
there are no bad streets, dear mamma.&nbsp; I have been there
with Miss Charlecote.&nbsp; But if it be too far, or you
don&rsquo;t like driving into the City, never mind,&rsquo; she
continued, turning to Sir Bevil; &lsquo;I ought to have said
nothing about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Sir Bevil, reading the ardour of the wish in the honest
face, pronounced the expedition an excellent idea, and carried
her off with her eyes as round and sparkling as those of the
children going to Christmas parties.&nbsp; He stole glances at
her as if her fresh innocent looks were an absolute treat to him,
and when he talked, it was of Robert in his boyhood.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I remember him at twelve years old, a sturdy young
ruffian, with an excellent notion of standing up for
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be listened with delight to some characteristic
anecdotes of Robert&rsquo;s youth, and wondered whether he would
be appreciated now.&nbsp; She did not think Sir Bevil held the
same opinions as Robert or Miss Charlecote; he was an upright,
high-minded soldier, with honour and subordination his chief
religion, and not likely to enter into Robert&rsquo;s
peculiarities.&nbsp; She was in some difficulty when she was
asked whether her brother were not <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>under some
cloud, or had not been taking a line of his own&mdash;a gentler
form of inquiry, which she could answer with the simple
truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he would not take a share in the business, because
he thought it promoted evil, and he felt it right to do parish
work at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s, because our profits chiefly come
from thence.&nbsp; It does not please at home, because they think
he could have done better for himself, and he sometimes is
obliged to interfere with Mervyn&rsquo;s plans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bevil made the less answer because they were in the full
current of London traffic, and his proud chestnut was snuffing
the hat of an omnibus conductor.&nbsp; Careful driving was
needed, and Ph&oelig;be was praised for never even looking
frightened, then again for her organ of locality and the skilful
pilotage with which she unerringly and unhesitatingly found the
way through the Whittingtonian labyrinths; and as the disgusted
tiger pealed at the knocker of Turnagain Corner, she was told she
would be a useful guide in the South African bush.&nbsp;
&lsquo;At home,&rsquo; was the welcome reply, and in another
second her arms were round Robert&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; There was a
thorough brotherly greeting between him and Sir Bevil; each saw
in the other a man to be respected, and Robert could not but be
grateful to the man who brought him Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>Her eyes were on the alert to judge how he had been using
himself in the last half-year.&nbsp; He looked thin, yet that
might be owing to his highly clerical coat, and some of his rural
ruddiness was gone, but there was no want of health of form or
face, only the spareness and vigour of thorough working
condition.&nbsp; His expression was still grave even to sadness,
and sternness seemed gathering round his thin lips.&nbsp; Heavy
of heart he doubtless was still, but she was struck by the
absence of the undefined restlessness that had for years been
habitual to both brothers, and which had lately so increased on
Mervyn, that there was a relief in watching a face free from it,
and telling not indeed of happiness, but of a mind made up to do
without it.</p>
<p>She supposed that his room ought to satisfy her, for though
untidy in female eyes, it did not betray ultra
self-neglect.&nbsp; The fire was brisk, there was a respectable
luncheon on the table, and he had even treated himself to the
<i>Guardian</i>, some new books, and a beautiful photograph of a
foreign cathedral.&nbsp; The room was littered with half-unrolled
plans, which had to be cleared before the guests could find
seats, and he had evidently been beguiling his luncheon with the
perusal of some large MS. sheets, red-taped together at the upper
corner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s handsome,&rsquo; said Sir Bevil.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What is it for?&nbsp; A school or almshouses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something of both,&rsquo; said Robert, his colour
rising.&nbsp; &lsquo;We want a place for disposing of the
destitute children that swarm in this district.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&lsquo;Oh, show me!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is it to be at that place in Cicely Row?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stiff sheets were unrolled, the designs explained.&nbsp;
There was to be a range of buildings round a court, consisting of
day-schools, a home for orphans, a <i>cr&egrave;che</i> for
infants, a reading-room for adults, and apartments for the clergy
of the Church which was to form one side of the quadrangle.&nbsp;
Sir Bevil was much interested, and made useful criticisms.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; he objected, &lsquo;what is the use of
building new churches in the City, when there is no filling those
you have?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Wulstan&rsquo;s is better filled than
formerly,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;The pew system is the
chief enemy there; but even without that, it would not hold a
tenth part of the Whittingtonian population, would they come to
it, which they will not.&nbsp; The Church must come to them, and
with special services at their own times.&nbsp; They need an
absolute mission, on entirely different terms from the Woolstone
quarter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are you about to head the mission?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To endeavour to take a share in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is to be at the cost of this?&rsquo; pursued
Sir Bevil.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you a subscription list?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert coloured again as he answered, &lsquo;Why, no; we can
do without that so far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be understood, and her face must have revealed the
truth to Sir Bevil, for laying his hand on Robert&rsquo;s arm, he
said, &lsquo;My good fellow, you don&rsquo;t mean that you are
answerable for all this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I have something of my own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not leave much of it at this rate.&nbsp; How
about the endowment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall live upon the endowment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you considered?&nbsp; You will be tied to this
place for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is one of my objects,&rsquo; replied Robert, and
in reply to a look of astonished interrogation, &lsquo;myself and
all that is mine would be far too little to atone for a fraction
of the evil that our house is every day perpetrating
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should hate the business myself,&rsquo; said the
baronet; &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t you see it in a strong
light?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every hour I spend here shows me that I do not see it
strongly enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there followed some appalling instances of the effects of
the multiplicity of gin-palaces, things that it well-nigh broke
Robert&rsquo;s heart to witness, absorbed as he was in the
novelty of his work, fresh in feeling, and never able to divest
himself of a sense of being a sharer in the guilt and ruin.</p>
<p>Sir Bevil listened at first with interest, then tried to lead
away from the subject; but it was Robert&rsquo;s single idea, and
he kept them to it till their departure, when Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
first <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>words were, as they drove from the
door, &lsquo;Oh, thank you, you do not know how much happier you
have made me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her companion smiled, saying, &lsquo;I need not ask which is
the favourite brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn is very kind to me,&rsquo; quickly answered
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Robert is the oracle! eh?&rsquo; he said, kindly
and merrily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert has been everything to us younger ones,&rsquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am still more glad that you like
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His grave face not responding as she expected, she feared that
he had been bored, that he thought Robert righteous over much, or
disapproved his opinions; but his answer was worth having when it
came.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know nothing about his views; I never looked
into the subject; but when I see a young man giving up a
lucrative prospect for conscience sake, and devoting himself to
work in that sink of iniquity, I see there must be something in
him.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t judge if he goes about it in a
wrong-headed way, but I should be proud of such a fellow instead
of discarding him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, with ecstasy
that made him laugh, and quite differently from the made-up
laughter she had been used to hear from him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you thanking me for?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I do not imagine that I shall be able to serve him.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll talk to your father about him, but he must be the best
judge of the discipline of his own family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not thinking of your doing anything,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but a kind word about Robert does make me
very grateful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence, only diversified by an astonished
nod from Mervyn driving back from the office.&nbsp; Just before
setting her down, Sir Bevil said, &lsquo;I wonder whether your
brother would let us give something to his church.&nbsp; Will you
find out what it shall be, and let me know?&nbsp; As a gift from
Juliana and myself&mdash;you understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was lucky for Ph&oelig;be that she had brought home a good
stock of satisfaction to support her, for she found herself in
the direst disgrace, and her mother too much cowed to venture on
more than a feeble self-defensive murmur that she had told
Ph&oelig;be it would never do.&nbsp; Convinced in her own
conscience that she had done nothing blameworthy, Ph&oelig;be
knew that it was the shortest way not to defend herself, and the
storm was blowing over when Mervyn came in, charmed to mortify
Juliana by compliments to Ph&oelig;be on &lsquo;doing it
stylishly, careering in Acton&rsquo;s turn-out,&rsquo; but when
the elder sister explained where she had been, Mervyn, too,
deserted her, and turned away with a fierce imprecation on his
brother, such as was misery to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; He
was sourly ill-humoured all the evening; Juliana wreaked her
displeasure on Sir Bevil in ungraciousness, till such silence and
gloom descended on him, that he was like another man from him who
had smiled on Ph&oelig;be in the afternoon.&nbsp; Yet, though
dismayed at the offence she had given, and <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>grieved at
these evidences of Robert&rsquo;s ill-odour with his family,
Ph&oelig;be could not regret having seized her single chance of
seeing Robert&rsquo;s dwelling for herself, nor the having made
him known to Sir Bevil.&nbsp; The one had made her satisfied, the
other hopeful, even while she recollected, with foreboding, that
truth sometimes comes not with peace, but with a sword, to set at
variance parent and child, and make foes of them of the same
household.</p>
<p>Juliana never forgave that drive.&nbsp; She continued bitter
towards Ph&oelig;be, and kept such a watch over her and Sir
Bevil, that the jealous surveillance became palpable to
both.&nbsp; Sir Bevil really wanted to tell Ph&oelig;be the
unsatisfactory result of his pleading for Robert; she wanted to
tell him of Robert&rsquo;s gratitude for his offered gift; but
the exchange of any words in private was out of their power, and
each silently felt that it was best to make no move towards one
another till the unworthy jealousy should have died away.</p>
<p>Though Sir Bevil had elicited nothing but abuse of
&lsquo;pigheaded folly,&rsquo; his espousal of the young
clergyman&rsquo;s cause was not without effect.&nbsp; Robert was
not treated with more open disfavour than he had often previously
endured, and was free to visit the party at Farrance&rsquo;s, if
he chose to run the risk of encountering his father&rsquo;s blunt
coldness, Mervyn&rsquo;s sulky dislike, and Juliana&rsquo;s sharp
satire, but as he generally came so as to find his mother and
Ph&oelig;be alone, some precious moments compensated for the
various disagreeables.&nbsp; Nor did these affect him nearly as
much as they did his sister.&nbsp; It was, in fact, one of his
remaining unwholesome symptoms that he rather enjoyed
persecution, and took no pains to avoid giving offence.&nbsp; If
he meant to be uncompromising, he sometimes was simply provoking,
and Ph&oelig;be feared that Sir Bevil thought him an unpromising
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>He was asked to the Christmas dinner at the Bannermans&rsquo;,
and did not fulfil Augusta&rsquo;s prediction that he would say
it was a fast day, and refuse.&nbsp; That evening gave
Ph&oelig;be her best <i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;te</i> with
him, but she observed that all was about Whittingtonia, not one
word of the past summer, not so much as an inquiry for Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; Evidently that page in his history was closed
for ever, and if he should carry out his designs in their present
form, a wife at the intended institution would be an
impossibility.&nbsp; How near the dearest may be to one another,
and yet how little can they guess at what they would most desire
to know.</p>
<p>Sir Bevil had insisted on his being asked to perform the
ceremony, and she longed to understand whether his refusal were
really on the score of his being a deacon, or if he had any
further motive.&nbsp; His own family were affronted, though glad
to be left free to request the services of the greatest dignitary
of their acquaintance, and Sir Bevil&rsquo;s blunt &lsquo;No, no,
poor fellow! say no more about it,&rsquo; made her suppose that
he <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>suspected that Robert&rsquo;s vehemence in his parish
was meant to work off a disappointment.</p>
<p>It was a dreary wedding, in spite of London grandeur.&nbsp; In
all her success, Juliana could not help looking pinched and ill
at ease, her wreath and veil hardening instead of softening her
features, and her bridegroom&rsquo;s studious cheerfulness and
forced laughs became him less than his usual silent
dejection.&nbsp; The Admiral was useful in getting up stock
wedding-wit, but Ph&oelig;be wondered how any one could laugh at
it; and her fellow-bridesmaids, all her seniors, seemed to her,
as perhaps she might to them, like thoughtless children, playing
with the surface of things.&nbsp; She pitied Sir Bevil, and saw
little chance of happiness for either, yet heard only
congratulations, and had to be bright, busy, and helpful, under a
broad, stiff, white watered silk scarf, beneath which Juliana had
endeavoured to extinguish her, but in which her tall rounded
shape looked to great advantage.&nbsp; Indeed, that young rosy
face, and the innocently pensive wondering eyes were so sweet,
that the bride had to endure hearing admiration of her sister
from all quarters, and the Acton bridemaidens whispered rather
like those at Netherby Hall.</p>
<p>It was over, and Ph&oelig;be was the reigning Miss
Fulmort.&nbsp; Her friends were delighted for her and for
themselves, and her mother entered on the full enjoyment of the
little brougham.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some dear scheme<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of our life doth seem<br />
Shivered at once like a broken dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our hearts to reel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like ships that feel<br />
A sharp rock grating against their keel.&mdash;C. F. A.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was high summer; and in spite of cholera-averting
thunderstorms, the close streets and the odour of the Thames were
becoming insufferable.&nbsp; Mr. Parsons arranged a series of
breathing times for his clerical staff, but could make Robert
Fulmort accept none.&nbsp; He was strong and healthy, ravenous of
work, impervious to disgusts, and rejected holidays as burdensome
and hateful.&nbsp; Where should he go?&nbsp; What could he
do?&nbsp; What would become of his wild scholars without him, and
who would superintend his buildings?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons was fain to let him have his own way, as had
happened in some previous instances, specially the edifice in
Cicely Row, where the incumbent would have paused, but the curate
rushed on with resolute zeal and impetuosity, taking measures so
decidedly ere his intentions were revealed, that neither
remonstrance nor prevention were easy, and a species of annoyed,
doubtful admiration alone was possible.&nbsp; It was sometimes a
gratifying reflection to the vicar, that when the <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>buildings were finished, Whittingtonia would become a
district, and its busy curate be no longer under his
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Meantime Robert was left with a companion in priest&rsquo;s
orders, but newer to the parish than himself, to conduct the
services at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s, while the other curates were
taking holiday, and the vicar at his son&rsquo;s
country-house.&nbsp; To see how contentedly, nay, pleasurably,
&lsquo;Fulmort&rsquo; endured perpetual broiling, passing from
frying school to grilling pavement, and seething human hive, was
constant edification to his colleague, who, fresh from the calm
university, felt such a life to be a slow martyrdom, and wished
his liking for the deacon were in better proportion to his
esteem.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A child to be baptized at 8, Little
Whittington-street,&rsquo; he said, with resigned despair, as at
the vestry door he received a message from a small maid, one
afternoon, when the air looked lucid yellow with sultry fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rsquo; replied Robert, with the alacrity
that sometimes almost irritated his fellows; and off he sped,
with alert steps, at which his friend gazed with the sensation of
watching a salamander.</p>
<p>Little Whittington-street, where it was not warehouses, was
chiefly occupied by small tradesfolk, or by lodging-houses for
the numerous &lsquo;young men&rsquo; employed in the City.&nbsp;
It was one of the most respectable parts of that quarter, but
being much given to dissent, was little frequented by the clergy,
who had too much immorality to contend with, to have leisure to
speak against schism.</p>
<p>When he rang at No. 8, the little maid ushered him down a
narrow, dark staircase, and announcing, &lsquo;Please,
ma&rsquo;am, here&rsquo;s the minister,&rsquo; admitted him into
a small room, feeling like a cellar, the window opening into an
area.&nbsp; It was crowded with gay and substantial furniture,
and contained two women, one lying on a couch, partially hidden
by a screen, the other an elderly person, in a widow&rsquo;s cap,
with an infant in her arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning, sir; we were sorry to trouble you, but I
felt certain, as I told my daughter, that a minister of the
Gospel would not tarry in time of need.&nbsp; Not that I put my
trust in ordinances, sir; I have been blest with the
enlightenment of the new birth, but my daughter, sir, she follows
the Church.&nbsp; Yes, sir, the poor little lamb is a sad
sufferer in this vale of tears.&nbsp; So wasted away, you see;
you would not think he was nine weeks old.&nbsp; We would have
brought him to church before, sir, only my daughter&rsquo;s
hillness, and her &lsquo;usband&rsquo;s habsence.&nbsp; It was
always her wish, sir, and I was not against it, for many true
Christians have found grace in the Church, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert considered whether to address himself to the young
mother, whose averted face and uneasy movements seemed to show
that this stream of words was distressing to her.&nbsp; He
thought silence would be best procured by his assumption of his
<!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>office, and quietly made his preparations, opened his
book, and took his place.</p>
<p>The young woman, raising herself with difficulty, said in a
low, sweet voice, &lsquo;The gentleman is ready,
mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As there was no pressing danger, he read the previous
collects, the elder female responding with devout groans, the
younger sinking on her knees, her face hidden in her wasted
hands.&nbsp; He took the little feeble being in his arms, and
demanded the name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hoeing Charterhouse,&rsquo; replied the
grandmother.</p>
<p>He looked interrogative, and Hoeing Charterhouse was
repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen Charteris,&rsquo; said the low, sweet voice.</p>
<p>A thrill shot over his whole frame, as his look met a large,
full, liquid pair of dark eyes, such as once seen could never be
forgotten, though dropped again instantly, while a burning blush
arose, instantly veiled by the hands, which hid all up to the
dark hair.</p>
<p>Recalling himself by an effort, he repeated the too familiar
name, and baptized the child, bending his head over it afterwards
in deep compassion and mental entreaty both for its welfare, and
his own guidance in the tissue of wrongdoing thus
disclosed.&nbsp; A hasty, stealthy glance at the hands covering
the mother&rsquo;s face, showed him the ring on her fourth
finger, and as they rose from their knees, he said, &lsquo;I am
to register this child as Owen Charteris Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a look of deadly terror, she faintly exclaimed, &lsquo;I
have done it!&nbsp; You know him, sir; you will not betray
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you, too,&rsquo; said Robert, sternly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You were the schoolmistress at Wrapworth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was, sir.&nbsp; It was all my fault.&nbsp; Oh!
promise me, sir, never to betray him; it would be the ruin of his
prospects for ever!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she came towards him, her
hands clasped in entreaty, her large eyes shining with feverish
lustre, her face wasted but still lovely, a piteous contrast to
the queenly being of a year ago in her pretty schoolroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Compose yourself,&rsquo; said Robert, gravely; &lsquo;I
hope never to betray any one.&nbsp; I confess that I am shocked,
but I will endeavour to act rightly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure, sir,&rsquo; broke in Mrs. Murrell, with
double volume, after her interval of quiescence, &lsquo;it is not
to be expected but what a gentleman&rsquo;s friends would be
offended.&nbsp; It was none of my wish, sir, being that I never
knew a word of it till she was married, and it was too late, or I
would have warned her against broken cisterns.&nbsp; But as for
her, sir, she is as innocent as a miserable sinner can be in a
fallen world.&nbsp; It was the young gentleman as sought her
out.&nbsp; I always misdoubted the ladies noticing her, and
making her take part with men-singers and women-singers, and such
vanities as is pleasing to the unregenerate heart.&nbsp; Ah! sir,
without grace, where are we?&nbsp; Not that <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>he was ever
other than most honourable with her, or she would never have
listened to him not for a moment, but she was over-persuaded,
sir, and folks said what they hadn&rsquo;t no right to say, and
the minister, he was &lsquo;ard on her, and so, you see, sir, she
took fright and married him out of &lsquo;and, trusting to a harm
of flesh, and went to Hireland with him.&nbsp; She just writ me a
note, which filled my &lsquo;art with fear and trembling, a
&lsquo;nonymous note, with only Hedna signed to it; and I waited,
with failing eyes and sorrow of heart, till one day in autumn he
brings her back to me, and here she has been ever since, dwining
away in a nervous fever, as the doctors call it, as it&rsquo;s a
misery to see her, and he never coming nigh her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once,&rsquo; murmured Edna, who had several times tried
to interrupt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once, ay, for one hour at Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is known here; he can&rsquo;t venture often,&rsquo;
interposed the wife; and there was a further whisper, &lsquo;he
couldn&rsquo;t stay, he couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the dejected accents were lost in the old woman&rsquo;s
voice,&mdash;&lsquo;Now, sir, if you know him or his family, I
wouldn&rsquo;t be wishing to do him no hinjury, nor to ruinate
his prospects, being, as he says, that the rich lady will make
him her hare; but, sir, if you have any power with him as a godly
minister or the friend of his youth maybe&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is only waiting till he has a curacy&mdash;a house
of his own&mdash;mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Edna, hold your peace.&nbsp; It is not fit that I
should see my only child cut down as the grass of the field, and
left a burthen upon me, a lone woman, while he is eating of the
fat of the land.&nbsp; I say it is scandalous that he should
leave her here, and take no notice; not coming near her since one
hour at Christmas, and only just sending her a few pounds now and
then; not once coming to see his own child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He could not; he is abroad!&rsquo; pleaded Edna.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He tells you he is abroad!&rsquo; exclaimed Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He went to Paris at Easter.&nbsp; He promised to come
when he comes home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You poor thing!&rsquo; burst out Robert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is deceiving you!&nbsp; He came back at the end of
three weeks.&nbsp; I heard from my sister that she saw him on
Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert heartily rued his abruptness, as the poor young wife
sank back in a deadly swoon.&nbsp; The grandmother hurried to
apply remedies, insisting that the gentleman should not go, and
continuing all the time her version of her daughter&rsquo;s
wrongs.&nbsp; Her last remnant of patience had vanished on
learning this deception, and she only wanted to publish her
daughter&rsquo;s claims, proceeding to establish them by
hastening in search of the marriage certificate as soon as Edna
had begun to revive, but sooner than Robert was satisfied to be
left alone with the inanimate, helpless form on the couch.</p>
<p><!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>He was startled when Edna raised her hand, and strove
to speak,&mdash;&lsquo;Sir, do not tell&mdash;do not tell my
mother where he is.&nbsp; She must not fret him&mdash;she must
not tell his friends&mdash;he would be angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She ceased as her mother returned with the certificate of the
marriage, contracted last July before the registrar of the huge
suburban Union to which Wrapworth belonged, the centre of which
was so remote, that the pseudo-banns of Owen Charteris Sandbrook
and Edna Murrell had attracted no attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very wrong,&rsquo; feebly said Edna; &lsquo;I
drew him into it!&nbsp; I loved him so much; and they all talked
so after I went in the boat with him, that I thought my character
was gone, and I begged him to save me from them.&nbsp; It was my
fault, sir; and I&rsquo;ve the punishment.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not
betray him, sir; only don&rsquo;t let that young lady, your
sister, trust to him.&nbsp; Not yet.&nbsp; My baby and I shall
soon be out of her way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The calm languor of her tone was almost fearful, and even as
she spoke a shuddering seized her, making her tremble
convulsively, her teeth knocking together, and the couch shaking
under her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have instant advice,&rsquo; cried
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will fetch some one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t betray him,&rsquo; almost shrieked
Edna.&nbsp; &lsquo;A little while&mdash;stay a little
while&mdash;he will be free of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was delirium in look and voice, and he was compelled to
pause and assure her that he was only going for the doctor, and
would come again before taking any other step.</p>
<p>It was not till the medical man had been summoned that his
mind recurred to the words about his sister.&nbsp; He might have
dismissed them as merely the jealous suspicion of the deserted
wife, but that he remembered Lucilla&rsquo;s hint as to an
attachment between Owen and Ph&oelig;be, and he knew that such
would have been most welcome to Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Ph&oelig;be, my one bright spot!&rsquo; was his
inward cry, &lsquo;must your guileless happiness be
quenched!&nbsp; O, I would rather have it all over again myself
than that one pang should come near you, in your sweetness and
innocence, the blessing of us all!&nbsp; And I not near to guard
nor warn!&nbsp; What may not be passing even now?&nbsp;
Unprincipled, hard-hearted deceiver, walking at large among those
gentle, unsuspicious women&mdash;trading on their innocent
trust!&nbsp; Would that I had disclosed the villainy I knew
of!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His hand clenched, his brow lowered, and his mouth was set so
savagely, that the passing policeman looked in wonder from the
dangerous face to the clerical dress.</p>
<p>Early next morning he was at No. 8, and learnt that Mrs.
Brook, as the maid called her, had been very ill all night, and
that the doctor was still with her.&nbsp; Begging to see the
doctor, Robert found that high fever had set in, an aggravation
of the low nervous fever that had been consuming her strength all
the spring, and her condition was already such that there was
<!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>little hope of her surviving the present attack.&nbsp;
She had been raving all night about the young lady with whom Mr.
Sandbrook had been walking by moonlight, and when the door of the
little adjoining bedroom was open, her moans and broken words
were plainly audible.</p>
<p>Robert asked whether he should fetch her husband, and Mrs.
Murrell caught at the offer.&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s presence was the
single hope of restoring her, and at least he ought to behold the
wreck that he had wrought.&nbsp; Mrs. Murrell gave a terrible
thrust by saying, &lsquo;that the young lady at least ought to be
let know, that she might not be trusting to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not fear, Mrs. Murrell,&rsquo; he said, almost under
his breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;My only doubt is, whether I can meet
Owen Sandbrook as a Christian should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cutting off her counsels on the unconverted nature, he strode
off to find his colleague, whom he perplexed by a few rapid words
on the necessity of going into the country for the day.&nbsp; His
impatient condition required vehement action; and with a sense of
hurrying to rescue Ph&oelig;be, he could scarcely brook the
slightest delay till he was on his way to Hiltonbury, nor till
the train spared him all action could he pause to collect his
strength, guard his resentment, or adjust his measures for
warning, but not betraying.&nbsp; He could think of no honourable
mode of dealing, save carrying off Owen to London with him at
once, sacrificing the sight of his sister for the present, and
either writing or going to her afterwards, when the mode of
dealing the blow should be more evident.&nbsp; It cost him keen
suffering to believe that this was the sole right course, but he
had bound himself to it by his promise to the poor suffering
wife, blaming himself for continually putting his sister before
her in his plans.</p>
<p>At Elverslope, on his demand for a fly for Hiltonbury, he was
answered that all were engaged for the Horticultural Show in the
Forest; but the people at the station, knowing him well, made
willing exertions to procure a vehicle for him, and a taxed cart
soon making its appearance, he desired to be taken, not to the
Holt, but to the Forest, where he had no doubt that he should
find the object of his search.</p>
<p>This Horticultural Show was the great gaiety of the
year.&nbsp; The society had originated with Humfrey Charlecote,
for the benefit of the poor as well as the rich; and the summer
exhibition always took place under the trees of a fragment of the
old Forest, which still survived at about five miles from
Hiltonbury.&nbsp; The day was a county holiday.&nbsp; The
delicate orchid and the crowned pine were there, with the hairy
gooseberry, the cabbage and potato, and the homely cottage-garden
nosegay from many a woodland hamlet.&nbsp; The young ladies
competed in collections of dried flowers for a prize botany book;
and the subscriptions were so arranged that on this festival each
poorer member might, with two companions, be provided with a
hearty <!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>meal; while grandees and farmers had
a luncheon-tent of their own, and regarded the day as a county
picnic.</p>
<p>It was a favourite affair with all, intensely enjoyed, and
full of good neighbourhood.&nbsp; Humfrey Charlecote&rsquo;s
spirit never seemed to have deserted it; it was a gathering of
distant friends, a delight of children as of the full grown; and
while the young were frantic for its gipsying fun, their elders
seldom failed to attend, if only in remembrance of poor Mr.
Charlecote, &lsquo;who had begged one and all not to let it
drop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Above all, Honora felt it due to Humfrey to have prize-roots
and fruits from the Holt, and would have thought herself fallen,
indeed, had the hardest rain kept her from the rendezvous, with
one wagon carrying the cottagers&rsquo; articles, and another a
troop of school-children.&nbsp; No doubt the Forest would be the
place to find Owen Sandbrook, but for the rest&mdash;</p>
<p>From the very extremity of his perplexity, Robert&rsquo;s mind
sought relief in external objects.&nbsp; So joyous were the
associations with the Forest road on a horticultural day, that
the familiar spots could not but revive them.&nbsp; Those green
glades, where the graceful beeches retreated, making cool green
galleries with their slender gleaming stems, reminded him of his
putting his new pony to speed to come up with the Holt carriage;
that scathed oak had a tradition of lightning connected with it;
yonder was the spot where he had shown Lucilla a herd of deer;
here the rising ground whence the whole scene could be viewed,
and from force of habit he felt exhilarated as he gazed down the
slope of heather, where the fine old oaks and beeches, receding,
had left an open space, now covered with the well-known tents;
there the large one, broadly striped with green, containing the
show; there the white marquees for the eaters; the Union
Jack&rsquo;s gay colours floating lazily from a pole in the
Outlaw&rsquo;s Knoll; the dark, full foliage of the forest, and
purple tints of the heather setting off the bright female groups
in their delicate summer gaieties.&nbsp; Vehicles of all
degrees&mdash;smart barouche, lengthy britzschka, light gig,
dashing pony-carriage, rattling shanderadan, and gorgeous
wagon&mdash;were drawn up in treble file, minus their steeds; the
sounds of well-known tunes from the band were wafted on the wind,
and such an air of jocund peace and festivity pervaded the whole,
that for a moment he had a sense of holiday-making ere he sighed
at the shade that he was bringing on that scene of merriment.</p>
<p>Reaching the barrier, he paid his entrance-money, and desiring
the carriage to wait, walked rapidly down the hill.&nbsp; On one
side of the road was the gradual sweep of open heath, on the
other was a rapid slope, shaded by trees, and covered with fern,
growing tall and grand as it approached the moist ground in the
hollow below.&nbsp; Voices made him turn his head in that
direction.&nbsp; Aloof from the rest of the throng he beheld two
figures half-way down the bank, so nearly hidden among the
luxuriant, wing-like fronds of the Osmond royal which they were
<!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>gathering, that at first only their hats were
discernible&mdash;a broad gray one, with drooping feather, and a
light Oxford boating straw hat.&nbsp; The merry ring of the clear
girlish voice, the deep-toned replies, told him more than his
first glance did; and with one inward ejaculation for
self-command, he turned aside to the descent.</p>
<p>The rustling among the copsewood caught the ear of
Ph&oelig;be, who was the highest up, and, springing up like a
fawn in the covert, she cried,&mdash;&lsquo;Robin! dear Robin!
how delicious!&rsquo; but ere she had made three bounds towards
him, his face brought her to a pause, and, in an awe-struck
voice, she asked, &lsquo;Robert, what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It does not concern you, dearest; at least, I hope
not.&nbsp; I want Owen Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is <i>she</i>.&nbsp; O Robin, can you bear
it?&rsquo; she whispered, clinging to him, terrified by the
agitated fondness of his embrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing of <i>her</i>,&rsquo; was his answer,
interrupted by Owen, who, raising his handsome, ruddy face from
beneath, shouted mirthfully&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! Ph&oelig;be, what interloper have you caught?&nbsp;
What, Fulmort, not quite grilled in the Wulstonian
oven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was in search of you.&nbsp; Wait there,
Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Robert, advancing to meet Owen, with a
gravity of countenance that provoked an impatient gesture, and
the question&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, have it out!&nbsp; Do you mean that you have been
ferreting out some old scrape of mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; said Robert, looking steadily at him,
&lsquo;that I have been called in to baptize your sick
child.&nbsp; Your wife is dying, and you must hasten if you would
see her alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; You know better than
that,&rsquo; returned Owen, with ill-concealed agitation,
partaking of anger.&nbsp; &lsquo;She was quite recovered when
last I heard, but she is a famous hand at getting up a scene; and
that mother of hers would drive Job out of his senses.&nbsp; They
have worked on your weak mind.&nbsp; I was an ass to trust to the
old woman&rsquo;s dissent for hindering them from finding you
out, and getting up a scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They did not.&nbsp; It was by accident that I was the
person who answered the summons.&nbsp; They knew neither me nor
my name, so you may acquit them of any preparation.&nbsp; I
recognized your name, which I was desired to give to the child;
and then, in spite of wasting, terror, and deadly sickness, I
knew the mother.&nbsp; She has been pining under low nervous
fever, still believing you on the Continent; and the discovery
that she had been deceived, was such a shock as to bring on a
violent attack, which she is not likely to have strength to
survive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never told her I was still abroad,&rsquo; said Owen,
in a fretful tone of self-defence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only had my
letters forwarded through my scout; for I knew I should have no
peace nor safety if the old woman knew where to find me, and
preach me crazy; and I could not be going to see after her, for,
thanks to Honor <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>Charlecote and her schools, every
child in Whittingtonia knows me by sight.&nbsp; I told her to be
patient till I had a curacy, and was independent; but it seems
she could not be.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run up as soon as I can get
some plea for getting away from the Holt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Death will leave no time for your excuses,&rsquo; said
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;By setting off at once, you may catch the
five o&rsquo;clock express at W---&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is your object to have a grand
explosion!&nbsp; When I am cut out, you and Cilly may make a good
thing of it.&nbsp; I wish you joy!&nbsp; Ha! by Jove!&rsquo; he
muttered, as he saw Ph&oelig;be waiting out of earshot.&nbsp; And
then, turning from Robert, who was dumb in the effort to control
a passionate reply, he called out, &lsquo;Good-bye, Ph&oelig;be;
I beg your pardon, but you see I am summoned.&nbsp; Family claims
are imperative!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; said the maiden, terrified
not only at his tone, but at the gestures of her brother of
fierce, suppressed menace towards him, despairing protection
towards her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, he has told you!&nbsp; Matter enough, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a married man.&nbsp; I ask your
compassion!&rsquo; with a bitter laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is you who have told her,&rsquo; said Robert, who,
after a desperate effort, had forced all violence from his voice
and language.&nbsp; &lsquo;Traitor as you consider me, your
secret had not crossed my lips.&nbsp; But no&mdash;there is no
time to waste on disputes.&nbsp; Your wife is sinking under
neglect; and her seeing you once more may depend on your not
loitering away these moments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; Canting and tragedy
queening.&nbsp; Taking him in!&nbsp; I know better!&rsquo;
muttered Owen, sullenly, as he moved up the bank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Robin, how can he be so hard?&rsquo; whispered
Ph&oelig;be, as she met her brother&rsquo;s eyes wistfully fixed
on her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is altogether selfish and heartless,&rsquo; returned
Robert, in the same inaudible voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;My Ph&oelig;be,
give me this one comfort.&nbsp; You never listened to
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was nothing to listen to,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, turning her clear, surprised eyes on him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t think him so bad as that.&nbsp; O
Robin, how silly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What were you doing here?&rsquo; he asked, holding her
arm tight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only Miss Fennimore wanted some Osmunda, and Miss
Charlecote sent him to show me where it grew; because she was
talking to Lady Raymond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The free simplicity of her look made Robert breathe
freely.&nbsp; Charity was coming back to him.</p>
<p>At the same moment Owen turned, his face flushed, and full of
emotion, but the obduracy gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may take a long leave!&nbsp; When you see Honor
Charlecote, Fulmort&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not see her.&nbsp; I am going back with
you,&rsquo; said Robert, instantly deciding, now that he felt
that he could both leave Ph&oelig;be, and trust himself with the
offender.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think I want to escape!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>&lsquo;No; but I have duties to return to.&nbsp;
Besides, you will find a scene for which you are little prepared;
and which will cost you the more for your present mood.&nbsp; I
may be of use there.&nbsp; Your secret is safe with Ph&oelig;be
and me.&nbsp; I promised your wife to keep it, and we will not
rob you of the benefit of free confession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is to explain my absence?&nbsp; No, no, the
secret is one no longer, and it has been intolerable enough
already,&rsquo; said Owen, recklessly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Honor,
it will be a grievous business, and little Ph&oelig;be will be a
kind messenger.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you, Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; I leave
my cause in your hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; faltered Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;she should
hear who&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Simple child, you can&rsquo;t draw inferences.&nbsp;
Cilla wouldn&rsquo;t have asked.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember
her darling at Wrapworth?&nbsp; People shouldn&rsquo;t throw such
splendid women in one&rsquo;s way, especially when they are made
of such inflammable materials, and take fire at a civil
word.&nbsp; So ill, poor thing!&nbsp; Now, Robert, on your
honour, has not the mother been working on you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you not what the mother told me, but what the
medical man said.&nbsp; Low nervous fever set in long ago, and
she has never recovered her confinement.&nbsp; Heat and closeness
were already destroying her, when my disclosure that you were not
abroad, as she had been led to believe, brought on fainting, and
almost immediate delirium.&nbsp; This was last evening, she was
worse this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor girl, poor girl!&rsquo; muttered Owen, his face
almost convulsed with emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was no helping
it.&nbsp; She would have drowned herself if I had not taken her
with me&mdash;quite capable of it! after those intolerable women
at Wrapworth had opened fire.&nbsp; I wish women&rsquo;s tongues
were cut out by act of parliament.&nbsp; So, Ph&oelig;be, tell
poor Honor that I know I am unpardonable, but I am sincerely
sorry for her.&nbsp; I fell into it, there&rsquo;s no knowing
how, and she would pity me, and so would you, if you knew what I
have gone through.&nbsp; Good-bye, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Most likely
I shall never see you again.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you shake hands,
and tell me you are sorry for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be, if you seemed more sorry for your wife
than yourself,&rsquo; she said, holding out her hand, but by no
means prepared for his not only pressing it with fervour, but
carrying it to his lips.</p>
<p>Then, as Robert started forward with an impulse of snatching
her from him, he almost threw it from his grasp, and with a long
sigh very like bitter regret, and a murmur that resembled
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a little angel,&rsquo; he mounted the
bank.&nbsp; Robert only tarried to say, &lsquo;May I be able to
bear with him!&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, do your best for poor Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; I will write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be sat down at the foot of a tree, veiled by the
waving ferns, to take breath and understand what had
passed.&nbsp; Her first act was to strike one hand across the
other, as though to obliterate the kiss, then to draw off her
glove, and drop it in the <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>deepest of
the fern, never to be worn again.&nbsp; Hateful!&nbsp; With that
poor neglected wife pining to death in those stifling city
streets, to be making sport in those forest glades.&nbsp; Shame!
shame!&nbsp; But oh! worst of all was his patronizing pity for
Miss Charlecote!&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s own mission to Miss
Charlecote was dreadful enough, and she could have sat for hours
deliberating on the mode of carrying grief and dismay to her
friend, who had looked so joyous and exulting with her boy by her
side as she drove upon the ground; but there was no time to be
lost, and rousing herself into action with strong effort,
Ph&oelig;be left the fern brake, walking like one in a dream, and
exchanging civilities with various persons who wondered to see
her alone, made her way to the principal marquee, where luncheon
had taken place, and which always served as the rendezvous.&nbsp;
Here sat mammas, keeping up talk enough for civility, and peeping
out restlessly to cluck their broods together; here gentlemen
stood in knots, talking county business; servants congregated in
the rear, to call the carriages; stragglers gradually streamed
together, and &lsquo;Oh! here you are,&rsquo; was the staple
exclamation.</p>
<p>It was uttered by Mrs. Fulmort as Ph&oelig;be appeared, and
was followed by plaintive inquiries for her sisters, and
assurances that it would have been better to have stayed in the
cool tent, and gone home at once.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be consoled her
by ordering the carriage, and explaining that her sisters were at
hand with some other girls, then begged leave to go home with
Miss Charlecote for the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, what shall I do with the others without
you?&nbsp; Maria has such odd tricks, and Bertha is so teasing
without you!&nbsp; You promised they should not tire
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will beg them to be good, dear mamma; I am very
sorry, but it is only this once.&nbsp; She will be alone.&nbsp;
Owen Sandbrook is obliged to go away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think what she should want of you,&rsquo;
moaned her mother, &lsquo;so used as she is to be alone.&nbsp;
Did she ask you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she does not know yet.&nbsp; I am to tell her, and
that is why I want you to be so kind as to spare me, dear
mamma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, it will not do for you to be carrying young
men&rsquo;s secrets, at least not Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Your papa would not like it, my dear, until she had acknowledged
him for her heir.&nbsp; You have lost your glove, too,
Ph&oelig;be, and you look so heated, you had better come back
with me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Fulmort, who would not have withstood
for a moment a decree from either of her other daughters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;you need not
fear, mamma.&nbsp; It is nothing of that sort, quite the
contrary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite the contrary!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t tell me that
he has formed another attachment, just when I made sure of your
settling at last at the Holt, and you such a favourite with Honor
Charlecote.&nbsp; Not one of those plain Miss Raymonds, I
hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>&lsquo;I must not tell, till she has heard,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;so please say nothing about it.&nbsp; It will
vex poor Miss Charlecote sadly, so pray let no one suspect, and I
will come back and tell you to-morrow, by the time you are
dressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Fulmort was so much uplifted by the promise of the grand
secret that she made no more opposition, and Maria and Bertha
hurried in with Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s glove, which, with the
peculiar fidelity of property wilfully lost, had fallen into
their hands while searching for Robert.&nbsp; Both declared they
had seen him on the hill, and clamorously demanded him of
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Her answer, &lsquo;he is not in the forest,
you will not find him,&rsquo; was too conscious fully to have
satisfied the shrewd Bertha, but for the pleasure of discoursing
to the other girls upon double gangers, of whom she had
stealthily read in some prohibited German literature of her
governess&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Leaving her to astonish them, Ph&oelig;be took up a position
near Miss Charlecote, who was talking to the good
matronly-looking Lady Raymond, and on the first opportunity
offered herself as a companion.&nbsp; On the way home, Honor,
much pleased, was proposing to find Owen, and walk through a
beautiful and less frequented forest path, when she saw her own
carriage coming up with that from Beauchamp, and lamented the
mistake which must take her away as soon as Owen could be
found.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ventured to order it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;I thought you might prefer it.&nbsp; Owen is gone.&nbsp;
He left a message with me for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Experience of former blows taught Honora to ask no questions,
and to go through the offices of politeness as usual.&nbsp; But
Lady Raymond, long a friend of hers, though barely acquainted
with Mrs. Fulmort, and never having seen Ph&oelig;be before,
living as she did on the opposite side of the county, took a
moment for turning round to the young girl, and saying with a
friendly motherly warmth, far from mere curiosity, &lsquo;I am
sure you have bad news for Miss Charlecote.&nbsp; I see you
cannot speak of it now, but you must promise me to send to
Moorcroft, if Sir John or I can be of any use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could only give a thankful grasp of the kind
hand.&nbsp; The Raymonds were rather despised at home for plain
habits, strong religious opinions, and scanty fortunes, but she
knew they were Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s great friends and
advisers.</p>
<p>Not till the gay crowd had been left behind did Honor turn to
Ph&oelig;be, and say gently, &lsquo;My dear, if he is gone off in
any foolish way, you had better tell me at once, that something
may be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is gone with Robert,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bertha did really see Robert.&nbsp; He had made a sad
discovery, and came for Owen.&nbsp; Do you remember that pretty
schoolmistress at Wrapworth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never had Ph&oelig;be seen such a blanched face and dilated
eyes as were turned on her, with the gasping words,
&lsquo;Impossible! they would not have told you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>&lsquo;They were obliged,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;they had to hurry for the train, for she is very ill
indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor leant back with folded hands and closed eyes, so that
Ph&oelig;be almost felt as if she had killed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
suppose Robert was right to fetch him,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;but their telling you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen told me he fancied Robert had done so,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;and called out to me something about family
claims, and a married man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married!&rsquo; cried Honora, starting forward.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure,&rsquo; repeated Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;he
desired me to tell you I was to say he knew he was unpardonable,
but he had suffered a great deal, and he was grieved at the
sorrow you would feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having faithfully discharged her message, Ph&oelig;be could
not help being vexed at the relenting &lsquo;Poor
fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor was no longer confounded, as at the first sentences, and
though still cast down, was more relieved than her young friend
could understand, asking all that had passed between the young
men, and when all had been told, leaning back in silence until,
when almost at home, she laid her hand on Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
arm, and said, &lsquo;My child, never think yourself safe from
idols.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She then sought her own room, and Ph&oelig;be feared that her
presence was intrusive, for she saw her hostess no more till
teatime, when the wan face and placid smile almost made her weep
at first, then wonder at the calm unconstrained manner in which
her amusement was provided for, and feel ready to beg not to be
treated like a child or a stranger.&nbsp; When parting for the
night, however, Honor tenderly said, &lsquo;Thanks, my dear, for
giving up the evening to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only been an oppression to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did me the greatest good.&nbsp; I did not want
discussion; I only wanted kindness.&nbsp; I wish I had you
always, but it is better not.&nbsp; Their uncle was right.&nbsp;
I spoil every one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray do not say so.&nbsp; You have been our great
blessing.&nbsp; If you knew how we wish to comfort
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do comfort me.&nbsp; I can watch Robert realizing
my visions for others, and you, my twilight moon, my autumn
flower.&nbsp; But I must not love you too much,
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; They all suffer for my inordinate
affection.&nbsp; But it is too late to talk.&nbsp; Good night,
sweet one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall you sleep?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, wistfully
lingering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t enter into it enough to be
haunted.&nbsp; Ah! you have never learnt what it is to feel heavy
with trouble.&nbsp; I believe I shall not dwell on it till I know
more.&nbsp; There may be much excuse; she may have been artful,
and at least Owen dealt fairly by her in one respect.&nbsp; I can
better suppose her unworthy than him cruelly
neglectful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In that hope Honor slept, and was not more depressed than
Ph&oelig;be had seen her under Lucilla&rsquo;s desertion.&nbsp;
She put off her<!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>judgment till she should hear more,
went about her usual occupations, and sent Ph&oelig;be home till
letters should come, when they would meet again.</p>
<p>Both heard from Robert by the next post, and his letter to
Miss Charlecote related all that he had been able to collect from
Mrs. Murrell, or from Owen himself.&nbsp; The narrative is here
given more fully than he was able to make it.&nbsp; Edna Murrell,
born with the susceptible organization of a musical temperament,
had in her earliest childhood been so treated as to foster
refined tastes and aspirations, such as disgusted her with the
respectable vulgarity of her home.&nbsp; The pet of the nursery
and school-room looked down on the lodge kitchen and parlour, and
her discontent was a matter of vanity with her parents, as a sign
of her superiority, while plausibility and caution were
continually enjoined on her rather by example than by precept,
and she was often aware of her mother&rsquo;s indulgence of
erratic propensities in religion, unknown either to her father or
his employers.</p>
<p>Unexceptionable as had been her training-school education, the
high cultivation and soundness of doctrine had so acted on her as
to keep her farther aloof from her mother, whose far more
heartfelt religion appeared to her both distasteful and
contemptible, and whose advice was thus cast aside as prejudiced
and sectarian.</p>
<p>Such was the preparation for the unprotected life of a
schoolmistress in a house by herself.&nbsp; Servants and small
tradesfolk were no companions to her, and were offended by her
ladylike demeanour; and her refuge was in books that served but
to increase the perils of sham romance, and in enthusiastic
adoration of the young lady, whose manners apparently placed her
on an equality, although her beauty and musical talents were in
truth only serving as a toy.</p>
<p>Her face and voice had already been thrust on Owen&rsquo;s
notice before the adventure with the bargeman had constituted the
young gentleman the hero of her grateful imagination, and
commenced an intercourse for which his sister&rsquo;s
inconsiderate patronage gave ample opportunities.&nbsp; His head
was full of the theory of fusion of classes, and of the innate
refinement, freshness of intellect, and vigour of perception of
the unsophisticated, at least so he thought, and when he lent her
books, commenting on favourite passages, and talked poetry or
popular science to her, he imagined himself walking in the steps
of those who were asserting the claims of intelligence to
cultivation, and sowing broadcast the seeds of art, literature,
and emancipation.&nbsp; Perhaps he knew not how often he was
betrayed into tokens of admiration, sufficient to inflame such a
disposition as he had to deal with, and if he were aware of his
influence, and her adoration, it idly flattered and amused him,
without thought of the consequences.</p>
<p>On the night when she had fainted at the sight of his <!--
page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>attention to Ph&oelig;be, she was left on his hands in
a state when all caution and reserve gave way, and her violent
agitation fully awakened him to the perception of the
expectations he had caused, the force of the feelings he had
aroused.&nbsp; A mixture of pity, vanity, and affection towards
the beautiful creature before him had led to a response such as
did not disappoint her, and there matters might have rested for
the present, but that their interview had been observed.&nbsp;
Edna, terror-stricken, believing herself irretrievably disgraced,
had thrown herself on his mercy in a frantic condition, such as
made him dread exposure for himself, as well as suspense for her
tempestuous nature.</p>
<p>With all his faults, the pure atmosphere in which he had grown
up, together with the tone of his associates, comparatively free
from the grosser and more hard-hearted forms of vice, had
concurred with poor Edna&rsquo;s real modesty and principle in
obtaining the sanction of marriage, for her flight with him from
the censure of Wrapworth, and the rebukes of her mother.&nbsp;
Throughout, his feeling had been chiefly stirred up by the actual
sight of her beauty, and excited by her fervent passion.&nbsp;
When absent from her, there had been always regrets and
hesitations, such as would have prevailed, save for his
compassion, and dread of the effects of her desperation, both for
her and for himself.&nbsp; The unpardonable manner in which he
knew himself to have acted, made it needful to plunge deeper for
the very sake of concealment.</p>
<p>Yet, once married, he would have been far safer if he had
confessed the fact to his only true friend, since it must surely
come to light some time or other, but he had bred himself up in
the habit of schoolboy shuffling, hiding everything to the last
moment, and he could not bear to be cast off by the Charterises,
be pitied and laughed at by his Oxford friends, nor to risk Honor
Charlecote&rsquo;s favour, perhaps her inheritance.&nbsp; Return
to Oxford the victim of an attachment to a village
schoolmistress!&nbsp; Better never return thither at all, as
would be but too probably the case!&nbsp; No! the secret must be
kept till his first start in life should be secure; and he talked
to Edna of his future curacy, while she fed her fancy with
visions of lovely parsonages and &lsquo;clergymen&rsquo;s
ladies&rsquo; in a world of pensive bliss, and after the
honeymoon in Ireland, promised to wait patiently, provided her
mother might know all.</p>
<p>Owen had not realized the home to which he was obliged to
resign his wife, nor his mother-in-law&rsquo;s powers of
tongue.&nbsp; There were real difficulties in the way of his
visiting her.&nbsp; It was the one neighbourhood in London where
his person might be known, and if he avoided daylight, he became
the object of espial to the disappointed lodgers, who would have
been delighted to identify the &lsquo;Mr. Brook&rsquo; who had
monopolized the object of their admiration.&nbsp; These perils,
the various disagreeables, and especially Mrs. Murrell&rsquo;s
complaints and demands for money, had so much annoyed Owen, who
felt himself the injured party in the <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>connection,
that he had not only avoided the place, but endeavoured to
dismiss the whole humiliating affair from his mind, trying to
hinder himself from being harassed by letters, and when forced to
attend to the representations of the women, sending a few kind
words and promises, with such money as he could spare, always
backed, however, by threats of the consequences of a disclosure,
which he vaguely intimated would ruin his prospects for life.</p>
<p>Little did the thoughtless boy comprehend the cruelty of his
neglect.&nbsp; In the underground rooms of the City
lodging-house, the voluntary prison of the shame-faced,
half-owned wife, the overwrought headache, incidental to her
former profession, made her its prey; nervous fever came on as
the suspense became more trying, and morbid excitement alternated
with torpor and depression.&nbsp; Medical advice was long
deferred, and that which was at last sought was not equal to her
needs.&nbsp; It remained for the physician, summoned by Robert,
in his horror at her delirium, to discover that her brain had
long been in a state of irritation, which had become aggravated
to such a degree that death was even to be desired.&nbsp; Could
she yet survive, it could hardly be to the use of her
intellect.</p>
<p>Robert described poor Owen&rsquo;s impetuous misery, and the
cares which he lavished on the unconscious sufferer, mentioning
him with warmth and tenderness that amazed Honor, from one so
stern of judgment.&nbsp; Nay, Robert was more alive to the
palliations of Owen&rsquo;s conduct than she was herself.&nbsp;
She grieved over the complicated deceit, and resented the cruelty
to the wife with the keen severity of secluded womanhood, unable
to realize the temptations of young-manhood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why could he not have told me?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I could so easily have forgiven him for generous love, if
I alone had been offended, and there had been no falsehood; but
after the way he has used us all, and chiefly that poor young
thing, I can never feel that he is the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, though the heart that knew no guile had been saved from
suffering, the thought of the intimacy that she had encouraged,
and the wishes she had entertained for Ph&oelig;be, filled her
with such dismay, that it required the sight of the innocent,
serene face, and the sound of the happy, unembarrassed voice, to
reassure her that her darling&rsquo;s peace had not been
wrecked.&nbsp; For, though Owen had never overpassed the bounds
of the familiar intercourse of childhood, there had been an
implication of preference in his look and tone; nor had there
been error in the intuition of poor Edna&rsquo;s jealous
passion.&nbsp; Something there was of involuntary reverence that
had never been commanded by the far more beautiful and gifted
girl who had taken him captive.</p>
<p>So great was the shock that Honora moved about mechanically,
hardly able to think.&nbsp; She knew that in time she should
pardon her boy; but she could not yearn to do so till she had
seen him <!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>repent.&nbsp; He had sinned too
deeply against others to be taken home at once to her heart, even
though she grieved over him with deep, loving pity, and sought to
find the original germs of error rather in herself than in
him.</p>
<p>Had she encouraged deceit by credulous trust?&nbsp; Alas!
alas! that should but have taught him generosity.&nbsp; It was
the old story.&nbsp; Fond affection had led her to put herself
into a position to which Providence did not call her, and to
which she was, therefore, unequal.&nbsp; Fond affection had
blinded her eyes, and fostered in its object the very faults most
hateful to her.&nbsp; She could only humble herself before her
Maker for the recurring sin, and entreat for her own pardon, and
for that of the offender with whose sins she charged herself.</p>
<p>And to man she humbled herself by her confession to Captain
Charteris, and by throwing herself unreservedly on the advice of
Mr. Saville and Sir John Raymond, for her future conduct towards
the culprit.&nbsp; If he were suffering now for her rejection of
the counsel of manhood and experience, it was right that they
should deal with him now, and she would try to bear it.&nbsp; And
she also tried as much as possible to soften the blow to Lucilla,
who was still abroad with her cousins.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<blockquote><p>A little grain of conscience made him sour.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Tennyson</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;A penny for your thoughts, Cilly,&rsquo; said Horatia,
sliding in on the slippery boards of a great bare room of a
lodging-house at the celebrated Spa of Spitzwasserfitzung.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My thoughts?&nbsp; I was trying to recollect the third
line of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sated at home, of wife and children
tired,<br />
Sated abroad, all seen and naught admired.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me, how grand!&nbsp; Worth twopence.&nbsp; So
good how Shakspeare, as the Princess Ottilie would
say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twopence for its sincerity!&nbsp; It is not for your
sake that I am not in Old England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor for that of the three flaxen-haired princesses,
with religious opinions to be accommodated to those of the
crowned heads they may marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sick of the three, and their raptures.&nbsp;
I wish I was as ignorant as you, and that Shakspeare had never
been read at the Holt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a sudden change.&nbsp; I thought
Spitzwasserfitzung and its princesses had brought halcyon
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Halcyon days will never come till we get
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which Lolly will never do.&nbsp; She passes for
somebody here, and will never endure Castle Blanch
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make Owen come and take me
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Rashe, seriously, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
bring Owen here.&nbsp; If Lolly likes to keep Charles where
gaming is man&rsquo;s sole resource, don&rsquo;t run Owen into
that scrape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a despicable set you are!&rsquo; sighed
Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder why I stay with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might almost as well be gone,&rsquo; said
Ratia.&nbsp; &lsquo;You aren&rsquo;t half so useful in keeping
things going as you were once; and you won&rsquo;t be ornamental
long, if you let your spirits be so uncertain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray how is that to be helped?&nbsp; No,
don&rsquo;t come out with that stupid thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Commonplace because it is reasonable.&nbsp; You would
have plenty of excitement in the engagement, and then no end of
change, and settle down into a blooming little matron, with all
the business of the world on your hands.&nbsp; You have got him
into excellent training by keeping him dangling so long; and it
is the only chance of keeping your looks or your temper.&nbsp; By
the time I come and stay with you, you&rsquo;ll be so agreeable
you won&rsquo;t know yourself&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blessings on that hideous post-horn for stopping your
mouth!&rsquo; cried Lucilla, springing up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not that
letters ever come to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Letters and Mr. and Mrs. Charteris all entered together, and
Rashe was busy with her own share, when Lucilla came forward with
a determined face, unlike her recent listless look, and said,
&lsquo;I am wanted at home.&nbsp; I shall start by the diligence
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How now?&rsquo; said Charles.&nbsp; &lsquo;The old lady
wanting you to make her will?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Lucilla, with dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
brother&rsquo;s wife is very ill.&nbsp; I must go to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she demented?&rsquo; asked Charles, looking at his
sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Raving,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has
been so the whole morning.&nbsp; I shall cut off her hair, and
get ice for her head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell simple truth,&rsquo; returned Cilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here is a letter from Honor Charlecote, solving the two
mysteries of last summer.&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s companion, who Rashe
would have it was Jack Hastings&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! married, then!&nbsp; The cool hand!&nbsp; And
verily, but that Cilly takes it so easily, I should imagine it
was her singing prodigy&mdash;eh?&nbsp; It was, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Absurd idiot!&rsquo; exclaimed Charles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There, he is done for now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; drawled Elo&iuml;sa; &lsquo;one never could
notice a low person like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is my sister, remember!&rsquo; cried Lucilla, with
stamping foot and flashing eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cunning rogue!&rsquo; continued Horatia.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How did he manage to give no suspicion?&nbsp; Oh! what
fun!&nbsp; No wonder she looked green and yellow when he was
flirting with the little Fulmort!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s hear all,
Cilly&mdash;how, when, and where?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&lsquo;At the Registrar&rsquo;s, at R---, July 14th,
1854,&rsquo; returned Lucilla, with defiant gravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last July!&rsquo; said Charles.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha! the
young donkey was under age&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t consent of
guardian.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe the marriage will hold
water.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write to Stevens this minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that would be luck!&rsquo; exclaimed Rashe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much better than he deserves,&rsquo; added Charles,
&lsquo;to be such a fool as to run into the noose and marry the
girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla was trembling from head to foot, and a light gleamed
in her eyes; but she spoke so quietly that her cousins did not
apprehend her intention in the question&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean what you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; said Charles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of the law, and some of the big-wigs
are very cantankerous about declaring an affair of this sort
null; but I imagine there is a fair chance of his getting quit
for some annual allowance to her; and I&rsquo;ll do my best, even
if I had to go to London about it.&nbsp; A man is never ruined
till he is married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; returned Lucilla, her lips trembling
with bitter irony.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I know what you all are made
of.&nbsp; We are obliged for your offered exertion, but we are
not inclined to become traitors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilly! I thought you had more sense!&nbsp; You are no
child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a woman&mdash;I feel for womanhood.&nbsp; I am a
sister&mdash;I feel for my brother&rsquo;s honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charles burst into a laugh.&nbsp; Elo&iuml;sa
remonstrated&mdash;&lsquo;My dear, consider the disgrace to the
whole family&mdash;a village schoolmistress!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our ideas differ as to disgrace,&rsquo; said
Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me go, Ratia; I must pack for the
diligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brother and sister threw themselves between her and the
door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you insane, Cilly?&nbsp; What do you mean
should become of you?&nbsp; Are you going to join the
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>, and teach the A B C?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to own my sister while yet there is
time,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;While you are meditating
how to make her a deserted outcast, death is more merciful.&nbsp;
Pining under the miseries of an unowned marriage, she is fast
dying of pressure on the brain.&nbsp; I am going in the hope of
hearing her call me sister.&nbsp; I am going to take charge of
her child, and stand by my brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dying, poor thing!&nbsp; Why did you not tell us
before?&rsquo; said Horatia, sobered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not know it was to save Charles so much <i>kind
trouble</i>,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me go, Rashe;
you cannot detain me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do believe she is delighted,&rsquo; said Horatia,
releasing her.</p>
<p>In truth, she was inspirited by perceiving any door of
escape.&nbsp; Any vivid sensation was welcome in the irksome
vacancy that pursued her in the absence of immediate
excitement.&nbsp; Devoid of the interest of opposition, and of
the bracing changes to the Holt, her intercourse with the
Charterises had become a <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>weariness
and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; Idle foreign life deteriorated
them, and her principle and delicacy suffered frequent offences;
but like all living wilfully in temptation, she seemed under a
spell, only to be broken by an act of self-humiliation to which
she would not bend.&nbsp; Longing for the wholesome atmosphere of
Hiltonbury, she could not brook to purchase her entrance there by
permitting herself to be pardoned.&nbsp; There was one whom she
fully intended should come and entreat her return, and the terms
of her capitulation had many a time been arranged with herself;
but when he came not, though her heart ached after him, pride
still forbade one homeward step, lest it should seem to be in
quest of him, or in compliance with his wishes.</p>
<p>Here, then, was a summons to England&mdash;nay, into his very
parish&mdash;without compromising her pride or forcing her to
show deference to rejected counsel.&nbsp; Nay, in contrast with
her cousins, she felt her sentiments so lofty and generous that
she was filled with the gladness of conscious goodness, so like
the days of her early childhood, that a happy dew suffused her
eyes, and she seemed to hear the voice of old Thames.&nbsp; Her
loathing for the views of her cousins had borne down all
resentment at her brother&rsquo;s folly and Edna&rsquo;s
presumption; and relieved that it was not worse, and full of pity
for the girl she had really loved, Honor&rsquo;s grieved
displeasure and Charles&rsquo;s kind project together made her
the ardent partisan of the young wife.&nbsp; Because Honor
intimated that the girl had been artful, and had forced herself
on Owen, Lucilla was resolved that her favourite had been the
most perfect of heroines; and that circumstance alone should bear
such blame as could not be thrown on Honor herself and the
Wrapworth gossipry.&nbsp; Poor circumstances!</p>
<p>The journey gave her no concern.&nbsp; The way was direct to
Ostend, and Spitzwasserfitzung contained a
&lsquo;<i>pension</i>,&rsquo; which was a great resort of
incipient English governesses, so that there were no difficulties
such as to give her enterprising spirit the least concern.&nbsp;
She refused the escort that Rashe would have pressed upon her,
and made her farewells with quiet resolution.&nbsp; No further
remonstrance was offered; and though each party knew that what
had passed would be a barrier for ever, good breeding preferred
an indifferent parting.&nbsp; There were light, cheery words, but
under the full consciousness that the friendship begun in
perverseness had ended in contempt.</p>
<p>Horatia turned aside with a good-natured &lsquo;Poor child!
she will soon wish herself back.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lucilla, taking her
last glance, sighed as she thought, &lsquo;My father did not like
them.&nbsp; But for Honor, I would never have taken up with
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without misadventure, Lucilla arrived at London Bridge, and
took a cab for Woolstone-lane, where she must seek more exact
intelligence of the locality of those she sought.&nbsp; So long
had her eye been weary of novelty, while her mind was ill at
ease, that even Holborn in the August sun was refreshingly
homelike; and begrimed Queen Anne, &lsquo;sitting in the
sun&rsquo; <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>before St. Paul&rsquo;s, wore a
benignant aspect to glances full of hope and self-approval.&nbsp;
An effort was necessary to recall how melancholy was the occasion
of her journey, and all mournful anticipation was lost in the
spirit of partisanship and patronage&mdash;yes, and in that
pervading consciousness that each moment brought her nearer to
Whittingtonia.</p>
<p>Great was the amaze of good Mrs. Jones, the housekeeper, at
the arrival of Miss Lucy, and equal disappointment that she would
neither eat nor rest, nor accept a convoy to No. 8, Little
Whittington-street.&nbsp; She tripped off thither the instant she
had ascertained the number of the house, and heard that her
brother was there, and his wife still living.</p>
<p>She had formed to herself no image of the scenes before her,
and was entirely unprepared by reflection when she rang at the
door.&nbsp; As soon as she mentioned her name, the little maid
conducted her down-stairs, and she found herself in the
sitting-room, face to face with Robert Fulmort.</p>
<p>Without showing surprise or emotion, or relaxing his grave,
listening air, he merely bowed his head, and held out his
hand.&nbsp; There was an atmosphere of awe about the room, as
though she had interrupted a religious office; and she stood
still in the solemn hush, her lips parted, her bosom
heaving.&nbsp; The opposite door was ajar, and from within came a
kind of sobbing moan, and a low, feeble, faltering voice faintly
singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For men must work, and women must weep,<br
/>
And the sooner &rsquo;tis over, the sooner to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The choking thrill of unwonted tears rushed over Lucilla, and
she shuddered.&nbsp; Robert looked disappointed as he caught the
notes; then placing a seat for Lucilla, said, very low, &lsquo;We
hoped she would waken sensible.&nbsp; Her mother begged me to be
at hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she never been sensible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They hoped so, at one time, last night.&nbsp; She
seemed to know him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert only sighed assent, for again the voice was
heard&mdash;&lsquo;I must get up.&nbsp; Miss Sandbrook wants
me.&nbsp; She says I shan&rsquo;t be afraid when the time comes;
but oh!&mdash;so many, many faces&mdash;all their eyes looking;
and where is he?&mdash;why doesn&rsquo;t he look?&nbsp; Oh! Miss
Sandbrook, don&rsquo;t bring that young lady here&mdash;I
know&mdash;I know it is why he never comes&mdash;keep her
away&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice turned to shrieking sobs.&nbsp; There were sounds of
feet and hurried movements, and Owen came out, gasping for
breath, and his face flushed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
it,&rsquo; he said, with his hands over his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I be of use?&rsquo; asked Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; the nurse can hold her;&rsquo; and he leant his
arms on the mantelpiece, his frame shaken with long-drawn
sobs.&nbsp; He had never even seen his sister, and she was too
much appalled to speak or move.</p>
<p><!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>When the sounds ceased, Owen looked up to listen, and
Robert said, &lsquo;Still no consciousness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, better not.&nbsp; What would she gain by
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be better not, if so ordained,&rsquo; said
Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw! what are last feelings and words?&nbsp; As if a
blighted life and such suffering were not sure of
compensation.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more justice in Heaven than in
your system!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was gone; and Robert with a deep sigh said, &lsquo;I am not
judging.&nbsp; I trust there were tokens of repentance and
forgiveness; but it is painful, as her mother feels it, to hear
how her mind runs on light songs and poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mechanically!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True; and delirium is no criterion of the state of
mind.&nbsp; But it is very mournful.&nbsp; In her occupation, one
would have thought habit alone would have made her ear catch
other chimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla remembered with a pang that she had sympathized with
Edna&rsquo;s weariness of the monotony of hymn and
catechism.&nbsp; Thinking poetry rather dull and tiresome, she
had little guessed at the effect of sentimental songs and volumes
of L. E. L. and the like, on an inflammable mind, when once
taught to slake her thirsty imagination beyond the S.P.C.K.&nbsp;
She did not marvel at the set look of pain with which Robert
heard passionate verses of Shelley and Byron fall from those
dying lips.&nbsp; They must have been conned by heart, and have
been the favourite study, or they could hardly thus recur.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; said Robert, after a time; &lsquo;I
am doing no good here.&nbsp; You will take care of your brother,
if it is over before I return.&nbsp; Where are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My things are in Woolstone-lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant to get him there.&nbsp; I will come back by
seven o&rsquo;clock; but I must go to the school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I go in there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better not.&nbsp; It is a fearful sight, and
you cannot be of use.&nbsp; I wish you could be out of hearing;
but the house is full.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One moment, Robert&mdash;the child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sent to a nurse, when every sound was agony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stepped into the sick room, and brought out Mrs. Murrell,
who began with a curtsey, but eagerly pressed Lucilla&rsquo;s
offered hand.&nbsp; Subdued by sorrow and watching, she was
touchingly meek and resigned, enduring with the patience of real
faith, and only speaking to entreat that Mr. Fulmort would pray
with her for her poor child.&nbsp; Never had Lucilla so prayed;
and ere she had suppressed her tears, ere rising from her knees,
Robert was gone.</p>
<p>She spent the ensuing hours of that summer evening, seated in
the arm-chair, barely moving, listening to the ticking of the
clock, and the thunder of the streets, and at times hearkening to
the sounds in the inner chamber, the wanderings feebler and more
rare, but the fearful convulsions more frequent, seeming, as it
were, to be tearing away the last remnant of life.&nbsp; These
<!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>moments of horror-struck suspense were the only breaks,
save when Owen rushed out unable to bear the sight, and stood,
with hidden face, in such absorption of distress as to be
unconscious of her awe-struck attempts to obtain his attention,
or when Mrs. Murrell came to fetch something, order her maid, or
relieve herself by a few sad words to her guest.&nbsp; Gratified
by the eager sisterly acknowledgment of poor Edna, she touched
Lucilla deeply by speaking of her daughter&rsquo;s fondness for
Miss Sandbrook, grief at having given cause for being thought
ungrateful, and assurances that the secret never could have been
kept had they met the day after the <i>soir&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp;
Many had been the poor thing&rsquo;s speculations how Miss
Sandbrook would receive her marriage, but always with confidence
in her final mercy and justice: and when Lucilla heard of the
prolonged wretchedness, the hope deferred, the evil reports and
suspicions of neighbours and lodgers, the failing health, and
cruel disappointment, and looked round at the dismal little
stifling dungeon where this fair and gifted being had pined and
sunk beneath slander and desertion, hot tears of indignation
filled her eyes, and with fingers clenching together, she said,
&lsquo;Oh that I had known it sooner!&nbsp; Edna was right.&nbsp;
I will be the person to see justice done to her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when left alone she cast about for the most open mode of
proclaiming Edna Murrell her brother&rsquo;s honoured wife, and
her own beloved sister.&nbsp; The more it mortified the
Charterises the better!</p>
<p>By the time Robert came back, the sole change was in the
failing strength, and he insisted on conducting Lucilla to
Woolstone-lane, Mrs. Murrell enforcing his advice so decidedly
that there was no choice.&nbsp; She would not be denied one look
at the sufferer, but what she saw was so miserably unlike the
beautiful creature whom she remembered, that she recoiled,
feeling the kindness that had forbidden her the spectacle, and
passively left the house, still under the chill influence of the
shock.&nbsp; She had tasted nothing since breakfasting on board
the steamer, and on coming into the street the comparative
coolness seemed to strike her through; she shivered, felt her
knees give way, and grasped Robert&rsquo;s arm for support.&nbsp;
He treated her with watchful, considerate solicitude, though with
few words, and did not leave her till he had seen her safe under
the charge of the housekeeper; when, in return for his assurance
that he would watch over her brother, she promised to take food,
and go at once to rest.</p>
<p>Too weary at first to undress, and still thinking that Owen
might be brought to her, she lay back on the couch in her own
familiar little cedar room, feeling as if she recalled the day
through the hazy medium of a dream, and as if she had not been in
contact with Edna, nor Owen, nor Robert, but only with pale
phantoms called by those names.</p>
<p>Robert especially!&nbsp; Engrossed and awe-stricken as she had
<!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>been, still it came on her that something was gone that
to her had constituted Robert Fulmort.&nbsp; Neither the change
of dress, nor even the older and more settled expression of
countenance, made the difference; but the want of that nameless,
hesitating deference which in each word or action formerly seemed
to implore her favour, or even when he dared to censure, did so
under appeal to her mercy.&nbsp; Had he avoided her, she could
have understood it; but his calm, authoritative self-possession
was beyond her, though as yet she was not alarmed, for her mind
was too much confused to perceive that her influence was lost;
but it was uncomfortable, and part of this strange, unnatural
world, as though the wax which she had been used to mould had
suddenly lost its yielding nature and become marble.</p>
<p>Tired out, she at last went to bed, and slept soundly, but
awoke early, and on coming down, found from the housekeeper that
her brother had been brought home at two o&rsquo;clock by Mr.
Fulmort, and had gone to his room at once.&nbsp; All was
over.&nbsp; Lucilla, longing to hear more, set out to see Mrs.
Murrell, before he should come down-stairs.</p>
<p>While the good woman was forced to bestir herself for her
lodgers&rsquo; breakfasts, Lucilla could steal a solitary moment
to gaze on the pallid face to which death had restored much of
its beauty.&nbsp; She pressed her lips on the regal brow, and
spoke half aloud, &lsquo;Edna, Edna Sandbrook, sister Edna, you
should have trusted me.&nbsp; You knew I would see justice done
to you, and I will.&nbsp; You shall lie by my mother&rsquo;s side
in our own churchyard, and Wrapworth shall know that she, whom
they envied and maligned, was Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s wife and my
cherished sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Murrell, with her swimming eyes and stock phrases,
brought far more Christian sentiments to the bed of death.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor, dear love, her father and I little thought it would
end in this, when we used to be so proud of her.&nbsp; We should
have minded that pride is not made for sinners.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain;&rdquo; and the
Lord saw it well that we should be cast down and slanderous lips
opened against us, that so we might feel our trust is in Him
alone!&nbsp; Oh, it is good that even thus she was brought to
turn to Him!&nbsp; But I thank&mdash;oh, I thank Him that her
father never lived to see this day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wept such tears of true thankfulness and resignation, that
Lucilla, almost abashed by the sight of piety beyond her
comprehension, stood silent, till, with a change to the
practical, Mrs. Murrell recovered herself, saying, &lsquo;If you
please, ma&rsquo;am, when had I best come and speak to the young
gentleman?&nbsp; I ought to know what would be pleasing to him
about the funeral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will arrange,&rsquo; said Lucilla; &lsquo;she shall
be buried with my mother and sister in Wrapworth
churchyard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though gratified, Mrs. Murrell demurred, lest it might be
taken ill by the &lsquo;family&rsquo; and by that godly minister
whose kindness and sympathy at the time of Edna&rsquo;s evasion
had made a deep impression; but Lucilla boldly undertook that the
family <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span><i>must</i> like it, and she would
take care of the minister.&nbsp; Nor was the good woman
insensible to the posthumous triumph over calumny, although still
with a certain hankering after Kensal Green as a sweet place,
with pious monuments, where she should herself be laid, and the
Company that did things so reasonable and so handsome.</p>
<p>Lucilla hurried back to fulfil the mission of Nemesis to the
Charterises, which she called justice to Edna, and by the nine
o&rsquo;clock post despatched three notes.&nbsp; One containing
the notice for the <i>Times</i>&mdash;&lsquo;On the 17th instant,
at 8, Little Whittington-street, St. Wulstan&rsquo;s, Edna, the
beloved wife of Owen Charteris Sandbrook, Esq.;&rsquo; another
was to order a complete array of mourning from her dressmaker;
and the third was to the Reverend Peter Prendergast, in the most
simple manner requesting him to arrange for the burial of her
sister-in-law, at 5 P.M. on the ensuing Saturday, indicating the
labourers who should act as bearers, and ending with, &lsquo;You
will be relieved by hearing that she was no other than our dear
Edna, married on the 14th of July, last year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She then beguiled the time with designs for gravestones, until
she became uneasy at Owen&rsquo;s non-appearance, and longed to
go and see after him; but she fancied he might have spent nights
of watching, and thought sleep would be the best means of getting
through the interval which appalled her mind, unused to contact
with grief.&nbsp; Still his delay began to wear her spirits and
expectation, so long wrought up to the meeting; and she was at
least equally restless for the appearance of Robert, wanting to
hear more from him, and above all certain that all her dreary
cravings and vacancy would be appeased by one dialogue with him,
on whatever topic it might be.&nbsp; She wished that she had
obeyed that morning bell at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It would
have disposed of half-an-hour, and she would have met him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For shame,&rsquo; quoth the haughty spirit, &lsquo;now
that has come into my head, I can&rsquo;t go at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her solitude continued till half-past ten, when she heard the
welcome sound of Robert&rsquo;s voice, and flew to meet him, but
was again checked by his irresponsive manner as he asked for
Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not seen him.&nbsp; I do not know whether to
knock, lest he should be asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope he is.&nbsp; He has not been in bed for three
nights.&nbsp; I will go and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was moving to the door without lingering for a word
more.&nbsp; She stopped him by saying, &lsquo;Pray hear first
what I have settled with Mrs. Murrell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She told me,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it
Owen&rsquo;s wish?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It ought to be.&nbsp; It must.&nbsp; Every public
justice must be paid now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it quite well judged, unless it were his strong
desire?&nbsp; Have you considered the feelings of Mr. Prendergast
or your relations?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&lsquo;There is nothing I consider more.&nbsp; If
Charles thinks it more disgraceful to marry a Christian for love
than a Jewess for money, he shall see that we are not of the same
opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never pretend to judge of your motives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mercy, what have I gone and said?&rsquo; ejaculated
Lucilla, as the door closed after him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did I let
it out, and make him think me a vixen?&nbsp; Better than a
hypocrite though!&nbsp; I always professed to show my
worst.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s come to me, that I can&rsquo;t go on so
contentedly?&nbsp; He must hear the Charteris&rsquo; sentiments,
though, that he may not think mine a gratuitous
affront.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her explanation was at her tongue&rsquo;s end, but Robert only
reappeared with her brother, whom he had found dressing.&nbsp;
Owen just greeted his sister, but asked no questions, only
dropping heavily into a chair, and let her bring him his
breakfast.&nbsp; So young was he, still wanting six weeks to
years of discretion; so youthful his appearance in spite of his
size and strength, that it was almost absurd to regard him as a
widower, and expect him to act as a man of mature age and
feeling.&nbsp; There was much of the boy in his excessive and
freely-indulged lassitude, and his half-sullen, half-shy reserve
towards his sister.&nbsp; Knowing he had been in conversation
with Robert, she felt it hard that before her he only leant his
elbows on the table, yawned, and talked of his stiffness, until
his friend rising to leave them, he exerted himself to say,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Fulmort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I must.&nbsp; I leave you to your
sister.&rsquo;&nbsp; (She noted that it was not
&lsquo;Lucy.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, I say, Fulmort, there are things to
settle&mdash;funeral, and all that,&rsquo; he said in a helpless
voice, like a sulky schoolboy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sister has been arranging with Mrs.
Murrell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Owen,&rsquo; said Lucilla, tears glistening in her
eyes, and her voice thrilling with emotion; &lsquo;it is right
and just that she should be with our mother and little Mary at
home; so I have written to Mr. Prendergast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he languidly answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Settle it as you will; only deliver me from the old
woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was in no state for reproaches; but Lucilla was obliged to
bite her lip to restrain a torrent of angry weeping.</p>
<p>At his urgent instance, Robert engaged to return to dinner,
and went, leaving Lucilla with nothing to do but to watch those
heavy slumberings on the sofa and proffer attentions that were
received with the surliness of one too miserable to know what to
do with himself.&nbsp; She yearned over him with a new awakening
of tenderness, longing, yet unable, to console or soothe.&nbsp;
The light surface-intercourse of the brother and sister, each
selfishly refraining from stirring the depths of the
other&rsquo;s mind, rendered them mere strangers in the time of
trouble; and vainly did Lucy gaze wistfully at the swollen
eyelids and flushed cheeks, watch every peevish gesture, and tend
each sullen wish, with pitying sweetness; she could not reach the
inner man, nor touch the aching wound.</p>
<p><!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>Towards evening, Mrs. Murrell&rsquo;s name was brought
in, provoking a fretful injunction from Owen not to let him be
molested with her cant.&nbsp; Lucilla sighed compliance, though
vexed at his egotism, and went to the study, where she found that
Mrs. Murrell had brought her grandson, her own most precious
comforter, whom she feared she must resign &lsquo;to be bred up
as a gentleman as he was, and despise his poor old granny; and
she would say not a word, only if his papa would let her keep him
till he had cut his first teeth, for he had always been tender,
and she could not be easy to think that any one else had the
charge of him.&rsquo;&nbsp; She devoured him with kisses as she
spoke, taking every precaution to keep her profuse tears from
falling on him; and Lucilla, much moved, answered, &lsquo;Oh! for
the present, no one could wish to part him from you.&nbsp; Poor
little fellow!&nbsp; May I take him for a little while to my
brother?&nbsp; It may do him good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cilly had rather have ridden a kicking horse than handled an
infant.&nbsp; She did not think this a prepossessing specimen,
but it was passive.&nbsp; She had always understood from books
that this was the sure means of &lsquo;opening the sealed
fountains of grief.&rsquo;&nbsp; She remembered what little Mary
had been to her father, and in hopes that parental instinct would
make Owen know better what to do with her burden than she did,
she entered the drawing-room, where a little murmuring sound
caused Owen to start up on his elbow, exclaiming, &lsquo;What are
you at?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bring <i>that</i> here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you might wish to see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should I do with him?&rsquo; asked Owen, in the
same glum, childish tone, turning his face inwards as he lay
down.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take it away.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I wretched
enough already to please you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave up the point, much grieved and strongly drawn to the
little helpless one, rejected by his father, misused and cast off
like his mother.&nbsp; Would no one stand up for him?&nbsp; Yes,
it must be her part.&nbsp; She was his champion!&nbsp; She would
set him forth in the world, by her own toil if need were!</p>
<p>Sealing the promise with a kiss, she returned him to his
grandmother, and talked of him as so entirely her personal
concern, that the good woman went home to report to her inquiring
friends that the young lady was ready to &lsquo;hact very
feeling, and very &lsquo;andsome.&rsquo;&nbsp; Probably desirous
to avoid further reference to his unwelcome son and heir, Owen
had betaken himself to the solace of his pipe, and was pacing the
garden with steps now sauntering with depression, now impetuous
with impatience, always moving too much like a caged wild beast
to invite approach.&nbsp; She was disconsolately watching him
from the window, when Mr. Fulmort was admitted.&nbsp; A year ago,
what would he not have given for that unfeigned, simple welcome,
as she looked up with eyes full of tears, saying, &lsquo;Oh,
Robert, it is so grievous to see him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very sad,&rsquo; was the mournful answer.</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>&lsquo;You may be able to help him.&nbsp; He asks for
you, but turns from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has been obliged to rely on me, since we came to
town,&rsquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have been very kind!&rsquo; she warmly
exclaimed.</p>
<p>But he drew back from the effusion, saying, &lsquo;I did no
more than was absolutely necessary.&nbsp; He does not lay himself
open to true comfort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Death never seemed half so miserable before!&rsquo;
cried Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet this poor thing had little to
live for!&nbsp; Was it all poor Honor&rsquo;s tender softening
that took off the edge to our imaginations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not always so mournful!&rsquo; shortly said
Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; even the mother bears it better, and not for want
of heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She <i>is</i> a Christian,&rsquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Owen!&nbsp; It makes me remorseful.&nbsp; I wonder
if I made too light of the line he took; yet what difference
could I have made?&nbsp; Sisters go for so little; and as to
influence, Honor overdid it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, as he made no
reply, &lsquo;Tell me, do you think my acquiescence did
harm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say.&nbsp; Your conscience must decide.&nbsp;
It is not a case for me.&nbsp; I must go to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was deep mortification.&nbsp; Used to have the least hint
of dawning seriousness thankfully cherished and fostered, it was
a rude shock, when most in need of <i>&eacute;panchement du
c&oelig;ur</i> after her dreary day, to be thrown back on that
incomprehensible process of self-examination; and by Robert,
too!</p>
<p>She absolutely did not feel as if she were the same
Lucilla.&nbsp; It was the sensation of doubt on her personal
identity awakened in the good woman of the ballad when her little
dog began to bark and wail at her.</p>
<p>She strove to enliven the dinner by talking of Hiltonbury, and
of Juliana&rsquo;s marriage, thus awakening Owen into life and
talkativeness so much in his light ordinary humour, as to startle
them both.&nbsp; Lucilla would have encouraged it as preferable
to his gloom, but it was decidedly repressed by Robert.</p>
<p>She had to repair to solitary restlessness in the
drawing-room, and was left alone there till so late that Robert
departed after a single cup of tea, cutting short a captious
argument of Owen&rsquo;s about impossibility of proof, and truth
being only true in a sense.</p>
<p>Owen&rsquo;s temper was, however, less morose; and when his
sister was lighting his candle for him at night, kindly said,
&lsquo;What a bore I&rsquo;ve been all day, Lucy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to be with you, dear Owen; I have no one
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s become of Rashe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mention her again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve cut you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have cut them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She related what had passed.</p>
<p><!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>Owen set his face into a frown.&nbsp; &lsquo;Even so,
Charlie; doltishness less pardonable than villainy!&nbsp; You
were right to cut the connection, Lucy; it has been our
curse.&nbsp; So now you will back to poor Honor, and try to make
it up to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going near Honor till she forgives you,
and receives your child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you will be very ridiculous,&rsquo; said Owen,
impatiently.&nbsp; &lsquo;She has no such rancour against me as
you have against her, poor dear; but it is not in the nature of
things that she should pass over this unlucky
performance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it had been such a performance as Charles desired, I
should have said so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw!&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t the chance; and gloss it as
you will, Lucy, there&rsquo;s no disguising it, she <i>would</i>
have it, and I could not help it, but she was neglected, and it
killed her!&rsquo;&nbsp; He brought his hand down on the table
with a heavy thump, which together with the words made his sister
recoil.&nbsp; &lsquo;Could Honor treat me the same after
that?&nbsp; And she not my mother, either!&nbsp; Why had not my
father the sense to have married her?&nbsp; Then I could go to
her and get rid of this intolerable weight!&rsquo; and he groaned
aloud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mother could hardly love you more,&rsquo; said Lucy,
to her own surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you will but go to
here,&mdash;when she sees you so unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of the question,&rsquo; broke in Owen; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t stay here!&nbsp; I would have gone this very night,
but I can&rsquo;t be off till that poor thing&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, to the diggings, somewhere, anywhere, to get away
from it all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Owen, do nothing mad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do anything just now, I tell
you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be in a fright.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t take
French leave of you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find me to-morrow
morning, worse luck.&nbsp; Good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla was doubly glad to have come.&nbsp; Her pride approved
his proposal, though her sisterly love would suffer, and she was
anxious about the child; but dawning confidence was at the least
a relief.</p>
<p>Next morning, he was better, and talked much too like his
ordinary self, but relapsed afterwards for want of employment;
and when a letter was brought to him, left by his wife to be read
after her death, he broke down, and fell into a paroxysm of grief
and despair, which still prevailed when a message came in to ask
admission for Mr. Prendergast.&nbsp; Relieved to be out of sight
of depression that her consolations only aggravated, and hoping
for sympathy and counsel, Lucy hastened to the study with
outstretched hands, and was met with the warmth for which she had
longed.</p>
<p>Still there was disappointment.&nbsp; In participation with
Owen&rsquo;s grief, she had lost sight of his offences, and was
not prepared for <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>any commencement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
Cilla, I came up to talk to you.&nbsp; A terrible business this
of Master Owen&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It breaks one&rsquo;s heart to see him so
wretched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope he is.&nbsp; He ought to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mr. Prendergast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The curate held up both his hands, deprecating her coaxing
piteous look, and used his voice rather loudly to overpower hers,
and say what he had prepared as a duty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, he is your brother, and all that.&nbsp; You
may feel for him what you like.&nbsp; But I must say this: it was
a shameful thing, and a betrayal of confidence, such as it
grieves me to think of in his father&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; I am
sorry for her, poor thing! whom I should have looked after
better; and I am very sorry indeed for you, Cilla; but I must
tell you that to bury the poor girl next to Mrs. Sandbrook, as
your brother&rsquo;s wife, would be a scandal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so loud; he will hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His mild face was unwontedly impatient as he said, &lsquo;I
can see how you gave in to the wish; I don&rsquo;t blame you, but
if you consider the example to the parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After what I told you in my letter, I don&rsquo;t see
the evil of the example; unless it be your <i>esprit de corps</i>
about the registrar, and they could not well have requested you
to officiate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla, you were always saucy, but this is no time for
nonsense.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t defend them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you are of your Squire&rsquo;s
opinion&mdash;that the bad example was in the marrying her at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast looked so much shocked that Lucilla felt a
blush rising, conscious that the tone of the society she had of
late lived with had rendered her tongue less guarded, her cheek
less shamefaced than erst, but she galloped on to hide her
confusion.&nbsp; &lsquo;You were their great cause.&nbsp; If you
had not gone and frightened her, they might have philandered on
all this time, till the whole affair died of its own
silliness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, no one was so much to blame as I.&nbsp; I will
trust no living creature again.&nbsp; My carelessness opened the
way to temptation, and Heaven knows, Lucilla, I have been
infinitely more displeased with myself than with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, so am I with myself, for putting her in his
way.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let us torment ourselves with playing the
game backwards again&mdash;I hate it.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see to
the next.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what I came for.&nbsp; Now, Cilla, though I
would gladly do what I could for poor Owen, just think what work
it will make with the girls at Wrapworth, who are nonsensical
enough already, to have this poor runaway brought back to be
buried as the wife of a fine young gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Edna&rsquo;s history is no encouragement to look
out for fine young gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They will know the fact, and sink the
circumstances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you are so innocent as to think they don&rsquo;t
know!&nbsp; Depend <!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>upon it, every house in Wrapworth
rings with it; and won&rsquo;t it be more improving to have the
poor thing&rsquo;s grave to point the moral?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla, you are a little witch.&nbsp; You always have
your way, but I don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; It is not the right
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not right for Owen to make full compensation?&nbsp;
Mind, it is not Edna Murrell, the eloped schoolmistress, but Mrs.
Sandbrook, whom her husband wishes to bury among his
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor lad, is he much cut up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much that I should hardly dare tell him if you had
refused.&nbsp; He could not bear another indignity heaped on her,
and a wound from you would cut deeper than from any one
else.&nbsp; You should remember in judging him that he had no
parent to disobey, and there was generosity in taking on him the
risk rather than leave her to a broken heart and your tender
mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear his tender mercy has turned out worse than mine;
but I am sorry for all he has brought on himself, poor
lad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I try whether he can see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; I had rather not.&nbsp; You say young Fulmort
attends to him, and I could not speak to him with patience.&nbsp;
Five o&rsquo;clock, Saturday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but that is not all.&nbsp; That poor
child&mdash;Robert Fulmort, you, and I must be
sponsors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla, Cilla, how can I answer how it will be brought
up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some one must.&nbsp; Its father talks of leaving
England, and it will be my charge.&nbsp; Will you not help me?
you who always have helped me.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s grandson;
you cannot refuse him, Mr. Pendy,&rsquo; said she, using their
old childish name for him.</p>
<p>He yielded to the united influence of his rector&rsquo;s
daughter and the memory of his rector.&nbsp; Though no weak man,
those two appeals always swayed him; and Lucilla&rsquo;s air,
spirited when she defended, soft when she grieved, was quite
irresistible; so she gained her point, and felt restored to
herself by the exercise of power, and by making her wonted
impression.&nbsp; Since one little dog had wagged his little
tail, she no longer doubted &lsquo;If I be I;&rsquo; yet this
only rendered her more nervously desirous of obtaining the like
recognition from the other, and she positively wearied after one
of Robert&rsquo;s old wistful looks.</p>
<p>A <i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;te</i> with him was
necessary on many accounts, and she lay in wait to obtain a few
moments alone with him in the study.&nbsp; He complied neither
eagerly nor reluctantly, bowed his head without remark when she
told him about the funeral, and took the sponsorship as a matter
of course.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well; I suppose there is no one else
to be found.&nbsp; Is it your brother&rsquo;s thought?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I feared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Robert, we must take double care for the poor
little thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will do my best,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p><!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&lsquo;Do you know what Owen intends?&rsquo; said
Lucilla, in low, alarmed accents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has told you?&nbsp; It is a wild purpose; but I
doubt whether to dissuade him, except for your sake,&rsquo; he
added, with his first softening towards her, like balm to the
sore spot in her heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind me, I can take care of myself,&rsquo; she
said, while the muscles of her throat ached and quivered with
emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would not detain him to be pitied and
forgiven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not send him away in pride,&rsquo; said Robert,
sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I not humbled enough?&rsquo; she said; and her
drooping head and eye seemed to thrill him with their wonted
power.</p>
<p>One step he made towards her, but checked himself, and said in
a matter-of-fact tone, &lsquo;Currie, the architect, has a
brother, a civil engineer, just going out to Canada to lay out a
railway.&nbsp; It might be an opening for Owen to go as his
assistant&mdash;unless you thought it beneath him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These last words were caused by an uncontrollable look of
disappointment.&nbsp; But it was not the proposal: no; but the
change of manner that struck her.&nbsp; The quiet indifferent
voice was like water quenching a struggling spark, but in a
moment she recovered her powers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Beneath him!&nbsp;
Oh, no.&nbsp; I told you we were humbled.&nbsp; I always longed
for his independence, and I am glad that he should not go
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The work would suit his mathematical and scientific
turn.&nbsp; Then, since you do not object, I will see whether he
would like it, or if it be practicable in case Miss Charlecote
should approve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert seized this opportunity of concluding the
interview.&nbsp; Lucy ran up-stairs for the fierce quarter-deck
walking that served her instead of tears, as an ebullition that
tired down her feelings by exhaustion.</p>
<p>Some of her misery was for Owen, but would the sting have been
so acute had Robert Fulmort been more than the true friend?</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s warning, given in that very room, seemed
engraven on each panel.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you go on as you are
doing now, he does not think it would be right for a
clergyman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Could Lucilla have looked through the floor, she would have
seen Robert with elbows on the window-sill, and hands locked over
his knitted brows; and could she have interpreted his short-drawn
sighs, she would have heard, &lsquo;Poor child! poor child!&nbsp;
It is not coquetry.&nbsp; That was injustice.&nbsp; She loves
me.&nbsp; She loves me still!&nbsp; Why do I believe it only too
late?&nbsp; Why is this trial sent me, since I am bound to the
scheme that precludes my marriage?&nbsp; What use is it to see
her as undisciplined&mdash;as unfit as ever?&nbsp; I know
it!&nbsp; I always knew it.&nbsp; But I feel still a traitor to
her!&nbsp; She had warning!&nbsp; She trusted the power of my
attachment in spite of my judgment!&nbsp; Fickle to her, or a
falterer to my higher pledge?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; I must let her
see the position&mdash;crush any hope&mdash;otherwise I cannot
trust myself, nor deal fairly by her.&nbsp; Heaven help us
both!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they next met, Robert had propounded his Canadian <!--
page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>project, and Owen had caught at it.&nbsp; Idleness had
never been his fault, and he wanted severe engrossing labour to
stun pain and expel thought.&nbsp; He was urgent to know what
standard of attainments would be needful, and finding Robert
ignorant on this head, seized his hat, and dashed out in the
gaslight to the nearest bookseller&rsquo;s for a treatise on
surveying.</p>
<p>Robert was taken by surprise, or he might have gone too.&nbsp;
He looked as if he meditated a move, but paused as Lucy said,
&lsquo;Poor fellow, how glad he is of an object!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May it not be to his better feelings like sunshine to
morning dew?&rsquo; said Robert, sighing.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hear a
very high character of Mr. Currie, and a right-minded, practical,
scientific man may tell more on a disposition like
his&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Than parsons and women,&rsquo; said Lucilla, with a
gleam of her old archness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly so.&nbsp; He must see religion in the world,
not out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all, I have not heard who is this Mr. Currie, and
how you know him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know him through his brother, who is building the
church in Cecily Row.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A church in Cecily Row!&nbsp; St.
Cecilia&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Who is doing it?&nbsp; Honor
Charlecote?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&nbsp; Tell me all about it,&rsquo; said Lucilla,
leaning forward to listen with the eager air of interest which,
when not half so earnest, had been always bewitching.</p>
<p>Poor Robert looked away, and tried to think himself explaining
his scheme to the Archdeacon.&nbsp; &lsquo;The place is in
frightful disorder, filled with indescribable vice and misery,
but there is a shadow of hope that a few may be worked on if
something like a mission can be organized.&nbsp; Circumstances
seemed to mark me out as the person to be at the cost of setting
it on foot, my father&rsquo;s connection with the parish giving
it a claim on me.&nbsp; So I purchased the first site that was in
the market, and the buildings are in progress, chapel, schools,
orphanage, and rooms for myself and two other clergy.&nbsp; When
all the rest is provided for, there will remain about two hundred
and fifty pounds a year&mdash;just enough for three of us, living
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He durst not glance towards her, or he would have seen her
cheek white as wax, and her eye seeking his in dismayed
inquiry.&nbsp; There was a pause; then she forced herself to
falter&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I suppose it is very
right&mdash;very grand.&nbsp; It is settled?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Archdeacon has seen the plans, the Bishop has
consented.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Long and deep was the silence that fell on both.</p>
<p>Lucilla knew her fate as well as if his long coat had been a
cowl.&nbsp; She would not, could not feel it yet.&nbsp; She must
keep up appearances, so she fixed her eyes steadily on the
drawing her idle hands were perpetrating on the back of a letter,
and appeared absorbed in shading a Turk&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>If Robert&rsquo;s motives had not been unmixed, if his zeal
had <!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>been alloyed by temper, or his
self-devotion by undutifulness; if his haste had been
self-willed, or his judgment one-sided, this was an hour of
retribution.&nbsp; Let her have all her faults, she was still the
Lucy who had flown home to him for comfort.&nbsp; He felt as if
he had dashed away the little bird that had sought refuge in his
bosom.</p>
<p>Fain would he have implored her pardon, but for the stern
resolution to abstain from any needless word or look, such as
might serve to rivet the affection that ought to be withdrawn;
and he was too manly and unselfish to indulge in discussion or
regret, too late as it was to change the course to which he had
offered himself and his means.&nbsp; To retract would have been a
breach of promise&mdash;a hasty one, perhaps, but still an
absolute vow publicly made; and in all his wretchedness he had at
least the comfort of knowing the present duty.</p>
<p>Afraid of last words, he would not even take leave until Owen
came in upon their silence, full of animation and eagerness to
see how far his knowledge would serve him with the book that he
had brought home.&nbsp; Robert then rose, and on Owen&rsquo;s
pressing to know when he might see the engineer, promised to go
in search of him the next day, but added that they must not
expect to see himself till evening, since it would be a busy
day.</p>
<p>Lucilla stood up, but speech was impossible.&nbsp; She was in
no mood to affect indifference, yet she could neither be angry
nor magnanimous.&nbsp; She seemed to have passed into a fresh
stage of existence where she was not yet at home; and in the same
dreamy way she went on drawing Red Indians, till by a sudden
impulse she looked up and said, &lsquo;Owen, why should not I
come out with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was intent on a problem, and did not hear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, take me with you; I will make a home for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, let me come to Canada, and take care of you and
your child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He burst out laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well done, Cilly; that
beats all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I likely to be in play?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If not, you are crazy.&nbsp; As if a man could go
surveying in the backwoods with a woman and a brat at his
heels!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucy&rsquo;s heart seemed to die within her.&nbsp; Nothing was
left to her: hopes and fears were alike extinct, and life a waste
before her.&nbsp; Still and indifferent, she laid her down at
night, and awoke in the morning, wishing still to prolong the
oblivion of sleep.&nbsp; Anger with Robert would have been a
solace, but his dejection forbade this; nor could she resent his
high-flown notions of duty, and deem herself their victim, since
she had slighted fair warning, and repelled his attempts to
address her.&nbsp; She saw no resource save the Holt, now more
hopelessly dreary and distasteful than ever, and she shrank both
from writing to Honor, or ending her tantalizing intercourse with
Robert.&nbsp; To <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>watch over her brother was her only
comfort, and one that must soon end.</p>
<p>He remained immersed in trigonometry, and she was glad he
should be too much engrossed for the outbreaks of remorseful
sorrow that were so terrible to witness, and carefully guarded
him from all that could excite them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Murrell brought several letters that had been addressed
to him at her house, and as Lucilla conveyed them to him, she
thought their Oxford post-marks looked suspicious, especially as
he thrust them aside with the back of his hand, returning without
remark to A B and C D.</p>
<p>Presently a person asked to speak with Mr. Sandbrook; and
supposing it was on business connected with the funeral, Lucilla
went to him, and was surprised at recognizing the valet of one of
the gentlemen who had stayed at Castle Blanch.&nbsp; He was
urgent to see Mr. Sandbrook himself; but she, resolved to avert
all annoyances, refused to admit him, offering to take a
message.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was it from his master?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; In fact, I have left his
lordship&rsquo;s service,&rsquo; he said, hesitating.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In point of fact I am the principal.&nbsp; There was a
little business to be settled with the young gentleman when he
came into his fortune; and understanding that such was the case,
since I heard of him as settled in life, I have brought my
account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mistake the person.&nbsp; My brother has come into
no fortune, and has no expectation of any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; exclaimed the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I always understood that Mr. Owen Charteris Sandbrook was
heir to a considerable property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only this, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;that I hold a bond from
that gentleman for the payment of &pound;600 upon the death of
Miss Honora Charlecote, of the Holt, Hiltonbury, whose property I
understood was entailed on him.&rsquo;&nbsp; His tone was still
respectful, but his hand shook with suppressed rage, and his eye
was full of passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote is not dead,&rsquo; steadily answered
Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is in perfect health, not fifty years
old, and her property is entirely at her own disposal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Either the man&rsquo;s wrath was beyond control, or he thought
it his interest to terrify the lady, for he broke into angry
complaints of being swindled, with menaces of exposure; but
Lucilla, never deficient in courage, preserved ready thought and
firm demeanour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better take care,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My brother is under age, and not liable.&nbsp; If you
should recover what you have lent him, it can only be from our
sense of honesty.&nbsp; Leave me your address and a copy of the
bond, and I give you my word that you shall receive your
due.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The valet, grown rich in the service of a careless master, and
richer by money-lending transactions with his master&rsquo;s
friends, <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>knew Miss Sandbrook, and was aware
that a lady&rsquo;s word might be safer than a
spendthrift&rsquo;s bond.&nbsp; He tried swaggering, in the hope
of alarming her into a promise to fulfil his demand
uninvestigated; but she was on her guard; and he, reflecting that
she must probably apply to others for the means of paying, gave
her the papers, and freed her from his presence.</p>
<p>Freed her from his presence!&nbsp; Yes, but only to leave her
to the consciousness of the burthen of shame he had brought
her.&nbsp; She saw why Owen thought himself past pardon.&nbsp;
Speculation on the death of his benefactress!&nbsp; Borrowing on
an inheritance that he had been forbidden to expect.&nbsp;
Double-dyed deceit and baseness!&nbsp; Yesterday, she had said
they were humbled enough.&nbsp; This was not humiliation, it was
degradation!&nbsp; It was far too intolerable for standing still
and feeling it.&nbsp; Lucilla&rsquo;s impetuous impulses always
became her obstinate resolutions, and her pride rebounded to its
height in the determination that Owen should leave England in
debt to no man, were it at the cost of all she possessed.</p>
<p>Re-entering the drawing-room, she had found that Owen had
thrust the obnoxious letters into the waste-basket, each unopened
envelope, with the contents, rent down the middle.&nbsp; She sat
down on the floor, and took them out, saying, as she met his eye,
&lsquo;I shall take these.&nbsp; I know what they are.&nbsp; They
are my concern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Folly!&rsquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know I have the good luck to be a minor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is no excuse for dishonesty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at home before you call names,&rsquo; said Owen,
growing enraged.&nbsp; &lsquo;Before you act spy on me, I should
like to know who paid for your fine salmon-fly gown, and all the
rest of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never contracted debts in the trust that my age would
enable me to defraud my creditors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who told you that I did?&nbsp; I tell you, Lucilla,
I&rsquo;ll endure no such conduct from you.&nbsp; No sister has a
right to say such things!&rsquo; and starting up, his furious
stamp shook the floor she sat upon, so close to her that it was
as if the next would demolish her.</p>
<p>She did not move, except to look up all the length of the tall
figure over her into the passion-flushed face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should neither have said nor thought so, Owen,&rsquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should have imputed these debts to mere
heedless extravagance, like other people&rsquo;s&mdash;like my
own, if you please&mdash;save for your own words, and for finding
you capable of such treachery as borrowing on a
<i>post-obit</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked about furiously, stammering interrogations on the
mode of her discovery, and, as she explained, storming at her for
having brought this down on him by the folly of putting
&lsquo;that thing into the <i>Times</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why could
she not have stayed away, instead of meddling where she was not
wanted?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought myself wanted when my brother was in
trouble,&rsquo; <!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>said Lucilla, mournfully, raising
her face, which she had bent between her hands at the first swoop
of the tempest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heaven knows, I had no thought of
spying.&nbsp; I came to stand by your wife, and comfort
you.&nbsp; I only learnt all this in trying to shield you from
intrusion.&nbsp; Oh, would that I knew it not!&nbsp; Would that I
could think of you as I did an hour ago!&nbsp; Oh, Owen, though I
have never shared your fondness for Honor Charlecote, I thought
it genuine; I did not scorn it as fortune-hunting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not!&nbsp; It never was!&rsquo; cried the poor
boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Honor!&nbsp; Poor Honor!&nbsp; Lucy, I doubt if
I could have felt for my mother as I do for her.&nbsp; Oh, if you
could guess how I long for her dear voice in my ears, her soft
hand on my head&mdash;&rsquo; and he sank into his chair, hiding
his face and sobbing aloud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I to believe that, when&mdash;&rsquo; began Lucilla,
slowly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last resource of desperation,&rsquo; cried
Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;What could I do with such a drain upon me; the
old woman for ever clamouring for money, and threatening
exposure?&nbsp; My allowance?&nbsp; Poor Honor meant well, but
she gave me just enough to promote expensive habits without
supplying them.&nbsp; There was nothing to fall back
on&mdash;except the ways of the Castle Blanch folk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Betting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &lsquo;So when it went against me, and people
would have it that I had expectations, it was not for me to
contradict them.&nbsp; It was their business, not mine, to look
out for themselves, and pretty handsomely they have done
so.&nbsp; It would have been a very different percentage if I had
been an eldest son.&nbsp; As it is, my bond is&mdash;what is it
for, Lucy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much do you think I have touched of that?&nbsp; Not
two!&nbsp; Of that, three-fourths went to the harpies I fell in
with at Paris, under Charles&rsquo;s auspices&mdash;and
five-and-twenty there&rsquo;&mdash;pointing in the direction of
Whittington-street.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will the man be satisfied with the two
hundred?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t he wish he may get it?&nbsp; But, Lucy, you
are not to make a mess of it.&nbsp; I give you warning I shall
go, and never be heard of more, if Honor is applied
to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather die than do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not frantic enough to want to do it out of your
own money?&nbsp; I say, give me those papers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and stretched out the powerful hand and arm, which
when only half-grown had been giant-like in struggles with his
tiny sister but she only laid her two hands on the paper, with
just sufficient resistance to make it a matter of strength on his
side.&nbsp; They were man and woman, and what availed his muscles
against her will?&nbsp; It came to parley.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,
Lucy, I have a right to think for you.&nbsp; As your brother, I
cannot permit you to throw your substance to the dogs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As your sister, I cannot allow you to rest
dishonoured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a whit more than any of your chosen friends.&nbsp;
Every <!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>man leaves debts at Oxford.&nbsp;
The extortion is framed on a scale to be unpaid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be!&nbsp; There shall be no stain on the name
that once was my father&rsquo;s, if there be on the whole world
beside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; with some sulkiness, &lsquo;you
won&rsquo;t be content without beggaring me of my trumpery
twenty-five hundred as soon as I am of age?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Your child must live on that.&nbsp;
Only one person can pay your debts without dishonouring you, and
that is your elder sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elder donkey,&rsquo; was the ungrateful answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, what would become of you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d have to
be beholden to Honor for the clothes on your back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not go back to Honor; I shall earn my own
livelihood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucilla, are you distracted, or is it your object to
make me so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only on one condition could I return to the
Holt,&rsquo; said Lucilla, resolutely.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Honor
would freely offer to receive your son, I would go to take care
of him.&nbsp; Except for his sake, I had rather she would
not.&nbsp; I will not go to be crushed with pardon and
obligation, while you are proscribed.&nbsp; I will be
independent, and help to support the boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; muttered Owen to himself, &lsquo;Lucifer
is her patron saint.&nbsp; If I looked forward to anything, it
was to her going home tame enough to make some amends to poor,
dear Sweet Honey, but I might as well have hoped it of the
panther of the wilderness!&nbsp; I declare I&rsquo;ll write to
Honor this minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He drew the paper before him.&nbsp; Lucilla started to her
feet, looking more disgusted and discomfited than by any former
shock.&nbsp; However, she managed to restrain any dissuasion,
knowing that it was the only right and proper step in his power,
and that she could never have looked Robert in the face again had
she prevented the confession; but it was a bitter pill; above
all, that it should be made for her sake.&nbsp; She rushed away,
as usual, to fly up and down her room.</p>

</a></p>
<p>She might have spared herself that agony.&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s
resolution failed him.&nbsp; He could not bring himself to make
the beginning, nor to couple the avowal of his offence with such
presumption as an entreaty for his child&rsquo;s adoption, though
he knew his sister&rsquo;s impulsive obstinacy well enough to be
convinced that she would adhere pertinaciously to this
condition.&nbsp; Faltering after the first line, he recurred to
his former plan of postponing his letter till his plans should be
so far matured that he could show that he would no longer be a
pensioner on the bounty of his benefactress, and that he sought
pardon for the sake of no material advantage.&nbsp; He knew that
Robert had intimated his intention of writing after the funeral,
and by this he would abide.</p>
<p>Late in the evening Robert brought the engineer&rsquo;s
answer, that he had no objection to take out a pupil, and would
provide board, lodging, and travelling expenses; but he required
a considerable premium, and for three years would offer no
salary.&nbsp; <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>His standard of acquirements was
high, but such as rather stimulated than discouraged Owen, who
was delighted to find that an appointment had been made for a
personal interview on the ensuing Monday.</p>
<p>It was evident that if these terms were accepted, the debts,
if paid at all, must come out of Lucilla&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp;
Owen&rsquo;s own portion would barely clothe him and afford the
merest pittance for his child until he should be able to earn
something after his three years&rsquo; apprenticeship.&nbsp; She
trusted that he was convinced, and went up-stairs some degrees
less forlorn for having a decided plan; but a farther discovery
awaited her, and one that concerned herself.</p>
<p>On her bed lay the mourning for which she had sent, tasteful
and expensive, in her usual complete style, and near it an
envelope.&nbsp; It flashed on her that her order had been
dangerously unlimited, and she opened the cover in trepidation,
but what was her dismay at the double, treble, quadruple
foolscap?&nbsp; The present articles were but a fraction to the
dreadful aggregate&mdash;the sum total numbered hundreds!&nbsp;
In a dim hope of error she looked back at the items, &lsquo;Black
lace dress: Dec. 2nd, 1852.&rsquo;&mdash;She understood
all.&nbsp; It dated from the death of her aunt.&nbsp; Previously,
her wardrobe had been replenished as though she had been a
daughter of the house, and nothing had marked the difference;
indeed, the amply provided Horatia had probably intended that
things were to go on as usual.&nbsp; Lucilla had been allowed to
forget the existence of accounts, in a family which habitually
ignored them.&nbsp; Things had gone smoothly; the beautiful
little Miss Sandbrook was an advertisement to her milliners, and
living among wealthy people, and reported to be on the verge of
marriage with a millionaire, there had been no hesitation in
allowing her unlimited credit.</p>
<p>Probably the dressmaker had been alarmed by the long absence
of the family, and might have learnt from the servants how
Lucilla had quitted them, therefore thinking it expedient to
remind her of her liabilities.&nbsp; And not only did the present
spectacle make her giddy, but she knew there was worse
beyond.&nbsp; The Frenchwoman who supplied all extra adornments,
among them the ball-dress whose far bitterer price she was
paying, could make more appalling demands; and there must be
other debts elsewhere, such that she doubted whether her entire
fortune would clear both her brother and herself.&nbsp; What was
the use of thinking?&nbsp; It must be done, and the sooner she
knew the worst the better.&nbsp; She felt very ill-used, certain
that her difficulties were caused by Horatia&rsquo;s inattention,
and yet glad to be quit of an obligation that would have galled
her as soon as she had become sensible of it.&nbsp; It was more
than ever clear that she must work for herself, instead of
returning to the Holt, as a dependent instead of a guest.&nbsp;
Was she humbled enough?</p>
<p>The funeral day began by her writing notes to claim her bills,
and to take steps to get her capital into her own hands.&nbsp;
Owen <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>drowned reflection in geometry, till
it was time to go by the train to Wrapworth.</p>
<p>There Mr. Prendergast fancied he had secured secrecy by
eluding questions and giving orders at the latest possible
moment.&nbsp; The concourse in the church and churchyard was no
welcome sight to him, since he could not hope that the tall
figure of the chief mourner could remain unrecognized.&nbsp;
Worthy man, did he think that Wrapworth needed that sight to
assure them of what each tongue had wagged about for many a
day?</p>
<p>Owen behaved very properly and with much feeling.&nbsp; When
not driving it out by other things, the fact was palpable to him
that he had brought this fair young creature to her grave; and in
the very scenes where her beauty and enthusiastic affection had
captivated him, association revived his earlier admiration, and
swept away his futile apology that she had brought the whole upon
herself.&nbsp; A gust of pity, love, and remorse convulsed his
frame, and though too proud to give way, his restrained anguish
touched every heart, and almost earned him Mr.
Prendergast&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>Before going away, Lucilla privately begged Mr. Prendergast to
come to town on Monday, to help her in some business.&nbsp; It
happened to suit him particularly well, as he was to be in London
for the greater part of the week, to meet some country cousins,
and the appointment was made without her committing herself by
saying for what she wanted him, lest reflection should convert
him into an obstacle instead of an assistant.</p>
<p>The intervening Sunday, with Owen on her hands, was formidable
to her imagination, but it turned out better than she
expected.&nbsp; He asked her to walk to Westminster Abbey with
him, the time and distance being an object to both, and he
treated her with such gentle kindness, that she began to feel
that something more sweet and precious than she had yet known
from him might spring up, if they were not forced to
separate.&nbsp; Once, on rising from kneeling, she saw him
stealthily brushing off his tears, and his eyes were heavy and
swollen, but, softened as she felt, his tone of feelings was a
riddle beyond her power, between their keenness and their
petulance, their manly depth and boyish levity, their remorse and
their recklessness; and when he tried to throw them off, she
could not but follow his lead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; he said, late in the day, &lsquo;we
shall mortify Fulmort if we don&rsquo;t go once to his
shop.&nbsp; Otherwise, I like the article in style.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you should like it at all,&rsquo; said Lucy,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I envy those who, like poor dear Honor, or that little
Ph&oelig;be, can find life in the driest form,&rsquo; said
Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They would say it is our fault that we cannot find
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor would think it her duty to say so.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be has a wider range, and would be more logical.&nbsp;
Is it our fault or misfortune that our ailments can&rsquo;t be
cured by a paring of St. Bridget&rsquo;s <!-- page 299--><a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>thumb-nail,
or by any nostrum, sacred or profane, that really cures their
votaries?&nbsp; I regard it as a misfortune.&nbsp; Those are
happiest who believe the most, and are eternally in a state in
which their faith is working out its effects upon them mentally
and physically.&nbsp; Happy people!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really I think, unless you were one of those happy
people, it is no more consistent in you to go to church than it
would be in me to set up Rashe&rsquo;s globules.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t tell me so, Lucy.&nbsp; There lie all
my best associations.&nbsp; I venerate what the great, the good,
the beloved receive as their blessing and inspiration.&nbsp;
Sometimes I can assimilate myself, and catch an echo of what was
happiness when I was a child at Honor&rsquo;s knee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tears had welled into his eyes again, and he hurried
away.&nbsp; Lucilla had faith (or rather acquiescence) without
feeling.&nbsp; Feeling without faith was a mystery to her.&nbsp;
How much Owen believed or disbelieved she knew not, probably he
could not himself have told.&nbsp; It was more uncertainty than
denial, rather dislike to technical dogma than positive unbelief;
and yet, with his predilections all on the side of faith, she
could not, womanlike, understand why they did not bring his
reason with them. After all, she decided, in her off-hand
fashion, that there was quite enough that was distressing and
perplexing without concerning herself about them!</p>
<p>Style, as Owen called it, was more attended to than formerly
at St. Wulstan&rsquo;s, but was not in perfection.&nbsp; Robert,
whose ear was not his strong point, did not shine in intoning,
and the other curate preached.&nbsp; The impression seemed only
to have weakened that of the morning, for Owen&rsquo;s remarks on
coming out were on the English habit of having overmuch of
everything, and on the superior sense of foreigners in
holiday-making, instead of making a conscience of stultifying
themselves with double and triple church-going.</p>
<p>Cilla agreed in part, but owned that she was glad to have done
with Continental Sundays that had left her feeling good for
nothing all the week, just as she had felt when once, as a child,
to spite Honor, she had come down without saying her prayers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The burthen bound on her conscience by English
prejudice,&rsquo; said her brother, adding &lsquo;that this was
the one oppressive edict of popular theology.&nbsp; It was mere
self-defence to say that the dulness was Puritanical, since the
best Anglican had a cut-and-dried pattern for all
others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely as a fact, Sunday observance is the great
safeguard.&nbsp; All goes to the winds when that is given
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The greater error to have rendered it
grievous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla had no reply.&nbsp; She had not learnt the joy of the
week&rsquo;s Easter-day.&nbsp; It had an habitual awe for her,
not sacred delight; and she could not see that because it was one
point where religion taught the world that it had laws of its
own, <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>besides those of mere experience and
morality, therefore the world complained, and would fain shake
off the thraldom.</p>
<p>Owen relieved her by a voluntary proposal to turn down
Whittington-street, and see the child.&nbsp; Perhaps he had an
inkling that the chapel in Cat-alley would be in full play, and
that the small maid would be in charge; besides, it was
gas-light, and the lodgers would be out.&nbsp; At any rate
softening was growing on him.&nbsp; He looked long and
sorrowfully at the babe in its cradle, and at last,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will never be like her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; and I do not think him like you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact, it is an ugly little mortal,&rsquo; said Owen,
after another investigation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet, it&rsquo;s very
odd, Lucy, I should like him to live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very odd, indeed!&rsquo; she said, nearly laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I own, before ever I saw him, when they said he
would die, I did think it was best for himself, and every one
else.&nbsp; So, maybe, it would; but you see I shouldn&rsquo;t
like it.&nbsp; He will be a horrible expense, and it will be a
great bore to know what to do with him: so absurd to have a son
only twenty years younger than oneself: but I think I like him,
after all.&nbsp; It is something to work for, to make up to him
for what <i>she</i> suffered.&nbsp; And I say, Lucy,&rsquo; his
eye brightened, &lsquo;perhaps Honor will take to him!&nbsp; What
a thing it would be if he turned out all she hoped of me, poor
thing!&nbsp; I would be banished for life, if he could be in my
place, and make it up to her.&nbsp; He might yet have the
Holt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not proposed sending him to her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I am not so cool,&rsquo; he sadly answered;
&lsquo;but she is capable of anything in an impulse of
forgiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spent the evening over his letter; and, in spite of his
sitting with his back towards his sister, she saw more than one
sheet spoilt by large tears unperceived till they dropped, and
felt a jealous pang in recognizing the force of his affection for
Honor.&nbsp; That love and compassion seemed contemptible to her,
they were so inconsistent with his deception and disobedience;
and she was impatient of seeing that, so far as he felt his
errors at all, it was in their aspect towards his
benefactress.&nbsp; His ingratitude towards her touched him in a
more tender part than his far greater errors towards his
wife.&nbsp; The last was so shocking and appalling, that he only
half realized it, and, boy-like, threw it from him; the other
came home to the fondness that had been with him all his life,
and which he missed every hour in his grief.&nbsp; Lucy
positively dreaded his making such submission or betraying such
sorrow as might bring Honora down on them full of pardon and
beneficence.&nbsp; At least, she had the satisfaction of hearing
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve said nothing about you, Cilla.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor the child,&rsquo; he continued, brushing up his
hair from his brow.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I came to go over it, I did
hate myself to such a degree that I could not say a word like
asking a favour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucy was greatly relieved.</p>
<p><!-- page 301--><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
301</span>He looked like himself when he came down to breakfast
exhilarated by the restoration to activity, and the opening of a
new path, though there was a subdued, grave look on his young
brow not unsuited to his deep mourning.</p>
<p>He took up his last evening&rsquo;s production, looked at it
with some satisfaction, and observed, &lsquo;Sweet old
honey!&nbsp; I do hope that letter may be a little comfort to her
good old heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he told that he had been dreaming of her looking into the
cradle, and he could not tell whether it were himself or the boy
that he had seen sitting on a haycock at Hiltonbury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who knows but it may be a good omen,&rsquo; said he in
his sanguine state.&nbsp; &lsquo;You said you would go to her, if
she took the child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not say I would not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t make difficulties; pray don&rsquo;t,
Lucilla.&nbsp; I want nothing for myself; but if I could see you
and the child at the Holt, and hear her dear voice say one word
of kindness, I could go out happy.&nbsp; Imagine if she should
come to town!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla had no mind to imagine any such thing.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<blockquote><p>An upper and a lower spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee, to all are given:<br />
They mingle not, apart they gleam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The joys of earth, of heaven on high;<br />
God grant thee grace to choose the spring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before the nether spring is dry.&mdash;M.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;One moment, Ph&oelig;be, I&rsquo;ll walk a little way
with you;&rsquo; and Honor Charlecote, throwing on bonnet and
scarf, hurried from the drawing-room where Mrs. Saville was
working.</p>
<p>In spite of that youthful run, and girlish escape from
&lsquo;company&rsquo; to a confidante, the last fortnight had
left deep traces.&nbsp; Every incipient furrow had become
visible, the cheeks had fallen, the eyes sunk, the features grown
prominent, and the auburn curls were streaked with silver threads
never previously perceptible to a casual eye.&nbsp; While
languid, mechanical talk was passing, Ph&oelig;be had been
mourning over the change; but she found her own Miss Charlecote
restored in the freer manner, the long sigh, the tender grasp of
the arm, as soon as they were in the open air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; almost in a whisper, &lsquo;I have
a letter from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be pressed her arm, and looked her sympathy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a nice letter,&rsquo; added Honor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor fellow! he has suffered so much.&nbsp; Should you
like to see it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen had not figured to himself what eyes would peruse his
letter; but Honor was in too much need of sympathy to withhold
the sight from the only person who she could still hope would be
touched.</p>
<p><!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>&lsquo;You see he asks nothing, nothing,&rsquo; she
wistfully pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only pardon!&nbsp; Not to come
home; nor anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; surely, that is real contrition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely, surely it is: yet they are not
satisfied&mdash;Mr. Saville and Sir John.&nbsp; They say it is
not full confession; but you see he does refer to the rest.&nbsp;
He says he has deeply offended in other ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not know.&nbsp; I thought your brother had told
you.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Robert <i>is</i> his friend.&nbsp;
Mr. Saville went and found it out.&nbsp; It was very right of
him, I believe.&nbsp; Quite right I should know;
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Miss Charlecote, it has pained you
terribly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is what young men do; but I did not expect it of
him.&nbsp; Expensive habits, debts, I could have borne,
especially with the calls for money his poor wife must have
caused; but I don&rsquo;t know how to believe that he gave
himself out as my heir, and obtained credit on that
account&mdash;a bond to be paid on my death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was too much shocked to answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as Mr. Saville heard of these troubles,&rsquo;
continued Honor, &lsquo;as, indeed, I put all into his hands, he
thought it right I should know all.&nbsp; He went to Oxford,
found out all that was against poor Owen, and then proceeded to
London, and saw the lawyer in whose hands Captain Charteris had
left those children&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; He was very glad to
see Mr. Saville, for he thought Miss Sandbrook&rsquo;s friends
ought to know what she was doing.&nbsp; So it came out that
Lucilla had been to him, insisting on selling out nearly all her
fortune, and paying off with part of it this horrible
bond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is paying his debts, rather than let you hear of
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And <i>they</i> are very angry with him for permitting
it; as if he or anybody else had any power to stop Lucy!&nbsp; I
know as well as possible that it is she who will not let him
confess and make it all open with me.&nbsp; And yet, after this,
what right have I to say I <i>know</i>?&nbsp; How little I ever
knew that boy!&nbsp; Yes, it is right it should be taken out of
my hands&mdash;my blindness has done harm enough already; but if
I had not bound myself to forbear, I could not help it, when I
see the Savilles so much set against him.&nbsp; I do not know
that they are more severe in action than&mdash;than perhaps they
ought to be, but they will not let me pity him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They ought not to dictate to you,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, indignantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dictate!&nbsp; Oh, no, my dear.&nbsp; If you could only
hear his compliments to my discretion, you would know he was
thinking all the time there is no fool like an old fool.&nbsp;
No, I don&rsquo;t complain.&nbsp; I have been wilful, and weak,
and blind, and these are the fruits!&nbsp; It is right that
others should judge for him, and I deserve that they should come
and guard me; though, when I think of such untruth throughout, I
don&rsquo;t feel as if there were danger of my ever being more
than sorry for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>&lsquo;It is worse than the marriage,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There might have been generous risk in that.&nbsp; This
was&mdash;oh, very nearly treachery!&nbsp; No wonder Lucy tries
to hide it!&nbsp; I hope never to say a word to her to show that
I am aware of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is coming home, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must, since she has broken with the Charterises;
but she has never written.&nbsp; Has Robert mentioned
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never; he writes very little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I long to know how it is with him.&nbsp; Now that he
has signed his contract, and made all his arrangements, he cannot
retract; but&mdash;but we shall see,&rsquo; said Honor, with one
gleam of playful hope.&nbsp; &lsquo;If she should come home to me
ready to submit and be gentle, there might be a chance yet.&nbsp;
I am sure he is poor Owen&rsquo;s only real friend.&nbsp; If I
could only tell you half my gratitude to him for it!&nbsp; And I
will tell you what Mr. Saville has actually consented to my
doing&mdash;I may give Owen enough to cover his premium and
outfit; and I hope that may set him at ease in providing for his
child for the present from his own means, as he ought to
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little thing! what will become of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He and his sister must arrange,&rsquo; said Honor,
hastily, as if silencing a yearning of her own.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do
not need the Savilles to tell me I must not take it off their
hands.&nbsp; The responsibility may be a blessing to him, and it
would be wrong to relieve him of a penalty in the natural course
of Providence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, now you have put it into my head to think what a
pleasure it would be to you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done enough for my own pleasure,
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Had you only seen that boy when I had him
first from his father, and thought him too much of the angel to
live!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and Honor at length exclaimed,
&lsquo;I see the chief reason the Savilles came here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To hinder my seeing him before he goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it would be sad pain to you,&rsquo; cried
Ph&oelig;be, deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He must not come here; but
since I have had this letter, I have longed to go up for one day,
see him, and bring Lucy home.&nbsp; Mr. Saville might go with
me.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t favour it, Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; Would
Robert?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert would like to have Owen comforted,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, slowly; &lsquo;but not if it only made it worse pain
for you.&nbsp; Dear Miss Charlecote, don&rsquo;t you think, if
the worst had been the marriage, you would have tried everything
to comfort him? but now that there is this other horrid thing,
this presuming on your kindness, it seems to me as if you could
not bear to see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I think of their enmity and his sorrow, I feel
drawn thither; but when this deception comes before me, I had
rather not look in his face again.&nbsp; If he petted me I should
think he was taking me in again.&nbsp; He has Robert, he has his
sister, and <!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>I have promised to let Mr. Saville
judge.&nbsp; I think Mr. Saville would let me go if Robert said I
ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be fondled her, and left her relieved by the
outpouring.&nbsp; Poor thing! after mistakes which she supposed
egregious in proportion to the consequences, and the more so
because she knew her own good intentions, and could not
understand the details of her errors, it was an absolute rest to
delegate her authority, even though her affections revolted
against the severity of the judge to whom she had delivered
herself and her boy.</p>
<p>One comfort was that he had been the adviser chosen for her by
Humfrey.&nbsp; In obeying him, she put herself into
Humfrey&rsquo;s hands; and remembering the doubtful approval with
which her cousin had regarded her connection with the children,
and his warnings against her besetting sin, she felt as if the
whole was the continuation of the mistake of her life, her
conceited disregard of his broad homely wisdom, and as if the
only atonement in her power was to submit patiently to Mr.
Saville&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>And in truth his measures were not harsh.&nbsp; He did not
want to make the young man an outcast, only to prevent advantage
being taken of indulgence which he overrated.&nbsp; It was rather
his wife who was oppressive in her desire to make Miss Charlecote
see things in a true light, and teach her, what she could never
learn, to leave off loving and pitying.&nbsp; Even this was
perhaps better for her than a solitude in which she might have
preyed upon herself, and debated over every step in conscious
darkness.</p>
<p>Before her letter was received, Owen had signed his agreement
with the engineer, and was preparing to sail in a
fortnight.&nbsp; He was disappointed and humiliated that Honor
should have been made aware of what he had meant to conceal, but
he could still see that he was mercifully dealt with, and was
touched by, and thankful for, the warm personal forgiveness,
which he had sense enough to feel, even though it brought no
relaxation of the punishment.</p>
<p>Lucy was positively glad of the non-fulfilment of the
condition that would have taken her back to the Holt; and without
seeing the letter, had satisfaction in her resentment at Honor
for turning on Owen vindictively, after having spoilt him all his
life.</p>
<p>He silenced her summarily, and set out for his
preparations.&nbsp; She had already carried out her project of
clearing him of his liabilities.&nbsp; Mr. Prendergast had
advised her strongly to content herself with the <i>post
obit</i>, leaving the rest to be gradually liquidated as the
means should be obtained; but her wilful determination was beyond
reasoning, and by tyrannical coaxing she bent him to her will,
and obliged him to do all in which she could not be
prominent.</p>
<p>Her own debts were a sorer subject, and she grudged the vain
expenses that had left her destitute, without even the power of
writing grandly to Horatia to pay off her share of the foreign
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>expenditure.&nbsp; She had, to Mr. Prendergast&rsquo;s
great horror, told him of her governess plan, but had proceeded
no further in the matter than studying the advertisements, until
finding that Honor only invited her, and not her nephew, home to
the Holt, she proceeded to exhale her feelings by composing a
sentence for the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;As Governess, a
Lady&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Prendergast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reddening, and abruptly hasty, the curate entered, and sitting
down without a word, applied himself to cutting his throat with
an ivory paper-knife.&nbsp; Lucilla began to speak, but at her
first word, as though a spell were broken, he exclaimed,
&lsquo;Cilly, are you still thinking of that ridiculous
nonsense?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going out as a governess?&nbsp; Look there;&rsquo; and
she held up her writing.</p>
<p>He groaned, gave himself a slice under each ear, and viciously
bit the end of the paper-knife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going to recommend me?&rsquo; she said, with a
coaxing look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I think it a monstrous thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you know of a place, and will help me to it!&rsquo;
cried she, clapping her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear good Mr. Pendy,
always a friend in need!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you will have it so.&nbsp; It is not so bad as
strangers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s George&rsquo;s wife come to town
to see a governess for little Sarah, and she won&rsquo;t
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I do?&rsquo; asked Lucilla, with a droll shake of
her sunny hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I know you would vouch
for me as tutoress to all the Princesses; able to teach the
physical sciences, the guitar, and Arabic in three lessons; but
if Mrs. Prendergast be the woman I imagine, much she will believe
you.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t they inordinately clever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little Sarah is&mdash;let me see&mdash;quite a
child.&nbsp; Her father did teach her, but he has less time in
his new parish, and they think she ought to have more
accomplishment, polish, and such like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And imagine from the specimen before them that I must
be an adept at polishing Prendergasts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Cilla, do be serious.&nbsp; Tell me if all this
meant nothing, and I shall be very glad.&nbsp; If you were in
earnest, I could not be so well satisfied to see you anywhere
else.&nbsp; You would find Mrs. Prendergast quite a mother to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only one girl!&nbsp; I wanted a lot of riotous boys,
but beggars must not be choosers.&nbsp; This is just
right&mdash;people out of the way of those who knew me in my
palmy days, yet not absolute strangers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was what induced me&mdash;they are so much
interested about you, Cilla.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have made a fine heroic story.&nbsp; I should
not wonder if it all broke down when the parties met.&nbsp; When
am I to be trotted out for inspection?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I told her if I found you really intended it, and
had <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>time, I would ask you to drive to
her with me this morning, and then no one need know anything
about it,&rsquo; he said, almost with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; cried Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It will be settled before Owen turns up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
get ready this instant.&nbsp; I say,&rsquo; she added at the
door, &lsquo;housemaids always come to be hired minus crinoline
and flowers, is it the same with governesses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla, how can you?&rsquo; said her friend, excessively
distressed at the inferior position, but his depression only
inspired her with a reactionary spirit of mischief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crape is inoffensive, but my hair!&nbsp; What shall I
do with it?&nbsp; Does Mrs. Prendergast hold the prejudice
against pretty governesses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She would take Venus herself if she talked no nonsense;
but I don&rsquo;t believe you are in earnest,&rsquo; growled the
curate, angry at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is encouragement!&rsquo; cried Lucilla, flying off
laughing that she might hide from herself her own nervousness and
dismay at this sudden step into the hard verity of
self-dependence.</p>
<p>She could not stop to consider what to say or do, her refuge
was always in the impromptu, and she was far more bent on forcing
Mr. Prendergast to smile, and distracting herself from her one
aching desire that the Irish journey had never been, than of
forming any plan of action.&nbsp; In walking to the cabstand they
met Robert, and exchanged greetings; a sick faintness came over
her, but she talked it down, and her laugh sounded in his ears
when they had passed on.</p>
<p>Yet when the lodgings were reached, the sensation recurred,
her breath came short, and she could hardly conceal her
trembling.&nbsp; No one was in the room but a lady who would have
had far to seek for a governess less beautiful than
herself.&nbsp; Insignificance was the first idea she inspired,
motherliness the second, the third that she was a perfect lady,
and a sensible woman.&nbsp; After shaking Lucilla kindly by the
hand, and seating her on the sofa, she turned to her cousin,
saying, &lsquo;Sarah and her papa are at the National Gallery, I
wish you would look for them, or they will never be in time for
luncheon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Luncheon is not for an hour and a half.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is twenty minutes&rsquo; walk, and they will
forget food and everything else unless you keep them in
order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go presently;&rsquo; but he did not move,
only looking piteous while Mrs. Prendergast began talking to
Lucilla about the pictures, until she, recovering, detected the
state of affairs, and exclaimed with her ready grace and
abruptness, &lsquo;Now, Mr. Prendergast, don&rsquo;t you see how
much you are in the way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A plain truth, Peter,&rsquo; said his cousin,
laughing.</p>
<p>Lucy stepped forward to him, saying affectionately,
&lsquo;Please go; you can&rsquo;t help me, and I am sure you may
trust me with Mrs. Prendergast;&rsquo; and she stretched out a
hand to the lady with an irresistible child-like gesture of
confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you may, Peter?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Prendergast, <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>holding the hand; &lsquo;you shall
find her here at luncheon.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t do anything to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good curate groaned himself off, and Lucy felt so much
restored that she had almost forgotten that it was not an
ordinary call.&nbsp; Indeed she had never yet heard a
woman&rsquo;s voice that thus attracted and softened her.&nbsp;
Mrs. Prendergast needed not to be jealous of Venus, while she had
such tenderness in her manner, such winning force in her
tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was well done,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Talking would have been impossible while he sat looking
on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid he has given far too good an account of
me,&rsquo; said Lucy, in a low and trembling voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His account comes from one who has known you from
babyhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And spoilt me from babyhood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Sarah knows what Cousin Peter can do in that
line.&nbsp; He had little that was new to tell us, and what he
had was of a kind&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She broke off, choked by
tears.&nbsp; What she had heard of the girl&rsquo;s self-devotion
touched her trebly at the sight of one so small, young, and
soft-looking.&nbsp; And if she had ever been dubious of
&lsquo;Peter&rsquo;s pet,&rsquo; she was completely
fascinated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not be taken on his word,&rsquo; said Cilla,
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that would not be right by any of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then pray be very hard with me&mdash;as a thorough
stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am so inexperienced, I have only had one
interview with a governess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did she do?&rsquo; asked Lucilla, as both
recovered from a laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She gave so voluble an account of her
<i>ac</i>quirements and <i>re</i>quirements, that I was quite
alarmed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t do that.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what I can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A pause, broken by Lucy, who began to feel that she had more
of the cool readiness of the great world.&nbsp; &lsquo;How old is
your daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nearly fifteen.&nbsp; While we had our small parish in
Sussex we taught her ourselves, and her father brought her on in
Latin and Euclid.&nbsp; Do you know anything of those, Miss
Sandbrook? not that it signifies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote used to teach me with my brother.&nbsp;
I have forgotten, but I could soon get them up again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They will hardly be wanted, but Sarah will respect you
for them.&nbsp; Now, at Southminster, our time is so taken up
that poor Sarah gets neglected, and it is very trying to an
eager, diligent girl to prepare lessons, and have them
continually put off, so we thought of indulging her with a
governess, to bring her on in some of the modern languages and
accomplishments that have grown rusty with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I could do that,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I believe I know what other people do, and my languages
are fresh from the Continent.&nbsp; Ought I to give you a
specimen of my pronunciation?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; laughed Mrs.
Prendergast.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know better than I what is right,
and must prepare to be horrified by the sounds you will
hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought to have brought my sketches.&nbsp; I had two
years of lessons from S---.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sarah is burning for teaching in that line.&nbsp;
Music?&nbsp; Dr. Prendergast likes the grand old pieces, and
hardly cares for modern ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly played anything newer than Mozart at
Hiltonbury.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote taught me very well, I believe,
and I had lessons from the organist from Elverslope, besides a
good deal in the fashionable line since.&nbsp; I have kept that
up.&nbsp; One wants it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was another shy pause, and Lucilla growing more
scrupulous and more confidential, volunteered,&mdash;&lsquo;Mine
has been an idle life since I came out.&nbsp; I am
three-and-twenty now, and have been diligently forgetting for the
last six years.&nbsp; Did you know that I had been a fast young
lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But things had come to such a pass, that say what she would,
all passed for ingenuous candour and humility, and the answer
was,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that you have led a very trying life, but to
have passed through such unscathed is no disadvantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I have,&rsquo; said Lucy, sadly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prendergast, who had learned all the facts of
Lucilla&rsquo;s history through the Wrapworth medium, knew only
the heroic side of her character, and admired her the more for
her diffidence.&nbsp; So when terms were spoken of, the only fear
on the one side was, that such a treasure must be beyond her
means; on the other, lest what she needed for her nephew&rsquo;s
sake might deprive her of such a home.&nbsp; However, seventy
pounds a year proved to be in the thoughts of both, and the
preliminaries ended with, &lsquo;I hope you will find my little
Sarah a pleasant companion.&nbsp; She is a good girl, and
intelligent, but you must be prepared for a few
angles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like angles.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care for commonplace
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid that you will find many such at
Southminster.&nbsp; We cannot promise you the society you have
been used to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am tired of society.&nbsp; I have had six years of
it!&rsquo; and she sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must fix your own time,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Prendergast; &lsquo;and indeed we will try to make you at
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother will be gone in a fortnight,&rsquo; said
Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;After that I should like to come straight
to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her tone and look made those two last words not merely <i>chez
vous</i>, but to <i>you</i>, individually&mdash;to you, kind one,
who will comfort me after the cruel parting.&nbsp; Mrs.
Prendergast put her arm round her and kissed her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Lucilla, with the sweetest
April face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear being made
foolish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Mrs. Prendergast showed such warm interest in
<!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>all her concerns, that she felt only that she had
acquired a dear friend by the time the others came in, father and
daughter complaining, the one gaily, the other dolefully, that
Cousin Peter had so hunted them that they could look at nothing
in peace.&nbsp; Indeed he was in such a state of restless misery,
that Mrs. Prendergast, in compassion to him, sent her daughter to
dress, called her husband away, and left the place clear for him
to say, in a tone of the deepest commiseration, &lsquo;Well, my
poor child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Mr. Pendy, you have found me a true home.&nbsp; Be
the others what they may, there must be rest in hearing
<i>her</i> voice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is settled, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I only hope you have not taken them
in.&nbsp; I did my best to let her know the worst of me, but it
would make no impression.&nbsp; Seventy pounds a year.&nbsp; I
hope that is not wicked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Cilla, what would your father feel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, we won&rsquo;t fight that over again.&nbsp; I
thought I had convinced you of the dignity of labour, and I do
feel as if at last I had lit on some one whom I could allow to do
me good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not console him; he grieved over her changed
circumstances with far more regret than she felt, and though glad
for her sake that she should be with those whom he could trust,
yet his connection with her employers seemed to him undutiful
towards his late rector.&nbsp; All that she saw of them reassured
her.&nbsp; The family manners were full of well-bred good-humour,
full of fun, with high intelligence, much real refinement, and no
pretension.&nbsp; The father was the most polished, with the
scholarly courtesy of the dignified clergyman; the mother was the
most simple and caressing; the daughter somewhat uncouth, readily
betraying both her feelings and her cleverness and drollery in
the style of the old friend whom Lucilla was amused to see
treated as a youth and almost a contemporary of her pupil.&nbsp;
What chiefly diverted her was the grotesque aspect of Dr.
Prendergast and his daughter.&nbsp; Both were on a large scale,
with immense mouths, noses turned up to display wide nostrils,
great gray eyes, angularly set, yellow hair and eyebrows, red
complexions, and big bones.&nbsp; The Doctor had the advantage of
having outgrown the bloom of his ugliness; his forehead was bald
and dignified, his locks softened by grizzling, and his fine
expression and clerical figure would have carried off all the
quaintness of his features if they had not been so comically
caricatured in his daughter; yet she looked so full of life and
character that Lucilla was attracted, and sure of getting on well
with her.&nbsp; Moreover, the little elf felt the impression she
was creating in this land of Brobdignag.&nbsp; Sarah was looking
at her as a terra-cotta pitcher might regard a cup of egg-shell
china, and Lucy had never been lovelier.&nbsp; Her mourning
enhanced the purity of her white skin, and marked her slender
faultless shape; her flaxen hair hung in careless wreaths of
ringlet and braid; her countenance, if pale, had greater
sweetness <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>in its dejection, now and then
brightened by gleams of her courageous spirit.&nbsp; Sarah gazed
with untiring wonder, pardoning Cousin Peter for disturbing the
contemplation of Domenichino&rsquo;s art, since here was a
witness that heroines of romance were no mere myths, but that
beings of ivory and rose, sapphire eyes and golden hair, might
actually walk the earth.</p>
<p>The Doctor was pleasant and friendly, and after luncheon the
whole party started together to &lsquo;do&rsquo; St.
Paul&rsquo;s, whence Mr. Prendergast undertook to take Cilla
home, but in no haste to return to the lonely house.&nbsp; She
joined in the lionizing, and made a great impression by her
familiarity with London, old and new.&nbsp; Little store as she
had set by Honor&rsquo;s ecclesiology and antiquarianism, she had
not failed to imbibe a tincture sufficient to go a long way by
the help of ready wit, and she enchanted the Doctor by her odd
bits of information on the localities, and by guiding him to
out-of-the-way curiosities.&nbsp; She even carried the party to
Woolstone-lane, displayed the Queen of Sheba, the cedar carving,
the merchant&rsquo;s mark, and had lifted out Stow&rsquo;s
<i>Survey</i>, where Sarah was delighted with Ranelagh, when the
door opened, and Owen stood, surprised and blank.&nbsp; Poor
fellow, the voices had filled him with hope that he should find
Honor there.&nbsp; The visitors, startled at thus intruding on
his trouble, and knowing him to be in profound disgrace, would
have gone, but he, understanding them to be Mr.
Prendergast&rsquo;s friends, and glad of variety, was eagerly
courteous and hospitable, detaining them by displaying fresh
curiosities, and talking with so much knowledge and brilliance,
that they were too well entertained to be in haste.&nbsp;
Lucilla, accepting Mrs. Prendergast as a friend, was rejoiced
that she should have such demonstration that her brother was a
thorough gentleman; and in truth Owen did and said everything so
well that no one could fail to be pleased, and only as an
after-thought could come the perception that his ease hardly
befitted the circumstances, and that he comported himself more
like the master of the house than as a
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> under a cloud.</p>
<p>No sooner had he handed them into their vehicle than he sank
into a chair, and burst into one of the prolonged, vehement fits
of laughter that are the reaction of early youth unwontedly
depressed.&nbsp; Never had he seen such visages!&nbsp; They ought
at once to be sketched&mdash;would be worth any money to Currie
the architect, for gurgoyles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame,&rsquo; said Lucilla, glad, however, once
more to hear the merry peal; &lsquo;for shame, to laugh at my
master!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing at old Pendy, his orifice is a
mere crevice comparatively.&nbsp; The charm is in seeing it
classified&mdash;the recent sloth accounted for by the ancient
megatherium.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The megatherium is my master.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;m
governess to Glumdalclitch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve done it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have.&nbsp; Seventy pounds a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>He made a gesture of angry despair, crying,
&lsquo;Worse luck than I thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better luck than I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Pendy thrusting in his oar!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have
put a stop to your absurdity at once, if I had not been sure no
one would be deluded enough to engage you, and that you would be
tired of looking out, and glad to go back to your proper place at
the Holt before I sailed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My proper place is where I can be
independent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faugh!&nbsp; If I had known it, they should never have
seen the Roman coins!&nbsp; There! it is a lesson that nothing is
too chimerical to be worth opposing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your opposition would have made no
difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her silently, but with a half smile in lip and
eye that showed her that the moment was coming when the
man&rsquo;s will might be stronger than the woman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Indeed, he was so thoroughly displeased and annoyed that she
durst not discuss the subject with him, lest she should rouse him
to take some strong authoritative measures against it.&nbsp; He
had always trusted to the improbability of her meeting with a
situation before his departure, when, between entreaty and
command, he had reckoned on inducing her to go home; and this
engagement came as a fresh blow, making him realize what he had
brought on those nearest and dearest to him.&nbsp; Even praise of
Mrs. Prendergast provoked him, as if implying Lucilla&rsquo;s
preference for her above the tried friend of their childhood; he
was in his lowest spirits, hardly speaking to his sister all
dinner-time, and hurried off afterwards to pour out his vexation
to Robert Fulmort.&nbsp; Poor Robert! what an infliction!&nbsp;
To hear of such a step, and be unable to interfere; to admire,
yet not approve; to dread the consequences, and perceive so much
alloy as to dull the glitter of the gold, as well as to believe
his own stern precipitation as much the cause as Owen&rsquo;s
errors; yet all the time to be the friend and comforter to the
wounded spirit of the brother!&nbsp; It was a severe task; and
when Owen left him, he felt spent and wearied as by bodily
exertion, as he hid his face in prayer for one for whom he could
do no more than pray.</p>
<p>Feelings softened during the fortnight that the brother and
sister spent together.&nbsp; Childishly as Owen had undergone the
relations and troubles of more advanced life, pettishly as he had
striven against feeling and responsibility, the storm had taken
effect.&nbsp; Hard as he had struggled to remain a boy, manhood
had suddenly grown on him; and probably his exclusion from
Hiltonbury did more to stamp the impression of his guilt than did
its actual effects.&nbsp; He was eager for his new life, and
pleased with his employer, promising himself all success, and
full of enterprise.&nbsp; But his banishment from home and from
Honor clouded everything; and, as the time drew nearer, his
efforts to forget and be reckless gradually ceased.&nbsp; Far
from <!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>shunning Lucilla, as at first, he
was unwilling to lose sight of her, and they went about together
wherever his preparations called him, so that she could hardly
make time for stitching, marking, and arranging his
purchases.</p>
<p>One good sign was, that, though hitherto fastidiously
expensive in dress and appointments, he now grudged himself all
that was not absolutely necessary, in the endeavour to leave as
large a sum as possible with Mrs. Murrell.&nbsp; Even in the
tempting article of mathematical instruments he was provident,
though the polished brass, shining steel, and pure ivory, in
their perfection of exactitude, were as alluring to him as ever
gem or plume had been to his sister.&nbsp; That busy fortnight of
chasing after the &lsquo;reasonable and good,&rsquo; speeding
about till they were foot-sore, discussing, purchasing, packing,
and contriving, united the brother and sister more than all their
previous lives.</p>
<p>It was over but too soon.&nbsp; The last evening was come; the
hall was full of tin cases and leathern portmanteaus, marked O.
C. S., and of piles of black boxes large enough to contain the
little lady whose name they bore.&nbsp; Southminster lay in the
Trent Valley, so the travellers would start together, and Lucilla
would be dropped on the way.&nbsp; In the cedar parlour,
Owen&rsquo;s black knapsack lay open on the floor, and Lucilla
was doing the last office in her power for him, and that a sad
one, furnishing the Russia-leather housewife with the needles,
silk, thread, and worsted for his own mendings when he should be
beyond the reach of the womankind who cared for him.</p>
<p>He sat resting his head on his hand, watching her in silence,
till she was concluding her work.&nbsp; Then he said, &lsquo;Give
me a bit of silk,&rsquo; turned his back on her, and stood up,
doing something by the light of the lamp.&nbsp; She was kneeling
over the knapsack, and did not see what he was about, till she
found his hand on her head, and heard the scissors close, when
she perceived that he had cut off one of her pale, bright
ringlets, and saw his pocket-book open, and within it a thick,
jet-black tress, and one scanty, downy tuft of baby hair.&nbsp;
She made no remark; but the tears came dropping, as she packed;
and, with a sudden impulse to give him the thing above all others
precious to her, she pulled from her bosom a locket, hung from a
slender gold chain, and held it to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, will you have this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose?&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And my mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He gave it to me when he
went to Nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen took it and looked at it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Lucy,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I would not take it
from you on any account.&nbsp; You have always been his faithful
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind you tell me if any one remembers him in
Canada,&rsquo; said Lucilla, between relief and disappointment,
restoring her treasure to the place it had never left
before.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will find out whether he is recollected
at his mission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; But I do not expect it.&nbsp; The
place is a great <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>town now.&nbsp; I say, Lucy, if you
had one bit of poor Honor&rsquo;s hair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No: you will never forgive me.&nbsp; I had some once,
made up in a little cross, with gold ends; but one day, when she
would not let me go to Castle Blanch, I shied it into the river,
in a rage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was touched at his being so spiritless as not even to say
that she ought to have been thrown in after it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; she said, by way of enlivening him,
&lsquo;whether you will fall in with the auburn-haired
Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whereas Canada is a bigger place than England, the
disaster may be averted, I hope.&nbsp; A colonial heir-at-law
might be a monstrous bore.&nbsp; Moreover, it would cancel all
that I can&rsquo;t but hope for that child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might hope better things for him than
expectations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall never have any!&nbsp; But it might come
without.&nbsp; Why, Lucy, a few years in that country, and I
shall be able to give him the best of educations and release you
from drudgery; and when independent, we could go back to the Holt
on terms to suit even your proud stomach, and might make the dear
old thing happy in her old age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that Holt were but out of your head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I knew it willed to the County Hospital,
shouldn&rsquo;t I wish as much to be with her as before?&nbsp; I
mean to bring up my son as a gentleman, with no one&rsquo;s
help!&nbsp; But you see, Lucy, it is impossible not to wish for
one&rsquo;s child what one has failed in oneself&mdash;to wish
him to be a better edition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For these first few years the old woman will do well
enough for him, poor child.&nbsp; Robert has promised to look in
on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Mrs. Murrell is to write to me once a month.&nbsp;
I shall make a point of seeing him at least twice a
year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you; and by the time he is of any size I shall
have a salary.&nbsp; I may come back, and we would keep house
together, or you might bring him out to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will be the hope of my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not be deluded into reckoning on young
ladies.&nbsp; You will be disposed of long before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Owen!&nbsp; No, never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always wanted to know,&rsquo; continued Owen,
&lsquo;what became of Calthorp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I left him behind at Spitzwasserfitzung, with a message
that ends it for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid that defection is to be laid to my door,
like all the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If so, I am heartily obliged to you for it!&nbsp; The
shock was welcome that brought me home.&nbsp; A governess?&nbsp;
Oh! I had rather be a scullery-maid, than go on as I was doing
there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you did not care for him?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>&lsquo;Never!&nbsp; But he pestered me, Rashe pestered
me; nobody cared for me&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo; and she
sobbed a long, tearless sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Owen, gravely and kindly, &lsquo;then
there was something in the Fulmort affair after all.&nbsp; Lucy,
I am going away; let me hear it for once.&nbsp; If I ever come
back, I will not be so heedless of you as I have been.&nbsp; If
he have been using you ill!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I used him ill,&rsquo; said Lucy, in an inward
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing more likely!&rsquo; muttered Owen, in
soliloquy.&nbsp; &lsquo;But how is it, Cilla: can&rsquo;t you
make him forgive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does, but as Honor forgives you.&nbsp; You know it
was no engagement.&nbsp; I worked him up to desperation last
year.&nbsp; Through Ph&oelig;be, I was warned that he would not
stand my going to Ireland.&nbsp; I answered that it was no
concern of his; I defied him to be able to break with me.&nbsp;
They bothered me so that I was forced to go to spite them.&nbsp;
He thought&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wonder at it&mdash;that I was
irreclaimable; he was staying here, was worked on by the sight of
this horrible district, and, between pique and goodness run mad,
has devoted self and fortune.&nbsp; He gave me to understand that
he has made away with every farthing.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if
he would wish it undone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke into the knapsack, jerking out brief sentences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you he had taken a vow of
celibacy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not think it worth while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is all right!&rsquo; exclaimed Owen,
joyously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think old Fulmort, wallowing in
gold, could see a son of his living with his curates, as in the
old Sussex rhyme?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There were three ghostisses<br />
Sitting on three postisses,<br />
Eating of three crustisses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, depend on it, the first alarm of Robert becoming a ghost,
there will be a famous good fat living bought for him; and
then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I shall have been a governess.&nbsp; They
won&rsquo;t consent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw!&nbsp; What are the Fulmorts?&nbsp; He would
honour you the more!&nbsp; No, Lucy,&rsquo; and he drew her up
from the floor, and put his arm round her, &lsquo;girls who stick
to one as you have done to me are worth something, and so is
Robert Fulmort.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what he has been to me
ever since he came to fetch me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t believe it
was in his cloth or his nature to be so forbearing.&nbsp; No
worrying with preachments; not a bit of &ldquo;What a good boy am
I;&rdquo; always doing the very thing that was comfortable and
considerate, and making the best of it at Hiltonbury.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t know how he could be capable of it, but now I see,
it was for your sake.&nbsp; Cheer up, Lucy, you will find it
right yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla had no conviction that he was right; but she was
willing to believe for the time, and was glad to lay her head on
his shoulder and feel, while she could, that she had something
entirely her own.&nbsp; Too soon it would be over.&nbsp; Lengthen
the evening as they would, morning must come at last.</p>
<p><!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>It came; the hurried breakfast, pale looks, and trivial
words.&nbsp; Robert arrived to watch them off; Mrs. Murrell
brought the child.&nbsp; Owen took him in his arms, and called
her to the study.&nbsp; Robert sat still, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will do what I can.&nbsp; I think, in case I had to
write about the child, you had better leave me your
address.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla wrote it on a card.&nbsp; The tone quashed all
hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We trust to you,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Currie has promised to let me hear of Owen,&rsquo;
said Robert; but no more passed.&nbsp; Owen came back hasty and
flushed, wanting to be gone and have it over.&nbsp; The cabs were
called, and he was piling them with luggage; Robert was glad to
be actively helpful.&nbsp; All were in the hall; Owen turned back
for one more solitary gaze round the familiar room; Robert shook
Lucilla&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O bid me good speed,&rsquo; broke from her; &lsquo;or I
cannot bear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God be with you.&nbsp; God bless you!&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>No more!&nbsp; He had not approved, he had not blamed.&nbsp;
He would interfere no more in her fate.&nbsp; She seated herself,
and drew down her black veil, a chill creeping over her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Robert, for all,&rsquo; was Owen&rsquo;s
farewell.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you will say anything to Ph&oelig;be
from me, tell her she is all that is left to comfort poor
Honor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; was the only answer.</p>
<p>Owen lingered still.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll write?&nbsp;
Tell me of her; Honor, I mean, and the child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unable to find another pretext for delay, Owen again wrung
Robert&rsquo;s hand, and placed himself by his sister, keeping
his head out as long as he could see Robert standing with crossed
arms on the doorstep.</p>
<p>When, the same afternoon, Mr. Parsons came home, he blamed
himself for having yielded to his youngest curate the brunt of
the summer work.&nbsp; Never had he seen a man not unwell look so
much jaded and depressed.</p>
<p>Nearly at the same time, Lucilla and her boxes were on the
platform of the Southminster station, Owen&rsquo;s eyes straining
after her as the train rushed on, and she feeling positive pain
and anger at the sympathy of Dr. Prendergast&rsquo;s kind voice,
as though it would have been a relief to her tumultuous misery to
have bitten him, like Uncle Kit long ago.&nbsp; She clenched her
hand tight, when with old-world courtesy he made her take his
arm, and with true consideration, conducted her down the hill,
through the quieter streets, to the calm, shady precincts of the
old cathedral.&nbsp; He had both a stall and a large town living;
and his abode was the gray freestone prebendal house, whose two
deep windows under their peaked gables gave it rather a cat-like
physiognomy.&nbsp; Mrs. Prendergast and Sarah were waiting in the
hall, each with a kiss of welcome, and the former took the pale
girl at once up-stairs, to a room full of subdued <!-- page
316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>sunshine, looking out on a green lawn sloping down to
the river.&nbsp; At that sight and sound, Lucy&rsquo;s face
lightened.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! I know I shall feel at home
here.&nbsp; I hear the water&rsquo;s voice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she had brought with her a heavy cold, kept in abeyance by
a strong will during the days of activity, and ready to have its
way at once, when she was beaten down by fatigue, fasting, and
disappointment.&nbsp; She dressed and came down, but could
neither eat nor talk, and in her pride was glad to attribute all
to the cold, though protesting with over-eagerness that such
indisposition was rare with her.</p>
<p>She would not have suffered such nursing from Honor Charlecote
as was bestowed upon her.&nbsp; The last month had made
tenderness valuable, and without knowing all, kind Mrs.
Prendergast could well believe that there might be more than even
was avowed to weigh down the young head, and cause the fingers,
when unobserved, to lock together in suppressed agony.</p>
<p>While Sarah only knew that her heroine-looking governess was
laid up with severe influenza, her mother more than guessed at
the kind of battle wrestled out in solitude, and was sure that
more than brother, more than friend, had left her to that lonely
suffering, which was being for the first time realized.&nbsp; But
no confidence was given; when Lucilla spoke, it was only of Owen,
and Mrs. Prendergast returned kindness and forbearance.</p>
<p>It was soothing to be dreamily in that summer room, the
friendly river murmuring, the shadows of the trees lazily dancing
on the wall, the cathedral bells chiming, or an occasional deep
note of the organ stealing in through the open window.&nbsp; It
suited well with the languor of sensation that succeeded to so
much vehemence and excitement.&nbsp; It was not thought, it was
not resignation, but a species of repose and calm, as if all
interest, all feeling, were over for her, and as if it mattered
little what might further befall her, as long as she could be
quiet, and get along from one day to another.&nbsp; If it had
been repentance, a letter would have been written very unlike the
cold announcement of her situation, the scanty notices of her
brother, with which she wrung the heart that yearned after her at
Hiltonbury.&nbsp; But sorry she was, for one part at least, of
her conduct, and she believed herself reduced to that meek and
correct state that she had always declared should succeed her
days of gaiety, when, recovering from her indisposition, she came
down subdued in tone, and anxious to fulfil what she had
undertaken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! if Robert could see me now, he would believe in
me,&rsquo; thought she to herself, as she daily went to the
cathedral.&nbsp; She took classes at school, helped to train the
St. Jude&rsquo;s choir, played Handel for Dr. Prendergast, and
felt absolutely without heart or inclination to show that
self-satisfied young curate that a governess was not a subject
for such distant perplexed courtesy.&nbsp; Sad at heart, and glad
to distract her mind by what was new yet innocent, she took up
the duties of her vocation zealously; and quickly found that all
her zeal was needed.&nbsp; Her <!-- page 317--><a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>pupil was a
girl of considerable abilities&mdash;intellectual, thoughtful,
and well taught; and she herself had been always so unwilling a
learner, so willing a forgetter, that she needed all the
advantages of her grown-up mind and rapidity of perception to
keep her sufficiently beforehand with Sarah, whenever subjects
went deep or far.&nbsp; If she pronounced like a native, and knew
what was idiomatic, Sarah, with her clumsy pronunciation, had
further insight into grammar, and asked perplexing questions; if
she played admirably and with facility, Sarah could puzzle her
with the science of music; if her drawing were ever so effective
and graceful, Sarah&rsquo;s less sightly productions had correct
details that put hers to shame, and, for mere honesty&rsquo;s
sake, and to keep up her dignity, she was obliged to work hard,
and recur to the good grounding that against her will she had
received at Hiltonbury.&nbsp; &lsquo;Had her education been as
superficial as that of her cousins,&rsquo; she wrote to her
brother, &lsquo;Sarah would have put her to shame long ago;
indeed, nobody but the Fennimore could be thoroughly up to that
girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps all her endeavours would not have impressed Sarah, had
not the damsel been thoroughly imposed on by her own enthusiasm
for Miss Sandbrook&rsquo;s grace, facility, alertness, and
beauty.&nbsp; The power of doing prettily and rapidly whatever
she took up dazzled the large and deliberate young person, to
whom the right beginning and steady thoroughness were essential,
and she regarded her governess as a sort of fairy&mdash;toiling
after her in admiring hopelessness, and delighted at any small
success.</p>
<p>Fully aware of her own plainness, Sarah adored Miss
Sandbrook&rsquo;s beauty, took all admiration of it as personally
as if it been paid to her bullfinch, and was never so charmed as
when people addressed themselves to the governess as the daughter
of the house.&nbsp; Lucilla, however, shrank into the
background.&nbsp; She was really treated thoroughly as a
relation, but she dreaded the remarks and inquiries of strangers,
and wished to avoid them.&nbsp; The society of the cathedral town
was not exciting nor tempting, and she made no great sacrifice in
preferring her pretty schoolroom to the dinners and evening
parties of the Close; but she did so in a very becoming manner,
and delighted Sarah with stories of the great world, and of her
travels.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that father, mother, and daughter all
liked and valued her extremely, and she loved Mrs. Prendergast as
she had never loved woman before, with warm, filial, confiding
love.&nbsp; She was falling into the interests of the cathedral
and the parish, and felt them, and her occupations in the
morning, satisfying and full of rest after the unsatisfactory
whirl of her late life.&nbsp; She was becoming happier than she
knew, and at any rate felt it a delusion to imagine the post of
governess an unhappy one.&nbsp; Three years at Southminster (for
Sarah strenuously insisted that she would come out as late as
possible) would be all peace, rest, and improvement; and by that
time Owen would be ready for her to bring his child out to him,
or else&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>Little did she reck of the grave, displeased, yet far
more sorrowful letter in which Honor wrote, &lsquo;You have
chosen your own path in life, may you find it one of improvement
and blessing!&nbsp; But I think it right to say, that though real
distress shall of course always make what is past forgotten, yet
you must not consider Hiltonbury a refuge if you grow hastily
weary of your exertions.&nbsp; Since you refuse to find a mother
in me, and choose to depend on yourself alone, it must be in
earnest, not caprice.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are of beauty rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In holy calmness growing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of minds whose richness might compare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en with thy deep tints

Yet all unconscious of the grace they wear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flowers upon the spray,<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Ph&oelig;be Fulmort sat in her own room.&nbsp; The little
round clock on the mantelpiece pointed to eleven.&nbsp; The fire
was low but glowing.&nbsp; The clear gas shone brightly on the
toilette apparatus, and on the central table, loaded with tokens
of occupation, but neat and orderly as the lines in the clasped
volume where Ph&oelig;be was dutifully writing her abstract of
the day&rsquo;s reading and observation, in childishly correct
miniature round-hand.</p>
<p>The curtain was looped up, and the moon of a frosty night
blanched a square on the carpet beneath the window, at which she
often looked with a glistening gaze.&nbsp; Her father and brother
had been expected at dinner-time; and though their detention was
of frequent occurrence, Ph&oelig;be had deferred undressing till
it should be too late for their arrival by the last train, since
they would like her to preside over their supper, and she might
possibly hear of Robert, whose doings her father had of late
seemed to regard with less displeasure, though she had not been
allowed to go with Miss Charlecote to the consecration of his
church, and had not seen him since the Horticultural Show.</p>
<p>She went to the window for a final look.&nbsp; White and crisp
lay the path, chequered by the dark defined shadows of the trees;
above was the sky, pearly with moonlight, allowing only a few
larger stars to appear, and one glorious planet.&nbsp; Fascinated
by the silent beauty, she stood gazing, wishing she could
distinguish Jupiter&rsquo;s moons, observing on the difference
between his steady reflected brilliance and the sun-like glories
of Arcturus and Aldebaran, and passing on to the moral Miss
Charlecote loved, of the stars being with us all day unseen, like
the great cloud of witnesses.&nbsp; She hoped Miss Charlecote saw
<!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>that moon; for sunrise or set, rainbow, evening gleam,
new moon, or shooting star, gave Ph&oelig;be double pleasure by
comparing notes with Miss Charlecote, and though that lady was
absent, helping Mrs. Saville to tend her husband&rsquo;s mortal
sickness, it was likely that she might be watching and admiring
this same fair moon.&nbsp; Well that there are many girls who,
like Ph&oelig;be, can look forth on the Creator&rsquo;s glorious
handiwork as such, in peace and soothing, &lsquo;in maiden
meditation fancy free,&rsquo; instead of linking these heavenly
objects to the feverish fancies of troubled hearts!</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was just turning from the window, when she heard
wheels sounding on the frosty drive, and presently a carriage
appeared, the shadow spectrally lengthened on the slope of the
whitened bank.&nbsp; All at once it stopped where the roads
diverged to the front and back entrances, a black figure
alighted, took out a bag, dismissed the vehicle, and took the
path to the offices.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart
throbbed.&nbsp; It was Robert!</p>
<p>As he disappeared, she noiselessly opened her door, guardedly
passed the baize door of the west wing, descended the stairs, and
met him in the hall.&nbsp; Neither spoke till they were in the
library, which had been kept prepared for the travellers.&nbsp;
Robert pressed her to him and kissed her fervently, and she found
voice to say, &lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; Papa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>She needed not to ask the extent of the calamity.&nbsp; She
stood looking in his face, while, the beginning once made, he
spoke in low, quick accents.&nbsp; &lsquo;Paralysis.&nbsp; Last
night.&nbsp; He was insensible when Edwards called him this
morning.&nbsp; Nothing could be done.&nbsp; It was over by three
this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be, understanding, but not
yet feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At his rooms at the office.&nbsp; He had spent the
evening there alone.&nbsp; It was not known till eight this
morning.&nbsp; I was there instantly, Mervyn and Bevil soon
after, but he knew none of us.&nbsp; Mervyn thought I had better
come here.&nbsp; Oh, Ph&oelig;be, my mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will see if she have heard anything,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, moving quietly off, as though one in a dream, able
to act, move, and decide, though not to think.</p>
<p>She found the household in commotion.&nbsp; Robert had spoken
to the butler, and everywhere were knots of whisperers.&nbsp;
Miss Fennimore met Ph&oelig;be with her eyes full of tears, tears
as yet far from those of Ph&oelig;be herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
mother has heard nothing,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I ascertained
that from Boodle, who only left her dressing-room since your
brother&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; You had better let her have her
night&rsquo;s rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert, who had followed Ph&oelig;be, hailed this as a
reprieve, and thanked Miss Fennimore, adding the few particulars
he had told his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope the girls are
asleep,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sound asleep, I trust,&rsquo; said Miss
Fennimore.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will take care of them,&rsquo; and
laying her hand on Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s shoulder, she suggested to
her that her brother had probably not eaten all <!-- page
320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>day, then left them to return to the library
together.&nbsp; There had been more time for Robert to look the
thought in the face than his sister.&nbsp; He was no longer
freshly stunned.&nbsp; He really needed food, and ate in silence,
while she mechanically waited on him.&nbsp; At last he looked up,
saying, &lsquo;I am thankful.&nbsp; A few months ago, how could I
have borne it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been sure he understood you better of
late,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sunday week was one of the happiest days I have spent
for years.&nbsp; Imagine my surprise at seeing him and Acton in
the church.&nbsp; They took luncheon with us, looked into the
schools, went to evening service, and saw the whole
concern.&nbsp; He was kinder than ever I knew him, and Acton says
he expressed himself as much pleased.&nbsp; I owe a great deal to
Bevil Acton, and, I know, to you.&nbsp; Now I know that he had
forgiven me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, Robin!&nbsp; There was nothing to forgive.&nbsp; I
can fancy poor Mervyn feeling dreadfully, but you, always dutiful
except for the higher duty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; Mine was grudging
service.&nbsp; I loved opposition, and there was an evil triumph
in the annoyance I gave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not regretting your work.&nbsp; O
no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the work, but the manner!&nbsp; Oh! that the gift
of the self-willed son be not Corban.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert! indeed you had his approval.&nbsp; You told me
so.&nbsp; He was seeing things differently.&nbsp; It was so new
to him that his business could be thought hurtful, that he was
displeased at first, or, rather, Mervyn made him seem more
displeased than he was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You only make me the more repent!&nbsp; Had I been what
I ought at home, my principles would have been very differently
received!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;there was little opportunity.&nbsp; We have been so little
with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Ph&oelig;be, it is a miserable thing to have always
lived at such a distance from them, that I should better know how
to tell such tidings to any old woman in my district than to my
mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their consultations were broken by Miss Fennimore coming to
insist on Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s sleeping, in preparation for the
trying morrow.&nbsp; Robert was thankful for her heedfulness, and
owned himself tired, dismissing his sister with a blessing that
had in it a tone of protection.</p>
<p>How changed was Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s peaceful chamber in her
eyes!&nbsp; Nothing had altered, but a fresh act in her life had
begun&mdash;the first sorrow had fallen on her.</p>
<p>She would have knelt on for hours, leaning dreamily on the new
sense of the habitual words, &lsquo;Our Father,&rsquo; had not
Miss Fennimore come kindly and tenderly to undress her, insisting
on her saving herself, and promising not to let her oversleep
herself, treating her with wise and soothing affection, and
authority that was most comfortable.</p>
<p>Little danger was there of her sleeping too late.&nbsp; All
night <!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>long she lay, with dry and open
eyes, while the fire, groaning, sank together, and faded into
darkness, and the moonbeams retreated slowly from floor to wall,
and were lost as gray cold dawn began to light the window.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be had less to reproach herself with than any one of Mr.
Fulmort&rsquo;s children, save the poor innocent, Maria; but many
a shortcoming, many a moment of impatience or discontent, many a
silent impulse of blame, were grieved over, and every kindness
she had received shot through her heart with mournful gladness
and warmth, filling her with yearning for another embrace,
another word, or even that she had known that the last good-bye
had been the last, that she might have prized it&mdash;oh, how
intensely!</p>
<p>Then came anxious imaginings for the future, such as would not
be stilled by the knowledge that all would settle itself over her
head.&nbsp; There were misgivings whether her mother would be
properly considered, fears of the mutual relations between her
brothers, a sense that the family bond was loosed, and confusion
and jarring might ensue; but, as her mind recoiled from the
shoals and the gloom, the thought revived of the Pilot amid the
waves of this troublesome world.&nbsp; She closed her eyes for
prayer, but not for sleep.&nbsp; Repose even more precious and
soothing than slumber was granted&mdash;the repose of confidence
in the Everlasting Arms, and of confiding to them all the feeble
and sorrowful with whom she was linked.&nbsp; It was as though
(in the words of her own clasped book) her God were <i>more</i>
to her than ever, truly a very <i>present</i> Help in trouble;
and, as the dawn brightened for a day so unlike all others, her
heart trembled less, and she rose up with eyes heavy and limbs
weary, but better prepared for the morning&rsquo;s ordeal than
even by sleep ending in a wakening to the sudden shock.</p>
<p>When Miss Fennimore vigilantly met her on leaving her room,
and surveyed her anxiously, to judge of her health and powers,
there was a serious, sweet collectedness in air and face that
struck the governess with loving awe and surprise.</p>
<p>The younger girls had known their father too little to be much
affected by the loss.&nbsp; Maria stared in round-eyed amaze, and
Bertha, though subdued and shocked for a short space, revived
into asking a torrent of questions, culminating in &lsquo;Should
they do any lessons?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereto Miss Fennimore replied
with a decided affirmative, and, though Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s taste
disapproved, she saw that it was wiser not to interfere.</p>
<p>Much fatigued, Robert slept late, but joined his sister long
before the dreaded moment of hearing their mother&rsquo;s
bell.&nbsp; They need not have been fearful of the immediate
effect; Mrs. Fulmort&rsquo;s perceptions were tardy, and the
endeavours at preparation were misunderstood, till it was needful
to be explicit.&nbsp; A long stillness followed, broken at last
by Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s question, whether she would not see
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not till I am up, my dear,&rsquo; she
answered, in an injured voice; &lsquo;do, pray, see whether
Boodle is coming with my warm water.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>Her mind was not yet awake to the stroke, and was
lapsing into its ordinary mechanical routine; her two breakfasts,
and protracted dressing, occupied her for nearly two hours, after
which she did not refuse to see her son, but showed far less
emotion than he did, while he gave the details of the past
day.&nbsp; Her dull, apathetic gaze was a contrast with the young
man&rsquo;s gush of tears, and the caresses that Ph&oelig;be
lavished on her listless hand.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be proposed that
Robert should read to her&mdash;she assented, and soon dozed,
awaking to ask plaintively for Boodle and her afternoon cup of
tea.</p>
<p>So passed the following days, her state nearly the same, and
her interest apparently feebly roused by the mourning, but by
nothing else.&nbsp; She did not like that Ph&oelig;be should
leave her, but was more at ease with her maid than her son, and,
though he daily came to sit with her and read to her, he was
grieved to be unable to be of greater use, while he could seldom
have Ph&oelig;be to himself.&nbsp; Sorely missing Miss
Charlecote, he took his meals in the west wing, where his
presence was highly appreciated, though he was often pained by
Bertha&rsquo;s levity and Maria&rsquo;s imbecility.&nbsp; The
governess treated him with marked esteem and consideration,
strikingly dissimilar to the punctilious, but almost
contemptuous, courtesy of her behaviour to the other gentlemen of
the family, and, after her pupils were gone to bed, would fasten
upon him for a discussion such as her soul delighted in, and his
detested.&nbsp; Secure of his ground, he was not sure of his
powers of reasoning with an able lady of nearly double his years,
and more than double his reading and readiness of speech, yet he
durst not retreat from argument, lest he should seem to yield the
cause that he was sworn to maintain, &lsquo;in season and out of
season.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was hard that his own troubles and other
people&rsquo;s should alike bring him in for controversy on all
the things that end in &lsquo;ism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He learnt by letter from Sir Bevil Acton that his father had
been much struck by what he had seen in Cecily-row, and had
strongly expressed his concern that Robert had been allowed to
strip himself for the sake of a duty, which, if it were such at
all, belonged more to others.&nbsp; There might have been
wrongheaded haste in the action, but if such new-fangled
arrangements had become requisite, it was unfair that one member
of the family alone should bear the whole burthen.&nbsp; Sir
Bevil strongly supported this view, and Mr. Fulmort had declared
himself confirmed in his intention of making provision for his
son in his will, as well as of giving him a fair allowance at
present.&nbsp; There must have been warnings of failing health of
which none had been made aware, for Mr. Fulmort had come to town
partly to arrange for the safe guardianship of poor Maria and her
fortune.&nbsp; An alteration in his will upon the death of one of
the trustees had been too long neglected, and perhaps some
foreboding of the impending malady had urged him at last to
undertake what had been thus deferred.&nbsp; Each of the
daughters was <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>to have &pound;10,000, the overplus
being divided between them and their eldest brother, who would
succeed both to the business, and on his mother&rsquo;s death to
the Beauchamp estate, while the younger had already received an
ample portion as heir to his uncle.&nbsp; Mr. Fulmort, however,
had proposed to place Robert on the same footing with his
sisters, and Sir Bevil had reason to think he had at once acted
on his design.&nbsp; Such thorough forgiveness and approval went
to Robert&rsquo;s heart, and he could scarcely speak as he gave
Ph&oelig;be the letter to read.</p>
<p>When she could discuss it with him after her mother had fallen
asleep for the night, she found that his thoughts had taken a
fresh turn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it should be as Bevil supposes,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;it would make an infinite difference.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
after waiting for an answer only given by inquiring looks, he
continued&mdash;&lsquo;As she is now, it would not be a violent
change; I do not think she would object to my present
situation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Robert, you will not expose yourself to be treated
as before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would not be.&nbsp; There was no want of
attachment; merely over-confidence in her own power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not <i>over</i> confidence, it seems,&rsquo; murmured
Ph&oelig;be, not greatly charmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understood how it had been, when we were thrown
together again,&rsquo; he pursued.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was no
explanation, but it was far worse to bear than if there had
been.&nbsp; I felt myself a perfect brute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon if I can&rsquo;t be pleased just
yet,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know I did not see
her, and I can&rsquo;t think she deserves it after so wantonly
grieving you, and still choosing to forsake Miss
Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For that I feel accountable,&rsquo; said Robert,
sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot forget that her determination
coincided with the evening I made her aware of my position.&nbsp;
I saw that in her face that has haunted me ever since.&nbsp; I
had almost rather it had been resentment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope she will make you happy,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, dolefully, thinking it a pity he should be disturbed
when settled in to his work, and forced by experience to fear
that Lucy would torment him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not do it for the sake of happiness,&rsquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not blind to her faults; but she has
a grand, generous character that deserves patience and
forbearance.&nbsp; Besides, the past can never be cancelled, and
it is due to her to offer her whatever may be mine.&nbsp; There
may be storms, but she has been disciplined, poor dear, and I am
more sure of myself than I was.&nbsp; She <i>should</i> conform,
and my work should not be impeded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grimly he continued to anticipate hurricanes for his wedded
life, and to demonstrate that he was swayed by justice and not by
passion; but it was suspicious that he recurred constantly to the
topic, and seemed able to dwell on no other.&nbsp; If Ph&oelig;be
could have been displeased with him, it would have been for <!--
page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>these reiterations at such a time.&nbsp; Not having
been personally injured, she pardoned less than did either Robert
or Miss Charlecote; she could not foresee peace for her brother;
and though she might pity him for the compulsion of honour and
generosity, she found that his auguries were not intended to
excite compassionate acquiescence, but cheerful contradiction,
such as both her good sense and her oppressed spirits
refused.&nbsp; If he could talk about nothing better than Lucy
when alone with her, she could the less regret the rarity of
these opportunities.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the family alone attended the funeral, the
two elder sisters remaining in town, whither their husbands were
to return at night.&nbsp; Mrs. Fulmort remained in the same
dreary state of heaviness, but with some languid heed to the
details, and interest in hearing from Maria and Bertha, from
behind the blinds, what carriages were at the door, and who got
into them.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, with strong effort, then controlled
her voice to read aloud till her mother dozed as usual, and she
could sit and think until Robert knocked, to summon her to the
reading of the will.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must come,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;I know it jars, but it is Mervyn&rsquo;s wish, and he is
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the stairs Mervyn met her, took her from
Robert, and led her into the drawing-room, where she was kindly
greeted by the brothers-in-law, and seated beside her eldest
brother.&nbsp; As a duty, she gave her attention, and was
rewarded by finding that had he been living, her hero, Mr.
Charlecote, would have been her guardian.&nbsp; The will, dated
fifteen years back, made Humfrey Charlecote, Esquire, trustee and
executor, jointly with James Crabbe, Esquire, the elderly lawyer
at present reading it aloud.&nbsp; The intended codicil had never
been executed.&nbsp; Had any one looked at the downcast face, it
would have been with wonder at the glow of shy pleasure thrilling
over cheeks and brow.</p>
<p>Beauchamp of course remained with the heiress, Mrs. Fulmort,
to whom all thereto appertaining was left; the distillery and all
connected with it descended to the eldest son, John Mervyn
Fulmort; the younger children received &pound;10,000 apiece, and
the residue was to be equally divided among all except the second
son, Robert Mervyn Fulmort, who, having been fully provided for,
was only to receive some pictures and plate that had belonged to
his great uncle.</p>
<p>The lawyer ceased.&nbsp; Sir Bevil leant towards him, and made
an inquiry which was answered by a sign in the negative.&nbsp;
Then taking up some memoranda, Mr. Crabbe announced that as far
as he could yet discover, the brother and five sisters would
divide about &pound;120,000 between them, so that each of the
ladies had &pound;30,000 of her own; and, bowing to Ph&oelig;be,
he requested her to consider him as her guardian.&nbsp; The
Admiral, highly pleased, offered her his congratulations, and as
soon as she could escape she hastened away, followed by
Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said; taking her
hand; &lsquo;the <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>kindness and pardon were the same,
the intention as good as the deed, as far as <i>he</i> was
concerned.&nbsp; Perhaps you were right.&nbsp; The other way
might have proved a stumbling-block.&rsquo;&nbsp; Speak as he
would, he could not govern the tone of his voice nor the
quivering of his entire frame under the downfall of his
hopes.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be linked her arm in his, and took several
turns in the gallery with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Robin, if I were but of age to divide with
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Ph&oelig;be, that would be unfit for you and for
me.&nbsp; I am only where I was before.&nbsp; I knew I had had my
portion.&nbsp; I ought not to have entertained hopes so
unbefitting.&nbsp; But oh, Ph&oelig;be! that she should be cast
about the world, fragile, sensitive as she is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could have said that a home at the Holt was open
to Lucilla; but this might seem an unkind suggestion, and the
same moment, Sir Bevil was heard impetuously bounding up the
stairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Robert, where are you?&rsquo; he called from
the end of the gallery.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never believed you could
have been so infamously treated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Robert, shocked; &lsquo;I cannot hear
this said.&nbsp; You know it was only want of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not talking of your father.&nbsp; He would have
done his best if he had been allowed.&nbsp; It is your
brother!&mdash;his own confession, mind!&nbsp; He boasted just
now that his father would have done it on the spot, but for his
interference, and expected thanks from all the rest of us for his
care of our interests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the use of telling such things, Acton?&rsquo;
said Robert, forcing his voice to calm rebuke, and grasping the
baluster with an iron-like grip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The use!&nbsp; To mark my detestation of such
conduct!&nbsp; I did my best to show him what I thought of it;
and I believe even Bannerman was astounded at his coolness.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take care the thing is made public!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
move heaven and earth but I&rsquo;ll get you preferment that
shall show how such treatment is looked upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg you will do nothing of the kind!&rsquo; exclaimed
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am heartily obliged to you, Acton.&nbsp;
You gained me the certainty of forgiveness, without which I
should have felt a curse on my work.&nbsp; For the rest, I
complain of nothing.&nbsp; I have had larger means than the
others.&nbsp; I knew I was to look for no more.&nbsp; I prefer my
own cure to any other; and reflection will show you that our
family affairs are not to be made public.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate, your mother might do something.&nbsp; Let
me speak to her.&nbsp; What, not now?&nbsp; Then I will come down
whenever Ph&oelig;be will summon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now, nor ever,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Even if anything were in her power, she could not
understand; and she must not be harassed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will talk that over on our way to town,&rsquo; said
Sir Bevil.&nbsp; &lsquo;I start at once.&nbsp; I will not see
that fellow again, nor, I should think, would you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I stay till Saturday week.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>&lsquo;You had better not.&nbsp; You have been
abominably treated; but this is no time for collisions.&nbsp; You
agree with me, Ph&oelig;be; his absence would be the wisest
course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be knows that annoyance between Mervyn and me
is unhappily no novelty.&nbsp; We shall not revert to the
subject, and I have reasons for staying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not fear,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;Robert always keeps his temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or rather we have the safeguard of being both sullen,
not hot,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides, Mervyn was
right.&nbsp; I have had my share, and have not even the dignity
of being injured.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The need of cooling his partisan was the most effective means
of blunting the sharp edge of his own vexation.&nbsp; Hearing
Mervyn cross the hall, he called to offer to take his share in
some business which they had to transact together.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wait a moment,&rsquo; was the answer; and as Sir Bevil
muttered a vituperation of Mervyn&rsquo;s assurance, he said,
decidedly, &lsquo;Now, once for all, I desire that this matter be
never again named between any of us.&nbsp; Let no one know what
has taken place, and let us forget all but that my father was in
charity with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was more than Sir Bevil was with almost any one, and he
continued to pace the gallery with Ph&oelig;be, devising
impossible schemes of compensation until the moment of his
departure for London.</p>
<p>Robert had not relied too much on his own forbearance.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be met her two brothers at dinner&mdash;one gloomy, the
other melancholy; but neither altering his usual tone towards the
other.&nbsp; Unaware that Robert knew of his father&rsquo;s
designs, nor of their prevention, Mervyn was totally exempt from
compunction, thinking, indeed, that he had saved his father from
committing an injustice on the rest of the family, for the sake
of a fanatical tormentor, who had already had and thrown away
more than his share.&nbsp; Subdued and saddened for the time,
Mervyn was kind to Ph&oelig;be and fairly civil to Robert, so
that there were no disturbances to interfere with the tranquil
intercourse of the brother and sister in their walks in the
woods, their pacings of the gallery, or low-voiced conferences
while their mother dozed.</p>
<p>True to his resolve, Robert permitted no reference to his late
hopes, but recurred the more vigorously to his parish interests,
as though he had never thought of any wife save St.
Matthew&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>Home affairs, too, were matters of anxious concern.&nbsp;
Without much sign of sorrow, or even of comprehension of her
loss, it had suddenly rendered the widow an aged invalid.&nbsp;
The stimulus to exertion removed, there was nothing to rouse her
from the languid torpor of her nature, mental and physical.&nbsp;
Invalid habits gave her sufficient occupation, and she showed no
preference for the company of any one except Ph&oelig;be or her
maid, to whose control her passive nature succumbed.&nbsp; At
<!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>Boodle&rsquo;s bidding, she rose, dressed, ate, drank,
and went to bed; at Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s she saw her other
children, heard Robert read, or signed papers for Mervyn.&nbsp;
But each fresh exertion cost much previous coaxing and subsequent
plaintiveness; and when Ph&oelig;be, anxious to rouse her,
persuaded her to come down-stairs, her tottering steps proved her
feebleness; and though her sons showed her every attention, she
had not been in the drawing-room ten minutes before a nervous
trembling and faintness obliged them to carry her back to her
room.</p>
<p>The family apothecary, a kind old man, declared that there was
nothing seriously amiss, and that she would soon &lsquo;recover
her tone.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was plain that much would fall on
Ph&oelig;be, and Robert was uneasy at leaving her with so little
assistance or comfort at hand.&nbsp; He even wrote to beg his
eldest sister to come for a few weeks till his mother&rsquo;s
health should be improved; but Sir Nicholas did not love the
country in the winter, and Augusta only talked of a visit in the
spring.</p>
<p>Another vexation to Robert was the schoolroom.&nbsp; During
the last few months Bertha had outgrown her childish distaste to
study, and had exerted her mind with as much eagerness as
governess could desire; her translations and compositions were
wonders of ease and acuteness; she had plunged into science, had
no objection to mathematics, and by way of recreation wandered in
German metaphysics.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore rather discouraged this
line, knowing how little useful brain exercise she herself had
derived from Kant and his compeers, but this check was all that
was wanting to give Bertha double zest, and she stunned Robert
with demonstrations about her &lsquo;I&rsquo; and her &lsquo;not
I,&rsquo; and despised him for his contempt of her grand
discoveries.</p>
<p>He begged for a prohibition of the study, but Miss Fennimore
thought this would only lend it additional charms, and added that
it was a field which the intellect must explore for itself, and
not take on the authority of others.&nbsp; When this answer was
reported through Ph&oelig;be, Robert shrugged his shoulders,
alarmed at the hot-bed nurture of intellect and these concessions
to mental independence, only balanced by such loose and
speculative opinions as Miss Fennimore had lately manifested to
him.&nbsp; Decidedly, he said, there ought to be a change of
governess and system.</p>
<p>But Ph&oelig;be, tears springing into her eyes, implored him
not to press it.&nbsp; She thoroughly loved her kind,
clear-headed, conscientious friend, who had assisted her so
wisely and considerately through this time of trouble, and knew
how to manage Maria.&nbsp; It was no time for a fresh parting,
and her mother was in no state to be harassed by
alterations.&nbsp; This Robert allowed with a sigh, though delay
did not suit with his stern, uncompromising youthfulness, and he
went on to say, &lsquo;You will bear it in mind,
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; There and elsewhere great changes are
needed.&nbsp; This great, disorderly household is a heavy
charge.&nbsp; <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>Acting for my mother, as you will
have to do, how are you to deal with the servants?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None of them come in my way, except dear old Lieschen,
and Boodle, and Mrs. Brisbane, and they are all kind and
thoughtful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surface work, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Taking my
mother&rsquo;s place, as you do now, you will, or ought to,
become aware of the great mischiefs below stairs, and I trust you
will be able to achieve a great reformation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope&mdash;&rsquo; Ph&oelig;be looked startled, and
hesitated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely, Robert, you do not think I ought
to search after such things.&nbsp; Would it be dutiful, so young
as I am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you are right,&rsquo; said Robert; &lsquo;only,
Ph&oelig;be, Ph&oelig;be, never let toleration harden you to be
indifferent to evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor child, you are in for a world of
perplexities!&nbsp; I wish I had not to leave you to
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every labyrinth has a clue,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
smiling; &lsquo;as Miss Fennimore says when she gives us problems
to work.&nbsp; Only you know the terms of the problem must be
stated before the solution can be made out; so it is of no use to
put cases till we know all the terms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Sufficient unto the day is
the evil thereof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot see the evil yet,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;the trouble has brought so much comfort.&nbsp; That happy
Sunday with you, and my own year of being with them both, have
been such blessings!&nbsp; Last year, how much worse it would
have been for us all, when I scarcely knew mamma or Mervyn, and
could not go about alone nor to church!&nbsp; And Miss Charlecote
will soon come home.&nbsp; There is so much cause for
thankfulness, that I can&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert said no more, but felt that innocent buoyancy a mystery
to his lower-pitched spirit.&nbsp; Never very gay or merry,
Ph&oelig;be had a fund of happiness and a power of finding and
turning outwards the bright side, which made her a most
comfortable companion.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<blockquote><p>Happy are they that learn in Him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though patient suffering teach<br />
The secret of enduring strength,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And praise too deep for speech:<br />
<i>Peace</i> that no pressure from without,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No strife within can reach.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">A. L. Waring</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well was it for Ph&oelig;be that she had been trained to
monotony, for her life was most uniform after Robert had left
home.&nbsp; Her schoolroom mornings, her afternoons with her
mother, her evenings with Mervyn, were all so much alike that one
week could hardly be distinguished from another.&nbsp;
Bertha&rsquo;s vagaries and Mervyn&rsquo;s periodical journeys to
London were the <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>chief varieties, certainly not her
mother&rsquo;s plaintiveness, her brother&rsquo;s discontent, or
the sacrifice of her own inclinations, which were pretty certain
to be traversed, but then, as she said, something else happened
that did as well as what she had wished.</p>
<p>One day, when Mervyn had been hunting, and had come home
tired, he desired her to give him some music in the
evening.&nbsp; She took the opportunity of going over some fine
old airs, which the exigencies of drawing-room display had
prevented her from practising for some time.&nbsp; Presently she
found him standing by her, his face softer than usual.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where did you get that, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Haydn&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I learnt it just after Miss
Fennimore came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Play it again; I have not heard it for
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed, and looked at him.&nbsp; He was shading his face
with his hand, but he hardly spoke again all the rest of the
evening.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s curiosity was roused, and she tried the
effect of the air on her mother, whose great pleasure was her
daughter&rsquo;s music, since a piano had been moved into her
dressing-room.&nbsp; But it awoke no association there, and
&lsquo;Thank you, my dear,&rsquo; was the only requital.</p>
<p>While the next evening she was wondering whether to volunteer
it, Mervyn begged for it, and as she finished, asked, &lsquo;What
does old Gay say of my mother now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He thinks her decidedly better, and so I am sure she
is.&nbsp; She has more appetite.&nbsp; She really ate the breast
of a partridge to-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says nothing of a change?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She could not bear the journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It strikes me that she wants rousing.&nbsp; Shut up in
a great lonely house like this, she has nothing cheerful to look
at.&nbsp; She would be much better off at Brighton, or some of
those places where she could see people from the windows, and
have plenty of twaddling old dowager society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did ask Mr. Gay about the sea, but he thought the
fatigue of the journey, and the vexing her by persuading her to
take it, would do more harm than the change would do
good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not mean only as a change.&nbsp; I believe she
would be much happier living there, with this great place off her
hands.&nbsp; It is enough to depress any one&rsquo;s spirits to
live in a corner like a shrivelled kernel in a nut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go away!&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mervyn! it is her home!&nbsp; It is her own!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I never said otherwise,&rsquo; he answered,
rather crossly; &lsquo;but you know very well that it is a farce
to talk of her managing the house, or the estate either.&nbsp; It
was bad enough before, but there will be no check on any one
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you looked after things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I to spend my life as a steward?&nbsp; No, if the
work is to be in my hands, I ought to be in possession at once,
so as to take my place in the county as I ought, and cut the City
business.&nbsp; <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>The place is a mere misfortune and
encumbrance to her as she is, and she would be ten times happier
at a watering-place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn, what do you mean?&nbsp; You have all the power
and consequence here, and are fully master of all; but why should
not poor mamma live in her own house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you conceive that a man may have reasons
for wishing to be put in possession of the family place when he
can enjoy it, and she can&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look at me
with that ridiculous face.&nbsp; I mean to marry.&nbsp; Now,
can&rsquo;t you see that I may want the house to
myself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are engaged!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; I am waiting to see my way through
the bother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it?&nbsp; Tell me about it, Mervyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, but for your life
don&rsquo;t say a word to any one.&nbsp; I would never forgive
you, if you set my Ladies Bannerman and Acton at me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was alarmed.&nbsp; She had little hope that their
likings would coincide; his manner indicated defiance of opinion,
and she could not but be averse to a person for whose sake he
wished to turn them out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; was all she
could say, and he proceeded: &lsquo;I suppose you never heard of
Cecily Raymond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of Moorcroft?&rsquo; she asked, breathing more
freely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir John&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, his niece.&nbsp; It is a spooney thing to take up
with one&rsquo;s tutor&rsquo;s daughter, but it can&rsquo;t be
helped.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried to put her out of my head, and
enter on a more profitable speculation, but it won&rsquo;t
work!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she very pretty&mdash;prettier than Lucilla
Sandbrook?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be, unable to believe that any
other inducement could attach him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not what you would call pretty at all, except her
eyes.&nbsp; Not a bit fit to make a figure in the world, and a
regular little parsoness.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the deuce of
it.&nbsp; It would be mere misery to her to be taken to London
and made to go into society; so I want to have it settled, for if
she could come here and go poking into cottages and schools, she
would want nothing more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she is very good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You and she will be devoted to each other.&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;ll stand up for her, I know, and then a fig for their
two ladyships.&nbsp; You and I can be a match for Juliana, if she
tries to bully my mother.&nbsp; Not that it matters.&nbsp; I am
my own man now; but Cecily is crotchety, and must not be
distressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I am sure she would not like to turn mamma
out,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, stoutly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that is the reason I want to have
it settled beforehand.&nbsp; If she were a party to it, she would
never consent; she would be confoundedly scrupulous, and we
should be all worried to death.&nbsp; Come, you just sound my
mother; you can do anything with her, and it will be better for
you all.&nbsp; You will be bored to death here, seeing no
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>&lsquo;I do not know whether it be a right proposal to
make.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right?&nbsp; If the place had been my father&rsquo;s,
it would be a matter of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That makes the whole difference.&nbsp; And even so,
would not this be very soon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you know I am proposing nothing at
once.&nbsp; It would not be decent, I suppose, to marry within
the half-year; but, poor little thing, I can&rsquo;t leave her in
suspense any longer.&nbsp; You should not have played that
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you know that she cares for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed consciously at this home question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be a long time since you were at Mr.
Raymond&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eight years; but I have made flying visits there since,
and met her at her uncle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Poor little thing, she
was horribly gone off last time, and very ungracious, but we will
find a remedy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you could not gain consent to it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It never came to that.&nbsp; I never committed
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why not?&nbsp; If she was so good, and you liked
her, and they all wanted you to marry, I can&rsquo;t see why you
waited, if you knew, too, that she liked you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think it was kind, Mervyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! women always hang by one another.&nbsp; See here,
Ph&oelig;be, it began when I was as green as yourself, a mere
urchin, and she a little unconscious thing of the same age.&nbsp;
Well, when I got away, I saw what a folly it was&mdash;a mere
throwing myself away!&nbsp; I might have gone in for rank or
fortune, as I liked; and how did I know that I was such a fool
that I could not forget her?&nbsp; If Charles Charteris had not
monopolized the Jewess, I should have been done for long
ago!&nbsp; And apart from that, I wasn&rsquo;t ready for domestic
joys, especially to be Darby to such a pattern little Joan, who
would think me on the highway to perdition if she saw
<i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i> on the table, or heard me bet a pair of
gloves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t have any affection for her,&rsquo;
cried Ph&oelig;be, indignantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you she spoilt the taste of every
other transaction of the sort?&nbsp; And what am I going to do
now?&nbsp; When she has not a halfpenny, and I might marry
anybody!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you cared for her properly, you would have done it
long before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a dutiful son,&rsquo; he answered, in an
indifferent voice, that provoked Ph&oelig;be to say with spirit,
&lsquo;I hope she does not care for you, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Past praying for, kind sister.&nbsp; Sincerely
I&rsquo;ve been sorry for it; I would have disbelieved it, but
the more she turns away, the better I know it; so you see, after
all, I shall deserve to be ranked with your hero, Bevil
Acton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn, you make me so angry that I can hardly
answer!&nbsp; You boast of what you think she has suffered for
you all this time, and make light of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault if my poor father would send
such an amiable youth into a large family.&nbsp; Men with
daughters should <!-- page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>not take pupils.&nbsp; I did my best
to cure both her and myself, but I had better have fought it out
at once when she was younger and prettier, and might have been
more conformable, and not so countrified, as you&rsquo;ll grow,
Ph&oelig;be, if you stay rusting here, nursing my mother and
reading philosophy with Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; If you set up to
scold me, you had better make things easy for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be thought for a few moments, and then said, &lsquo;I
see plainly what you ought to do, but I cannot understand that
this makes it proper to ask my mother to give up her own house,
that she was born to.&nbsp; I suppose you would call it childish
to propose your living with us; but we could almost form two
establishments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear child, Cecily would go and devote herself to my
mother.&nbsp; I should never have any good out of her, and she
would get saddled for life with Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maria is my charge,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
coldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what will your husband say to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall never be my husband unless I have the means of
making her happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, there would be a frenzy of mutual generosity, and
she would be left to us.&nbsp; No; I&rsquo;m not going to set up
housekeeping with Maria for an ingredient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is the Underwood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Designed by nature for a dowager-house.&nbsp; That
would do very well for you and my mother, though Cheltenham or
Brighton might be better.&nbsp; Yes, it might do.&nbsp; You would
be half a mile nearer your dear Miss Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, a little
sarcastically; but repenting she added, &lsquo;Mervyn, I hope I
do not seem unkind and selfish; but I think we ought to consider
mamma, as she cannot stand up for herself just now.&nbsp; It is
not unlikely that when mamma hears you are engaged, and has seen
and grown fond of Miss Raymond, she may think herself of giving
up this place; but it ought to begin from her, not from you; and
as things are now, I could not think of saying anything about
it.&nbsp; From what you tell me of Miss Raymond, I don&rsquo;t
think she would be the less likely to take you without Beauchamp
than with it; indeed, I think you must want it less for her sake
than your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, Mrs. Ph&oelig;be, you are a cool
hand!&rsquo; exclaimed Mervyn, laughing; &lsquo;but you promise
to see what can be done as soon as I&rsquo;ve got my hand into
the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promise nothing,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;I
hope it will be settled without me, for I do not know what would
be the most right or most kind, but it may be plainer when the
time comes, and she, who is so good, will be sure to know.&nbsp;
O Mervyn, I am very glad of that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be sought the west wing in such a tingle of emotion
that she only gave Miss Fennimore a brief good night instead of
lingering to talk over the day.&nbsp; Indignation was
foremost.&nbsp; <!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>After destroying Robert&rsquo;s
hopes for life, here was Mervyn accepting wedded happiness as a
right, and after having knowingly trifled with a loving heart for
all these years, coolly deigning to pick it up, and making terms
to secure his own consequence and freedom from all natural
duties, and to thrust his widowed mother from her own home.&nbsp;
It was Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s first taste of the lesson so bitter to
many, that her parents&rsquo; home was not her own for life, and
the expulsion seemed to her so dreadful that she rebuked herself
for personal feeling in her resentment, and it was with a sort of
horror that she bethought herself that her mother might possibly
prefer a watering-place life, and that it would then be her part
to submit cheerfully.&nbsp; Poor Miss Charlecote! would not she
miss her little moonbeam?&nbsp; Yes, but if this Cecily were so
good, she would make up to her.&nbsp; The pang of suffering and
dislike quite startled Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; She knew it for
jealousy, and hid her face in prayer.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and Mervyn made the unprecedented
exertion of going twice to church, observing that he was getting
into training.&nbsp; He spent the evening in dwelling on Cecily
Raymond, who seemed to have been the cheerful guardian elder
sister of a large family in narrow circumstances, and as great a
contrast to Mervyn himself as was poor Lucilla to Robert; her
homeliness and seriousness being as great hindrances to the elder
brother, as fashion and levity to the younger.&nbsp; It was as if
each were attracted by the indefinable essence, apart from all
qualities, that constitutes the self; and Haydn&rsquo;s air,
learnt long ago by Cecily as a surprise to her father on his
birthday, had evoked such a healthy shoot of love within the last
twenty-four hours, that Mervyn was quite transformed, though
still rather unsuitably sensible of his own sacrifice, and of the
favour he was about to confer on Cecily in entering on that
inevitable period when he must cease to be a gentleman at
large.</p>
<p>On Monday he came down to breakfast ready for a journey, as
Ph&oelig;be concluded, to London.&nbsp; She asked if he would
return by the next hunting day.&nbsp; He answered vaguely, then
rousing himself, said, &lsquo;I say, Ph&oelig;be, you must write
her a cordial sisterly sort of letter, you know; and you might
make Bertha do it too, for nobody else will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote to Juliana on Friday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Juliana!&nbsp; Are you mad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Miss Raymond!&nbsp; But you told me you had said
nothing!&nbsp; You have not had time since Friday night to get an
answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Foolish child, no; but I shall be there to-night or
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going to Sutton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and, as I told you, I trust to you to write such a
letter as to make her feel comfortable.&nbsp; Well, what&rsquo;s
the use of having a governess, if you don&rsquo;t know how to
write a letter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mervyn, I&rsquo;ll write, only I must hear from
you first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate writing.&nbsp; I tell you, if you
write&mdash;let me see, on Wednesday, you may be sure it is all
over.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>&lsquo;No, Mervyn, I will not be so impertinent,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be, and the colour rushed into her face as she
recollected the offence that she had once given by manifesting a
brother&rsquo;s security of being beloved.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would
be insulting her to assume that she had accepted you, and write
before I knew, especially after the way you have been using
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw! she will only want a word of kindness; but if
you are so fanciful, will it do if I put a cover in the
post?&nbsp; There! and when you get it on Wednesday morning, you
write straight off to Cecily, and when you have got the notion
into my mother&rsquo;s understanding, you may write to me, and
tell me what chance there is of Beauchamp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What chance of Beauchamp!&nbsp; The words made
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s honest brow contract as she stood by the
chimney-piece, while her brother went out into the hall.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all he cares for,&rsquo; she thought.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Poor mamma!&nbsp; But, oh! how unkind.&nbsp; I am sending
him away without one kind wish, and she must be good&mdash;so
much better than I could have hoped!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Out she ran, and as he paused to kiss her bright cheek, she
whispered, &lsquo;Good-bye, Mervyn; good speed.&nbsp; I shall
watch for your cover.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She received another kiss for those words, and they had been
an effort, for those designs on Beauchamp weighed heavily on her,
and the two tasks that were left to her were not congenial.&nbsp;
She did not know how to welcome a strange sister, for whose sake
the last of the Mervyns was grudged her own inheritance, and
still less did she feel disposed to harass her mother with a new
idea, which would involve her in bewilderment and
discussion.&nbsp; She could only hope that there would be
inspiration in Mervyn&rsquo;s blank cover, and suppress her fever
for suspense.</p>
<p>Wednesday came&mdash;no cover, blank or unblank.&nbsp; Had he
been taken with a fit of diffidence, and been less precipitate
than he intended?&nbsp; Womanhood hoped so, and rather enjoyed
the possibility of his being kept a little in suspense.&nbsp; Or
suppose he had forgotten his cover, and then should think the
absence of a letter her fault?&nbsp; Thursday&mdash;still no
tidings.&nbsp; Should she venture a letter to him?&nbsp; No;
lovers were inexplicable people, and after all, what could she
say?&nbsp; Perhaps he was only waiting for an opportunity, and if
Cecily had been ungracious at the last meeting, she might not
afford one.&nbsp; Day after day wore on, and still the post-bag
was emptied in vain, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s patience was kept on
tenterhooks, till, when a full fortnight had passed, she learnt
through the servants that Mr. Mervyn&rsquo;s wardrobe and valet,
grooms and horses, had been sent for to London.</p>
<p>So he had been refused, and could not bear to tell her
so!&nbsp; And here she was disappointed and pitying, and as vexed
with Miss Raymond as if it had not been no more than he
deserved.&nbsp; But poor Mervyn! he had expected it so little,
and had been so really attached, that Ph&oelig;be was heartily
grieved for him, and longed to know how he bore it.&nbsp; Nay,
with all the danger <!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>of removal, the flatness of the
balked excitement was personally felt, and Ph&oelig;be would have
been glad, in her monotonous life, of something to hope or to
fear.</p>
<p>Her greatest pleasure was in Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
return.&nbsp; The long watch over her old friend was over.&nbsp;
Honor had shared his wife&rsquo;s cares, comforted and supported
her in her sorrow, and had not left her till the move from her
parsonage was made, and she was settled among her own
relations.&nbsp; Much as Honor had longed to be with Ph&oelig;be,
the Savilles had nearer claims, and she could not part with them
while there was any need of her.&nbsp; Indeed, Mr. Saville, as
once the husband of Sarah Charlecote, the brother-in-law of
Humfrey, and her own friend and adviser, was much esteemed and
greatly missed.&nbsp; She felt as if her own generation were
passing away, when she returned to see the hatchment upon
Beauchamp, and to hear of the widow&rsquo;s failing health.&nbsp;
Knowing how closely Ph&oelig;be was attending her mother, Honor
drove to Beauchamp the first day after her return, and had not
crossed the hall before the slender black figure was in her
arms.</p>
<p>Friends seem as though they must meet to know one another
again, and begin afresh, after one of the great sorrows of life
has fallen on either side, and especially when it is a first
grief, a first taste of that cup of which all must drink.&nbsp;
As much of the child as could pass from Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
sweet, simple nature had passed in those hours that had made her
the protector and nurse of her mother, and though her open eyes
were limpid and happy as before, and the contour of the rounded
cheek and lip as youthful and innocent, yet the soft gravity of
the countenance was deepened, and there was a pensiveness on the
brow, as though life had begun to unfold more difficulties than
pleasures.</p>
<p>And Honor Charlecote?&nbsp; That ruddy golden hair, once
Owen&rsquo;s pride, was mingled with many a silvery thread, and
folded smoothly on a forehead paler, older, but calmer than once
it had been.&nbsp; Sorrow and desertion had cut deeply, and worn
down the fair comeliness of heathful middle age; but something of
compensation there was in the less anxious eye, from which had
passed a certain restless, strained expression; and if the face
were more habitually sad, it was more peaceful.&nbsp; She did not
love less those whom she &lsquo;had seen,&rsquo; but He whom she
&lsquo;had not seen&rsquo; had become her rest and her reliance,
and in her year of loneliness and darkness, a trust, a support, a
confiding joy had sprung up, such as she had before believed in,
but never experienced.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her Best, her All;&rsquo;
those had been words of devotional aspiration before, they were
realities at last.&nbsp; And it was that peace that breathed into
her fresh energy to work and love on, unwearied by
disappointment, but with renewed willingness to spend and be
spent, to rejoice with those who rejoiced, to weep with them that
wept, to pray and hope for those who had wrung her heart.</p>
<p>Her tears were flowing as she tenderly embraced Ph&oelig;be,
and <!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>the girl clung fast to her, not
weeping, but full of warm, sweet emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Miss
Charlecote, now you are come, I have help and comfort!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear one, I have grieved to be away, but I could not
leave poor Mrs. Saville.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I know you could not; and it is better to have
you now than even at the time.&nbsp; It is a new, fresh pleasure,
when I can enjoy it better.&nbsp; And I feel as if we had a right
to you now&mdash;since you know what I told you,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, with her pretty, shy, lover-like colouring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you are Humfrey&rsquo;s ward?&mdash;my legacy from
him?&nbsp; Good!&rsquo; said Honora, ratifying the inheritance
with a caress, doubly precious to one so seldom fondled.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Though I am afraid,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;that Mr.
Crabbe would not exactly recognize my claim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want you for what Mr. Crabbe can do
for us, but it does make me feel right and at ease in telling you
of what might otherwise seem too near home.&nbsp; But he was
intended to have taken care of us all, and you always seem to me
one with him&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be stopped short, startled at the deep, bright,
girlish blush on her friend&rsquo;s cheek, and fearing to have
said what she ought not; but Honor, recovering in a moment, gave
a strange bright smile and tightly squeezed her hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;One with him!&nbsp; Dear Ph&oelig;be, thank you.&nbsp; It
was the most undeserved, unrequited honour of my life that he
would have had it so.&nbsp; Yes, I see how you look at me in
wonder, but it was my misfortune not to know on whom or what to
set my affections till too late.&nbsp; No; don&rsquo;t try to
repent of your words.&nbsp; They are a great pleasure to me, and
I delight to include you in the charges I had from him&mdash;the
nice children he liked to meet in the woods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I wish I could remember those meetings.&nbsp;
Robert does, and I do believe Robert&rsquo;s first beginning of
love and respect for what was good was connected with his
fondness for Mr. Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always regard Bertha as a godchild inherited from
him, like Charlecote Raymond, whom I saw ordained last
week.&nbsp; I could not help going out of my way when I found I
might be present, and take his sister Susan with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You went.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Susan had been staying with her uncle at Sutton,
and met me at Oxford.&nbsp; I am glad we were able to go.&nbsp;
There was nothing that I more wished to have seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Irrepressible curiosity could not but cause Ph&oelig;be to ask
how lately Miss Raymond had been at Sutton, and as Miss
Charlecote answered the question she looked inquisitively at her
young friend, and each felt that the other was initiated.&nbsp;
Whether the cousin ought to have confided to Miss Charlecote what
she had witnessed at Sutton was an open question, but at least
Honor knew what Ph&oelig;be burnt to learn, and was ready to
detail it.</p>
<p><!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>It was the old story of the parish priest taking
pupils, and by dire necessity only half fulfilling conflicting
duties, to the sacrifice of the good of all.&nbsp; Overworked
between pupils and flock, while his wife was fully engrossed by
children and household cares, the moment had not been perceived
when their daughter became a woman, and the pupil&rsquo;s sport
grew to earnest.&nbsp; Not till Mervyn Fulmort had left Sutton
for the University were they aware that he had treated Cecily as
the object of his affection, and had promised to seek her as soon
as he should be his own master.&nbsp; How much was in his power
they knew not, but his way of life soon proved him careless of
deserving her, and it was then that she became staid and
careworn, and her youth had lost its bloom, while forced in
conscience to condemn the companion of her girlhood, yet unable
to take back the heart once bestowed, though so long
neglected.</p>
<p>But when Mervyn, declaring himself only set at liberty by his
father&rsquo;s death, appeared at Sutton, Cecily did not waver,
and her parents upheld her decision, that it would be a sin to
unite herself to an irreligious man, and that the absence of
principle which he had shown made it impossible for her to accept
him.</p>
<p>Susan described her as going about the next morning looking as
though some one had been killing her, but going through her
duties as calmly and gently as ever, though preyed on by the
misery of the parting in anger, and the threat that if he were
not good enough for her, he would give her reason to think
so!&nbsp; Honor had pity on the sister, and spared her those
words, but Ph&oelig;be had well-nigh guessed them, and though she
might esteem Cecily Raymond, could not but say mournfully that it
was a last chance flung away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so, my dear.&nbsp; What is right comes right.&nbsp;
A regular life without repentance is sometimes a more hopeless
state than a wilder course, and this rejection may do him more
good than acceptance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is right, I know,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I could advise no one to take poor Mervyn; but surely it
is not wrong to be sorry for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, dear child.&nbsp; It is only the angels who
do not mourn, though they rejoice.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder
whether those who are forgiven, yet have left evil behind them on
earth, are purified by being shown their own errors reduplicating
with time and numbers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Miss Charlecote, do not say so.&nbsp; Once
pardoned, surely fully sheltered, and with no more
punishment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vain speculation, indeed,&rsquo; answered Honor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yet I cannot help thinking of the welcome there must be
when those who have been left in doubt and fear or shipwreck come
safely into haven; above all, for those who here may not have
been able to &ldquo;fetch home their banished.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be pressed her hand, and spoke of trying whether
mamma would see her.</p>
<p><!-- page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought Honora, &lsquo;neither of us
can give perfect sympathy.&nbsp; And it is well.&nbsp; Had my
short-sighted wish taken effect, that sweet face might be clouded
by such grief as poor Cecily Raymond&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Fulmort did see Miss Charlecote, and though speaking
little herself, was gratified by the visit, and the voices
talking before her gave her a sense of sociability.&nbsp; This
preference enabled Ph&oelig;be to enjoy a good deal of quiet
conversation with her friend, and Honora made a point of being at
Beauchamp twice or three times a week, as giving the only variety
that could there be enjoyed.&nbsp; Of Mervyn nothing was heard,
and house and property wanted a head.&nbsp; Matters came to poor
Mrs. Fulmort for decision which were unheard-of mysteries and
distresses to her, even when Ph&oelig;be, instructed by the
steward, did her utmost to explain, and tell her what to
do.&nbsp; It would end by feeble, bewildered looks, and tears
starting on the pale cheeks, and &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my
dear.&nbsp; It goes through my head.&nbsp; Your poor papa
attended to those things.&nbsp; I wish your brother would come
home.&nbsp; Tell them to write to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo; wrote, and Ph&oelig;be wrote, but in vain,
no answer came; and when she wrote to Robert for tidings of
Mervyn&rsquo;s movements, entreating that he would extract a
reply, he answered that he could tell nothing satisfactory of his
brother, and did not know whether he were in town or not; while
as to advising his mother on business, he should only make
mischief by so doing.</p>
<p>Nothing satisfactory!&nbsp; What could that imply?&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be expected soon to hear something positive, for
Bertha&rsquo;s teeth required a visit to London, and Miss
Fennimore was to take her to Lady Bannerman&rsquo;s for a week,
during which the governess would be with some relations of her
own.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be talked of the snugness of being alone with her
mother and Maria, and she succeeded in keeping both pleased with
one another.&nbsp; The sisters walked in the park, and brought
home primroses and periwinkles, which their mother tenderly
handled, naming the copses they came from, well known to her in
childhood, though since her marriage she had been too grand to be
allowed the sight of a wild periwinkle.&nbsp; In the evening
Ph&oelig;be gave them music, sang infant-school hymns with Maria,
tried to teach her piquet; and perceived the difference that the
absence of Bertha&rsquo;s teasing made in the poor girl&rsquo;s
temper.&nbsp; All was very quiet, but when good night was said,
Ph&oelig;be felt wearied out, and chid herself for her accesses
of yawning, nay, she was shocked at her feeling of disappointment
and tedium when the return of the travellers was delayed for a
couple of days.</p>
<p>When at length they came, the variety brightened even Mrs.
Fulmort, and she was almost loquacious about some mourning
pocket-handkerchiefs with chess-board borders, that they were to
bring.&nbsp; The girls all drank tea with her, Bertha <!-- page
339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>pouring out a whole flood of chatter in unrestraint,
for she regarded her mother as nobody, and loved to astonish her
sisters, so on she went, a slight hitch in her speech giving a
sort of piquancy to her manner.</p>
<p>She had dined late every day, she had ridden with Sir Bevil in
the Park, her curly hair had been thought to be
<i>cr&eacute;p&eacute;</i>, she had drunk champagne, she would
have gone to the Opera, but the Actons were particular, and said
it was too soon&mdash;so tiresome, one couldn&rsquo;t do anything
for this mourning.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, in an admonitory tone,
suggested that she had seen the British Museum.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, I have it all in my note-book.&nbsp; Only
imagine, Ph&oelig;be, Sir Nicholas had been at Athens, and knew
nothing about the Parthenon!&nbsp; And, gourmet as he is, and so
long in the Mediterranean, he had no idea whether the Spartan
black broth was made with sepia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; began her mother, &lsquo;young ladies
do not talk learning in society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a simple thing as this, mamma, every one must
know.&nbsp; But they are all so unintellectual!&nbsp; Not a book
about the Bannermans&rsquo; house except Soyer and the London
Directory, and even Bevil had never read the <i>Old Red
Sandstone</i> nor Sir Charles Lyell.&nbsp; I have no opinion of
the science of soldiers or sailors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have told us nothing of Juliana&rsquo;s
baby,&rsquo; interposed Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s exactly like the Goddess Pasht, in the
Sydenham Palace!&nbsp; Juliana does not like her a bit, because
she is only a girl, and Bevil quite worships her.&nbsp;
Everything one of them likes, the other hates.&nbsp; They are a
study of the science of antipathies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not fancy things, Bertha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no fancy; every one is observing it.&nbsp;
Augusta says she has only twice found them together in their own
house since Christmas, and Mervyn says it is a warning against
virulent constancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you saw Mervyn?&rsquo; anxiously asked
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only twice.&nbsp; He is at deadly feud with the Actons,
because Bevil takes Robert&rsquo;s part, and has been lecturing
him about the withdrawing all the subscriptions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I thought Robert told you all, but there has been
such a row!&nbsp; I believe poor papa said something about
letting Robert have an evening school for the boys and young men
at the distillery, but when he claimed it, Mervyn said he knew
nothing about it, and wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it, and got
affronted, so he withdrew all the subscriptions from the
charities and everything else, and the boys have been mobbing the
clergy, and Juliana says it is all Robert&rsquo;s
fault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And did you see Robert?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>&lsquo;Very little.&nbsp; No one would come to such an
old fogy&rsquo;s as Sir Nicholas, that could help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha, my dear, young ladies do not use such
words,&rsquo; observed her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, mamma, you are quite behindhand.&nbsp; Slang is the
thing.&nbsp; I see my line when I come out.&nbsp; It would not do
for you, Ph&oelig;be&mdash;not your style&mdash;but I shall sport
it when I come out and go to the Actons.&nbsp; I shall go out
with them.&nbsp; Augusta is too slow, and lives with nothing but
old admirals and <i>gourmands</i>; but I&rsquo;ll always go to
Juliana for the season, Ph&oelig;be, wear my hair in the Eugenie
style, and be piquante.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps things will be altered by that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no.&nbsp; There will be no retrograde
movement.&nbsp; Highly educated women have acquired such a
footing that they may do what they please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we highly educated women?&rsquo; asked Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure you ought to be, my dear.&nbsp; Nothing was
grudged for your education,&rsquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll always play at bagatelle, and
have a German band at the door,&rsquo; quoth Maria,
conclusively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you go to St. Matthew&rsquo;s?&rsquo; again
interrupted Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Bevil took me.&nbsp; It is the oddest place.&nbsp;
A white brick wall with a red cross built into it over the gate,
and the threshold is just a step back four or five hundred
years.&nbsp; A court with buildings all round, church, schools,
and the curates&rsquo; rooms.&nbsp; Such a sitting-room; the
floor matted, and a great oak table, with benches, where they all
dine, schoolmaster, and orphan boys, and all, and the best boy
out of each class.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a common room, like one at a college,&rsquo;
explained Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Robert has his own rooms
besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a hole!&rsquo; continued Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is the worst of all the curates&rsquo; sitting-rooms, looking out
into the nastiest little alley.&nbsp; It was a shame he did not
have the first choice, when it is all his own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps that is the reason he took the worst,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A study in extremes,&rsquo; said Bertha.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Their dinner was our luncheon&mdash;the very plainest
boiled beef, the liquor given away and at dinner, at the
Bannermans&rsquo;, there were more fine things than Bevil said he
could appreciate, and Augusta looking like a full-blown
dahlia.&nbsp; I was always wanting to stick pins into her arms,
to see how far in the bones are.&nbsp; I am sure I could bury the
heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here, seeing her mother look exhausted, Ph&oelig;be thought it
wise to clear the room; and after waiting a few minutes to soothe
her, left her to her maid.&nbsp; Bertha had waited for her
sister, and clinging round her, said, &lsquo;Well, Ph&oelig;be,
aren&rsquo;t you glad of us?&nbsp; Have you seen a living
creature?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote twice, Mr. Henderson once, besides all
the congregation on Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Matter-of-fact Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; Perhaps you can bear
it, but does <!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>not your mind ache, as if it had
been held down all this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that it can&rsquo;t expand to your grand
intellect?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no great self-conceit to hope one is better
company than Maria!&nbsp; But come, before we fall under the
dominion of the Queen of the West Wing, I have a secret for
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, after a longer stammer than usual,
&lsquo;How should you like a French sister-in-law?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Bertha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ve not had my opportunities.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve seen her&mdash;both of them.&nbsp; Juliana says the
mother is his object; Augusta, the daughter.&nbsp; The mother is
much the most brilliant; but then she has a husband&mdash;a mere
matter of faith, for no one ever sees him.&nbsp; Mervyn is going
to follow them to Paris, that&rsquo;s certain, as soon as the
Epsom day is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only in the Park&mdash;oh, no! not in a room!&nbsp;
Their ladyships would never call on Madame la Marquise; she is
not received, you know.&nbsp; I heard the sisters talk it all
over when they fancied me reading, and wonder what they should do
if it should turn out to be the daughter.&nbsp; But then Juliana
thinks Mervyn might never bring her home, for he is going on at
such a tremendous rate, that it is the luckiest thing our
fortunes do not depend on the business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be looked quite appalled as she entered the
schoolroom, not only at Mervyn&rsquo;s fulfilment of his threat,
but at Bertha&rsquo;s flippancy and shrewdness.&nbsp; Hitherto
she had been kept ignorant of evil, save what history and her own
heart could tell her.&nbsp; But these ten days had been spent in
so eagerly studying the world, that her girlish chatter was
fearfully precocious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little edged tool,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, when
she talked her over afterwards with Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wish I could have been with her at Lady Bannerman&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
It is an unsafe age for a glimpse of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it may soon be forgotten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will never be forgotten&rsquo; said Miss
Fennimore.&nbsp; &lsquo;With so strong a relish for society, such
keen satire, and reasoning power so much developed, I believe
nothing but the devotional principle could subdue her enough to
make her a well-balanced woman.&nbsp; How is that to be
infused?&mdash;that is the question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; pursued the governess, &lsquo;that
devotional temper is in most cases dependent upon uncomprising,
exclusive faith.&nbsp; I have sometimes wondered whether Bertha,
coming into my hands so young as she did, can have imbibed my
distaste to dogma; though, as you know, I have made a point of
non-interference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should shudder to think of any doubts in poor little
Bertha&rsquo;s mind,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
believe it is rather that she does not think about the
matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will read Butler&rsquo;s <i>Analogy</i> with
her,&rsquo; exclaimed Miss <!-- page 342--><a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>Fennimore.&nbsp; &lsquo;I read it long ago, and shall
be glad to satisfy my own mind by going over it again.&nbsp; It
is full time to endeavour to form and deepen Bertha&rsquo;s
convictions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, almost to herself,
&lsquo;that all naughtiness is the want of living
faith&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Fennimore, instead of answering, had gone to another
subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen St. Matthew&rsquo;s,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Robert?&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bertha did not say you were with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went alone.&nbsp; No doubt your brother found me a
great infliction; but he was most kind, and showed me
everything.&nbsp; I consider that establishment a great
fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be showed her gratification.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard him preach,&rsquo; continued Miss
Fennimore.&nbsp; &lsquo;His was a careful and able composition,
but it was his sermon in brick and stone that most impressed
me.&nbsp; Such actions only arise out of strong conviction.&nbsp;
Now, the work of a conviction may be only a proof of the force of
the will that held it; and thus the effect should not establish
the cause.&nbsp; But when I see a young man, brought up as your
brother has been, throwing himself with such energy, self-denial,
and courage into a task so laborious and obscure, I must own
that, such is the construction of the human mind, I am led to
reconsider the train of reasoning that has led to such
results.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s sincere admiration of Robert was
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s one item of comfort.</p>
<p>Gladly she shared it with Miss Charlecote, who, on her side,
knew more than she told Ph&oelig;be of the persecution that
Robert was undergoing from a vestry notoriously under the
influence of the Fulmort firm, whose interest it was to promote
the vice that he came to withstand.&nbsp; Even the lads employed
in the distillery knew that they gratified their employer by
outrages on the clergy and their adherents, and there had been
moments when Robert had been exposed to absolute personal danger,
by mobs stimulated in the gin-shops; their violence against his
attacks on their vicious practices being veiled by a furious
party outcry against his religious opinions.&nbsp; He meanwhile
set his face like a rock, and strong, resolute, and brave, went
his own way, so unmoved as apparently almost to prefer his own
antagonistic attitude, and bidding fair to weary out his enemies
by his coolness, or to disarm them by the charities of which St.
Matthew&rsquo;s was the centre.</p>
<p>As Ph&oelig;be never read the papers, and was secluded from
the world&rsquo;s gossip, it was needless to distress her with
the knowledge of the malignity of the one brother, or the trials
of the other; so Honor obeyed Robert by absolute silence on this
head.&nbsp; She herself gave her influence, her counsel, her
encouragement, and, above all, her prayers, to uphold the youth
who was realizing the dreams of her girlhood.</p>
<p><!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>It might be that the impress of those very dreams had
formed the character she was admiring.&nbsp; Many a weak and
fragile substance, moulded in its softness to a noble shape, has
given a clear and lasting impress to a firm and durable material,
either in the heat of the furnace, or the ductility of
growth.&nbsp; So Robert and Ph&oelig;be, children of the heart
that had lost those of her adoption, cheered these lonely days by
their need of her advice and sympathy.</p>
<p>Nor was she without tasks at home.&nbsp; Mr. Henderson, the
vicar, was a very old man, and was constantly growing more feeble
and unequal to exertion.&nbsp; He had been appointed by the
squire before last, and had the indolent conservative orthodoxy
of the old school, regarding activity as a perilous innovation,
and resisting all Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s endeavours at progress
in the parish.&nbsp; She had had long patience, till, when his
strength failed, she ventured to entreat him to allow her to
undertake the stipend of a curate, but this was rejected with
displeasure, and she was forced to redouble her own exertions;
but neither reading to the sick, visiting the cottages, teaching
at school, nor even setting up a night-school in her own hall,
availed to supply the want of an active pastor and of a resident
magistrate.</p>
<p>Hiltonbury was in danger of losing its reputation as a pattern
parish, which it had retained long after the death of him who had
made it so.&nbsp; The younger race who had since grown up were
not such as their fathers had been, and the disorderly household
at Beauchamp had done mischief.&nbsp; The primitive manners, the
simplicity, and feudal feeling were wearing off, and poor Honor
found the whole charge laid to her few modern steps in
education!&nbsp; If Hiltonbury were better than many of the
neighbouring places, yet it was not what it had been when she
first had known it, and she vexed herself in the attempt to
understand whether the times or herself were the cause.</p>
<p>Even her old bailiff, Brooks, did not second her.&nbsp; He had
more than come to the term of service at which the servant
becomes a master, and had no idea of obeying her, when he thought
he knew best.&nbsp; Backward as were her notions of modern
farming, they were too advanced for him, and either he would not
act on them at all, or was resolved against their success when
coerced.&nbsp; There was no dismissing him, and without Mr.
Saville to come and enforce her authority, Honor found the old
man so stubborn that she had nearly given up the contest, except
where the welfare of men, not of crops, was concerned.</p>
<p>A maiden&rsquo;s reign is a dreary thing, when she tends
towards age.&nbsp; And Honor often felt what it would have been
to have had Owen to back her up, and infuse new spirit and
vigour.</p>
<p>The surly ploughboy, who omitted to touch his cap to the lady,
little imagined the train of painful reflections roused by this
small indication of the altering spirit of the place!</p>

<blockquote><p>Even in our ashes glow the wonted
fires.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gray</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, I did not like the voice that I heard just
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I was not out of temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am sure any one would be vexed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot you tell me what was the matter without being
sure so often?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure&mdash;there, mamma, I beg your pardon&mdash;I
am sure I did not mean to complain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only, Sarah, neither your voice has such a ring, nor
are you so sure, when nothing has gone wrong.&nbsp; What was
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is that photography, mamma.&nbsp; Miss Sandbrook is
so busy with it!&nbsp; I could not copy in my translation that I
did yesterday, because she had not looked over it, and when she
said she was coming presently, I am afraid I said it was always
presently and never present.&nbsp; I believe I did say it
crossly, and I am sorry I denied it,&rsquo; and poor
Sarah&rsquo;s voice was low and meek enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming?&nbsp; Where is she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the dark chamber, doing a positive of the
Cathedral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Prendergast entered the schoolroom, outside which she had
been holding this colloquy.&nbsp; The powerful sun of high summer
was filling the room with barred light through the Venetian
blinds, and revealing a rather confused mass of the appliances of
study, interspersed with saucers of water in which were bathing
paper photographs, and every shelf of books had a fringe of
others on glass set up to dry.&nbsp; On the table lay a paper of
hooks, a three-tailed artificial minnow, and another partly
clothed with silver twist, a fly-book, and a quantity of feathers
and silks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must tell Francis that the schoolroom is no place for
his fishing-tackle!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Prendergast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, mamma, it is Miss Sandbrook&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She is
teaching him to dress flies, because she says he can&rsquo;t be a
real fisherman without, and the trout always rise at hers.&nbsp;
It is quite beautiful to see her throw.&nbsp; That delicate
little hand is so strong and ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A door was opened, and out of the housemaid&rsquo;s closet,
defended from light by a yellow blind at every crevice, came
eager exclamations of &lsquo;Famous,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Capital,&rsquo; &lsquo;The tower comes out to
perfection;&rsquo; and in another moment Lucilla Sandbrook, in
all her bloom and animation, was in the room, followed by a youth
of some eighteen years, Francis Beaumont, an Indian nephew of
Mrs. Prendergast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hit off at last, isn&rsquo;t it, aunt?&nbsp; Those
dog-tooth mouldings will satisfy even the uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really it is very good,&rsquo; said Mrs. Prendergast,
as it was held up to the light for her inspection.</p>
<p><!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>&lsquo;Miss Sandbrook has bewitched the camera,&rsquo;
continued he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you remember the hideous muddles of
last summer?&nbsp; But, oh! Miss Sandbrook, we must have one
more; the sun will be off by and by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only ten minutes,&rsquo; said Lucilla, in a deprecating
tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must not keep me a second more, let the
sun be in ever such good humour.&nbsp; Come, Sarah, come and show
us the place you said would be so good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too hot,&rsquo; said Sarah, bluntly, &lsquo;and I
can&rsquo;t waste the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you pattern-pupil, I&rsquo;ll come
presently.&nbsp; Indeed I will, Mrs. Prendergast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see this translation, Sarah,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Prendergast, as the photographers ran down-stairs.</p>
<p>She looked over it carefully, and as the ten minutes had
passed without sign of the governess&rsquo;s return, asked what
naturally followed in the morning&rsquo;s employment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Italian reading, mamma; but never mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Find the place, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only while Francis is at home.&nbsp; Oh, I wish I
had not been cross.&rsquo;&nbsp; And though Sarah usually loved
to read to her mother, she was uneasy all the time, watching the
door, and pausing to listen at the most moving passages.&nbsp; It
was full half an hour before the voices were heard returning, and
then there was a call, &lsquo;Directly, Sarah!&rsquo; the dark
chamber was shut up, and all subsided.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prendergast stayed on, in spite of an imploring glance
from her daughter, and after an interval of the mysterious
manipulations in the closet, the photograph was borne forth in
triumph.</p>
<p>Lucilla looked a little abashed at finding Mrs. Prendergast in
presence, and began immediately, &lsquo;There, Mr. Beaumont, you
see!&nbsp; I hope Mrs. Prendergast is going to banish you
forthwith; you make us shamefully idle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Prendergast, gravely, &lsquo;I am
going to carry him off at once, and make a law against future
invasions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Francis attempted loud appeals, but his aunt quashed them with
demeanour that showed that she was in earnest, and drove him away
before her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Miss Sandbrook,&rsquo; said Sarah, with
affectionate compunction, &lsquo;I did not mean to speak so loud
and so crossly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Lucilla, leaning back and fanning
herself with her hat, &lsquo;we all know that we reverse the laws
of teacher and pupil!&nbsp; Small blame to you if you were put
out, and now I hope your mamma will keep him to herself, and that
I shall have time to get cool.&nbsp; There! read me some French,
it is a refreshing process&mdash;or practise a little.&nbsp; I
declare that boy has dragged me in and out so often, that I
haven&rsquo;t energy to tell a noun from a verb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Prendergast had hardly descended to the drawing-room <!--
page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>before her husband&rsquo;s voice called her to the
study, where he stood, his broad mouth distended by a broader
smile, his eyes twinkling with merriment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old woman&rsquo; (his favourite name for her),
&lsquo;do you know what a spectacle I have been
witnessing?&rsquo; and as she signed inquiry, &lsquo;Mrs.
Sprydone, with numerous waggings of the head, and winkings of the
eyes, inveigled me into her den, to see&mdash;guess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Francis and Miss Sandbrook in the cloister
photographing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old woman, you are a witch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew what they were about, as well as Mrs.
Sprydone&rsquo;s agony to open my eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So your obstinate blindness drove her to me!&nbsp; She
thought it right that I should be aware The Close, it seems, is
in a fever about that poor girl.&nbsp; What do you know?&nbsp; Is
it all gossip?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know there is gossip, as a law of nature, but I have
not chosen to hear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you think it all nonsense?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not <i>all</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what then?&nbsp; The good ladies seem terribly
scandalized by her dress.&nbsp; Is there any harm in that?&nbsp;
I always thought it very becoming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; said his wife, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is too smart, can&rsquo;t you give her a
hint?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When she left off her mourning, she spoke to me, saying
that she could not afford not to wear out what she already
had.&nbsp; I quite agreed; and though I could wish there were
less stylishness about her, it is pleasant to one&rsquo;s own
eye, and I see nothing to object to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is no concern of the ladies,
then!&nbsp; And how about this lad?&nbsp; One of their wild
notions, is not it?&nbsp; I have heard her tell him half-a-dozen
times that she was six years his elder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four-and-twenty is just the age that young-looking
girls like to boast of.&nbsp; I am not afraid on her account; she
has plenty of sense and principle, and I believe, too, there is a
very sore spot in her heart, poor girl.&nbsp; She plays with him
as a mere boy; but he is just at the time of life for a passion
for a woman older than himself, and his devotion certainly
excites her more than I could wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Peter didn&rsquo;t like it at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Peter was certainly not in a gracious mood when he was
here last week.&nbsp; I could not make out whether seeing her a
governess were too much for him, or whether he suspected me of
ill-using her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; it was rivalry between him and Master
Francis!&rsquo; said the Doctor, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;How he
launched out against young men&rsquo;s conceit when Francis was
singing with her.&nbsp; Sheer jealousy!&nbsp; He could see
nothing but dilapidation, dissent, and dirt at Laneham, and now
has gone and refused it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Refused Laneham!&mdash;that capital college
living!&mdash;with no <!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>better dependence than his
fellowship, and such a curacy as Wrapworth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed he has.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s his letter.&nbsp; You
may read it and give it to Miss Sandbrook if you like&mdash;he
seems quite dispirited.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Too old to enter on a new field of
duties,&rdquo;&rsquo; read Mrs. Prendergast, indignantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, he is but forty-four!&nbsp; What did he think of us
for coming here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Despised me for it,&rsquo; said the Doctor,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind; he will think himself younger
as he grows older&mdash;and one can&rsquo;t blame him for keeping
to Wrapworth as long as the old Dean of --- lives, especially as
those absentee Charterises do so much harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does not expect them to give him the living?&nbsp;
They ought, I am sure, after his twenty years&rsquo; labour there
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not they!&nbsp; Mr. Charteris gratuitously wrote to
tell him that, on hearing of his burying that poor young Mrs.
Sandbrook there, all scruples had been removed, and the next
presentation was offered for sale.&nbsp; You need not tell Miss
Sandbrook so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not; but pray how does Peter mean to avoid
the new field of duty, if he be sure of turning out on the
Dean&rsquo;s death?&nbsp; Oh! I see&mdash;&ldquo;finish his days
at his College, if the changes at the University have not
rendered it insupportable to one who remembers elder and better
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Peter!&nbsp; Well; these are direful
consequences of Miss Sandbrook&rsquo;s fit of flightiness!&nbsp;
Yes, I&rsquo;ll show her the letter, it might tame her a little;
and, poor thing, I own I liked her better when she was soft and
subdued.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&nbsp; Then you are not satisfied?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
go.&nbsp; Let me know how it is.&nbsp; I am sure Sarah is
distracted about her&mdash;more than even Francis.&nbsp; I would
not part with her for a great deal, not only on Peter&rsquo;s
account, but on her own and Sarah&rsquo;s; but these ladies have
raked up all manner of Charteris scandal, and we are quite in
disgrace for bringing her here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Prendergast, &lsquo;while we
lived at our dear old country home, I never quite believed what I
heard of jealous ill-nature, but I have seen how it was ever
since those Christmas parties, when certainly people paid her a
great deal of attention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who would not?&mdash;the prettiest, most agreeable
young woman there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be vexatious to be eclipsed not only in beauty,
but in style, by a strange governess,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Prendergast.&nbsp; &lsquo;That set all the mothers and daughters
against her, and there have been some spiteful little attempts at
mortifying her, which have made Sarah and me angry beyond
description!&nbsp; All that they say only impels me towards
her.&nbsp; She is a rare creature, most engaging, but I do
sometimes fear that I may have spoilt her a little, for she has
certainly not done quite so well of late.&nbsp; At first she
worked hard to keep in advance of Sarah, saying how she felt the
disadvantage of superficial learning and desultory habits; she
kept in the background, and avoided amusements; <!-- page
348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>but I suppose reaction is natural with recovered
spirits, and this summer she has taken less pains, and has let
Francis occupy her too much, and&mdash;what I like least of
all&mdash;her inattention brings back the old rubs with
Sarah&rsquo;s temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must take her in hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she were but my daughter or niece!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you had made her feel as such.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This sort of reproof is the difficulty, and brings back
the sense of our relative positions.&nbsp; However, the thing is
to be done as much for her sake as for our own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla knew that a lecture was impending, but she really
loved and esteemed Mrs. Prendergast too much to prepare to champ
the bit.&nbsp; That lady&rsquo;s warmth and simplicity, and,
above all, the largeness of mind that prevented her from
offending or being offended by trifles, had endeared her
extremely to the young governess.&nbsp; Not only had these eight
months passed without the squabble that Owen had predicted would
send her to Hiltonbury in a week, but Cilla had decidedly, though
insensibly, laid aside many of the sentiments and habits in which
poor Honor&rsquo;s opposition had merely confirmed her.&nbsp; The
effect of the sufferings of the past summer had subdued her for a
long time, the novelty of her position had awed her, and what
Mrs. Prendergast truly called the reaction had been so tardy in
coming on that it was a surprise even to herself.&nbsp; Sensible
that she had given cause for displeasure, she courted the
<i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;te</i>, and herself began
thus&mdash;&lsquo;I beg your pardon for my idleness.&nbsp; It is
a fatal thing to be recalled to the two passions of my
youth&mdash;fishing and photography.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband will give Francis employment in the
morning,&rsquo; said Mrs. Prendergast.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will not
do to give Sarah&rsquo;s natural irritability too many excuses
for outbreaks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She never accepts excuses,&rsquo; said Lucilla,
&lsquo;though I am sure she might.&nbsp; I have been a sore trial
to her diligence and methodicalness; and her soul is too much
bent on her work for us to drag her out to be foolish, as would
be best for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it might be for her; but, my dear, pardon me, I am
not speaking only for Sarah&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With an odd jerk of head and hand, Cilly exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh!
the old story&mdash;the other f&mdash;flirting, is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never said that!&nbsp; I never thought that,&rsquo;
cried Mrs. Prendergast, shocked at the word and idea that had
never crossed her mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If not,&rsquo; said Cilla, &lsquo;it is because you are
too innocent to know flirting when you see it!&nbsp; Dear Mrs.
Prendergast, I didn&rsquo;t think you would have looked so
grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not think you would have spoken so lightly; but
it is plain that we do not mean the same thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact, you in your quietness, think awfully of that
which for years was to me like breathing!&nbsp; I thought the
taste was gone for ever, but, you see&rsquo;&mdash;and her sad
sweet expression <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>pleaded for her&mdash;&lsquo;you
have made me so happy that the old self is come
back.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a silence, broken by this strange
girl saying, &lsquo;Well, what are you going to do to
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only,&rsquo; said the lady, in her sweet, full,
impressive voice, &lsquo;to beg you will indeed be happy in
giving yourself no cause for self-reproach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m past that,&rsquo; said Lucilla, with a smile
on her lip and a tear in her eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not
known that sensation since my father died.&nbsp; My chief
happiness since that has lain in being provoking, but you have
taken away that pleasure.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t purposely vex
you, even if I were your adopted child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without precisely knowing the full amount of these words, Mrs.
Prendergast understood past bitterness and present warmth, and,
gratified to find that at least there was no galling at their
mutual relations, responded with a smile and a caress that led
Lucilla to continue&mdash;&lsquo;As for the word that dismayed
you, I only meant to acknowledge an unlucky propensity to be
excited about any nonsense, in which any <i>man</i> kind is mixed
up.&nbsp; If Sarah would take to it, I could more easily abstain,
but you see her coquetries are with nobody more recent than
Horace and Dante.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot wish it to be otherwise with her,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Prendergast gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; It is a bad speculation,&rsquo; said Lucilla,
sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;She will never wish half her life could be
pulled out like defective crochet; nor wear out good
people&rsquo;s forbearance with her antics.&nbsp; I did think
they were outgrown, and beat out of me, and that your nephew was
too young; but I suppose it is ingrain, and that I should be
flattered by the attentions of a he-baby of six months old!&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ll do my best, Mrs. Prendergast; I promise you
I&rsquo;ll not be the schoolmistress abroad in the morning, and
you shall see what terms I will keep with Mr.
Beaumont.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Prendergast was less pleased after than before this
promise.&nbsp; It was again that freedom of expression that the
girl had learnt among the Charterises, and the ideas that she
accepted as mere matters of course, that jarred upon the matron,
whose secluded life had preserved her in far truer
refinement.&nbsp; She did not know how to reply, and, as a means
of ending the discussion, gave her Mr. Prendergast&rsquo;s
letter, but was amazed at her reception of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Passed the living!&nbsp; Famous!&nbsp; He will stick to
Wrapworth to the last gasp!&nbsp; That is fidelity!&nbsp; Pray
tell him so from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better send your message through Dr.
Prendergast.&nbsp; We cannot but be disappointed, though I
understand your feeling for Wrapworth, and we are sorry for the
dispirited tone about the letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well he may be, all alone there, and seeing poor Castle
Blanch going to rack and ruin.&nbsp; I could cry about it
whenever I think of it; but how much worse would it have been if
he had deserted too!&nbsp; As long as he is in the old vicarage
there is <!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 350</span>a home spot to me in the
world!&nbsp; Oh, I thank him, I do thank him for standing by the
old place to the last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is preposterous,&rsquo; thought Mrs.
Prendergast.&nbsp; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t tell the Doctor.&nbsp; He
would think it so foolish in him, and improper in her; I verily
believe it is her influence that keeps him at Wrapworth!&nbsp; He
cannot bear to cross her wishes nor give her pain.&nbsp; Well, I
am thankful that Sarah is neither beautiful nor
attractive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sincere was Lucilla&rsquo;s intention to resume her regular
habits, and put a stop to Francis Beaumont&rsquo;s attentions,
but the attraction had already gone so far that repression
rendered him the more assiduous, and often bore the aspect (if it
were not absolutely the coyness) of coquetry.&nbsp; While
deprecating from her heart any attachment on his part, her vanity
was fanned at finding herself in her present position as
irresistible as ever, and his eagerness to obtain a smile or word
from her was such an agreeable titillation, that everything else
became flat, and her hours in the schoolroom an
imprisonment.&nbsp; Sarah&rsquo;s methodical earnestness in study
bored her, and she was sick of restraint and application.&nbsp;
Nor was this likely to be merely a passing evil, for
Francis&rsquo;s parents were in India, and Southminster was his
only English home.&nbsp; Nay, even when he had returned to his
tutor, Lucilla was not restored to her better self.&nbsp; Her
craving for excitement had been awakened, and her repugnance to
mental exertion had been yielded to.&nbsp; The routine of lessons
had become bondage, and she sought every occasion of variety,
seeking to outshine and dazzle the ladies of Southminster,
playing off Castle Blanch fascinations on curates and minor
canons, and sometimes flying at higher game, even beguiling the
Dean himself into turning over her music when she sang.</p>
<p>She had at first, by the use of all her full-grown faculties,
been just able to keep sufficiently ahead of her pupil; but her
growing indolence soon caused her to slip back, and not only did
she let Sarah shoot ahead of her, but she became impatient of the
girl&rsquo;s habits of accuracy and research; she would give
careless and vexatious answers, insist petulantly on correcting
by the ear, make light of Sarah and her grammar, and hastily
reject or hurry from the maps, dictionaries, and
cyclop&aelig;dias with which Sarah&rsquo;s training had taught
her to read and learn.&nbsp; But her dislike of trouble in
supporting an opinion did not make her the less pertinacious in
upholding it, and there were times when she was wrathful and
petulant at Sarah&rsquo;s presumption in maintaining the
contrary, even with all the authorities in the bookshelves to
back her.</p>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s temper was not her prime quality, and
altercations began to run high.&nbsp; Each dispute that took
place only prepared the way for another, and Mrs. Prendergast,
having taken a governess chiefly to save her daughter from being
fretted by interruptions, found that her annoyances were tenfold
increased, <!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 351</span>and irritations were almost
habitual.&nbsp; They were the more disappointing because the girl
preserved through them all such a passionate admiration for her
beautiful and charming little governess, that, except in the very
height of a squabble, she still believed her perfection, and was
her most vehement partisan, even when the wrong had been chiefly
on the side of the teacher.</p>
<p>On the whole, in spite of this return to old faults, Lucilla
was improved by her residence at Southminster.&nbsp; Defiance had
fallen into disuse, and the habit of respect and affection had
softened her and lessened her pride; there was more devotional
temper, and a greater desire after a religious way of life.&nbsp;
It might be that her fretfulness was the effect of an uneasiness
of mind, which was more hopeful than her previous fierce
self-satisfaction, and that her aberrations were the last efforts
of old evil habits to re-establish their grasp by custom, when
her heart was becoming detached from them.</p>
<p>Be that as it might, Mrs. Prendergast&rsquo;s first duty was
to her child, her second to the nephew intrusted to her, and love
and pity as she might, she felt that to retain Lucilla was
leading all into temptation.&nbsp; Her husband was slow to see
the verification of her reluctant opinion, but he trusted to her,
and it only remained to part as little harshly or injuriously as
might be.</p>
<p>An opening was afforded when, in October, Mrs. Prendergast was
entreated by the widow of one of her brothers to find her a
governess for two girls of twelve and ten, and two boys
younger.&nbsp; It was at a country-house, so much secluded that
such temptations as at Southminster were out of reach, and the
younger pupils were not likely to try her temper in the same way
as Sarah had done.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Prendergast tenderly explained that Sarah, being old
enough to pursue her studies alone, and her sister, Mrs. Willis
Beaumont, being in distress for a governess, it would be best to
transfer Miss Sandbrook to her.&nbsp; Lucilla turned a little
pale, but gave no other sign, only answering, &lsquo;Thank
you,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; at fit moments, and acceding
to everything, even to her speedy departure at the end of a
week.</p>
<p>She left the room in silence, more stunned than even by
Robert&rsquo;s announcement, and with less fictitious strength to
brave the blow that she had brought on herself.&nbsp; She
repaired to the schoolroom, and leaning her brow against the
window-pane, tried to gather her thoughts, but scarcely five
minutes had passed before the door was thrown back, and in rushed
Sarah, passionately exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my fault!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all my
fault!&nbsp; Oh, Miss Sandbrook, dearest Miss Sandbrook, forgive
me!&nbsp; Oh! my temper! my temper!&nbsp; I never
thought&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go to papa!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell him it
is my doing!&nbsp; He will never&mdash;never be so unjust and
cruel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sarah, stand up; let me go, please,&rsquo; said Lucy,
unclasping the hands from her waist.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is not
right.&nbsp; Your father and mother both think the same, and so
do I.&nbsp; It is just that I should go&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>&lsquo;You shan&rsquo;t say so!&nbsp; It is my
crossness!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t let you go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write
to Peter!&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t let you go!&rsquo;&nbsp; Sarah was
really beside herself with despair, and as her mother advanced,
and would have spoken, turned round sharply, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t, mamma; I won&rsquo;t come away unless you promise
not to punish her for my temper.&nbsp; You have minded those
horrid, wicked, gossiping ladies.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think you
would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sarah,&rsquo; said Lucilla, resolutely, &lsquo;going
mad in this way just shows that I am doing you no good.&nbsp; You
are not behaving properly to your mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She never acted unjustly before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not for you to judge, in the first place; and
in the next, she acts justly.&nbsp; I feel it.&nbsp; Yes, Sarah,
I do; I have not done my duty by you, and have quarrelled with
you when your industry shamed me.&nbsp; All my old bad habits are
come back, and your mother is right to part with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! there, mamma; do you hear that?&rsquo; sobbed
Sarah, imploringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;When she speaks in that way, can
you still&mdash;?&nbsp; Oh! I know I was disrespectful, but you
can&rsquo;t&mdash;you can&rsquo;t think that was her
fault!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was,&rsquo; said Lucilla, looking at Mrs.
Prendergast.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know she has lost the self-control
she once had.&nbsp; Sarah, this is of no use.&nbsp; I would go
now, if your mother begged me to stay&mdash;and that,&rsquo; she
added, with her firm smile, &lsquo;she is too wise to do.&nbsp;
If you do not wish to pain me, and put me to shame, do not let me
have any more such exhibitions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pale, ashamed, discomfited, Sarah turned away, and not yet
able to govern herself, rushed into her room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Sarah!&rsquo; said her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have rare powers of making your pupils love you, Miss
Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were for their good,&rsquo; sighed Lucilla.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been much for her good; she is far less uncouth,
and less exclusive.&nbsp; And it will be more so, I hope.&nbsp;
You will still be her friend, and we shall often see you
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla&rsquo;s tears were dropping fast; and looking up, she
said with difficulty&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind this; I know
it is right; I have not deserved the happy home you have given me
here.&nbsp; Where I am less happy, I hope I may keep a better
guard on myself.&nbsp; I thought the old ways had been destroyed,
but they are too strong still, and I ought to suffer for
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never in all her days had Lucilla spoken so humbly!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<blockquote><p>Though she&rsquo;s as like to this one as a crab
is like to an apple,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can tell what I can
tell.&mdash;<i>King Lear</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often a first grief, where sorrow was hitherto been a
stranger, is but the foretaste to many another, like the first
hailstorm, after long sunshine, preluding a succession of
showers, the <!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>clouds returning after the rain, and
obscuring the sky of life for many a day.</p>
<p>Those who daily saw Mrs. Fulmort scarcely knew whether to
attribute her increasing invalidism to debility or want of
spirits; and hopes were built on summer heat, till, when it came,
it prostrated her strength, and at last, when some casual ailment
had confined her to bed, there was no rally.&nbsp; All took
alarm; a physician was called in, and the truth was
disclosed.&nbsp; There was no formed disease; but her
husband&rsquo;s death, though apparently hardly comprehended, had
taken away the spring of life, and she was withering like a
branch severed from the stem.&nbsp; Remedies did but disturb her
torpor by feverish symptoms that hastened her decline, and Dr.
Martyn privately told Miss Charlecote that the absent sons and
daughters ought to be warned that the end must be very near.</p>
<p>Honor, as lovingly and gently as possible, spoke to
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears, but
it was in an almost well-pleased tone that she said, &lsquo;Dear
mamma, I always knew she felt it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! little did we think how deeply went the stroke that
showed no wound!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; She felt that she was going to him.&nbsp; We
could never have made her happy here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are content, my unselfish one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about myself, please!&rsquo;
implored Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have too much to do for
that.&nbsp; What did he say?&nbsp; That the others should be
written to?&nbsp; I will take my case and write in mamma&rsquo;s
room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediate duty was her refuge from anticipation, gentle
tendance from the sense of misery, and, though her mother&rsquo;s
restless feebleness needed constant waiting on, her four notes
were completed before post-time.&nbsp; Augusta was eating red
mullet in Guernsey, Juliana was on a round of visits in Scotland,
Mervyn was supposed to be in Paris, Robert alone was near at
hand.</p>
<p>At night Ph&oelig;be sent Boodle to bed; but Miss Fennimore
insisted on sharing her pupil&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp; At first there
was nothing to do; the patient had fallen into a heavy slumber,
and the daughter sat by the bed, the governess at the window,
unoccupied save by their books.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be was reading
Miss Maurice&rsquo;s invaluable counsels to the nurses of the
dying.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore had the Bible.&nbsp; It was not from
a sense of appropriateness, as in pursuance of her system of
re-examination.&nbsp; Always admiring the Scripture in a
patronizing temper, she had gloried in critical inquiry, and
regarded plenary inspiration as a superstition, covering weak
points by pretensions to infallibility.&nbsp; But since her
discussions with Robert, and her readings of Butler with Bertha,
she had begun to weigh for herself the internal, intrinsic
evidence of Divine origin, above all, in the Gospels, which, to
her surprise, enchained her attention and investigation, as she
would have thought beyond the power of such simple words.</p>
<p><!-- page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>Pilate&rsquo;s question, &lsquo;What is truth?&rsquo;
was before her.&nbsp; To her it was a link of evidence.&nbsp;
Without even granting that the writer was the fisherman he
professed to be, what, short of Shakesperian intuition, could
thus have depicted the Roman of the early Empire in equal dread
of C&aelig;sar and of the populace, at once unscrupulous and
timid, contemning Jewish prejudice, yet, with lingering
mythological superstition, trembling at the hint of a present
Deity in human form; and, lost in the bewilderment of the later
Greek philosophy, greeting the word <i>truth</i> with the
startled inquiry, what it might be.&nbsp; What <i>is</i>
truth?&nbsp; It had been the question of Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s
life, and she felt a blank and a disappointment as it stood
unanswered.&nbsp; A movement made her look up.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be
was raising her mother, and Miss Fennimore was needed to support
the pillows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, my dear, are you here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear mamma, I always am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, my dear, I think I am soon going.&nbsp;
You have been a good child, my dear; I wish I had done more for
you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear mamma, you have always been so kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They didn&rsquo;t teach me like Honora
Charlecote,&rsquo; she faltered on; &lsquo;but I always did as
your poor papa told me.&nbsp; Nobody ever told me how to be
religious, and your poor papa would not have liked it.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, you know more than I do.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think
God will be hard with me, do you?&nbsp; I am such a poor
creature; but there is the Blood that takes away sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear mother, that is the blessed trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>Truth</i>,&rsquo; flashed upon Miss Fennimore,
as she watched their faces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will He give me His own goodness?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Fulmort, wistfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never did know how to think
about Him&mdash;I wish I had cared more.&nbsp; What do you think,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell how to answer fully, dear mamma,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but indeed it is safe to think of His
great loving-kindness and mercy.&nbsp; Robert will be here
to-morrow.&nbsp; He will tell you better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will give me the Holy Sacrament,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Fulmort, &lsquo;and then I shall go&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently she moved uneasily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Ph&oelig;be, I
am so tired.&nbsp; Nothing rests me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There remaineth a rest,&rsquo; gently whispered
Ph&oelig;be&mdash;and Miss Fennimore thought the young face had
something of the angel in it&mdash;&lsquo;no more weariness
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t think what a poor dull thing I am
there,&rsquo; added her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I could take
poor Maria with me.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t like her here, and she
will be teased and put about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, mother, never while I can take care of
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you will, Ph&oelig;be, if you say so.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be, love, when I see God, I shall thank Him for having
made you so good and dear, and letting me have some comfort in
one of my children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to make her think of Robert, but she was
exhausted, dozed, and was never able to speak so much again.</p>
<p><!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>Miss Fennimore thought instead of reading.&nbsp; Was it
the mere effect on her sympathies that bore in on her mind that
Truth existed, and was grasped by the mother and daughter?&nbsp;
What was there in those faltering accents that impressed her with
reality?&nbsp; Why, of all her many instructors, had none touched
her like poor, ignorant, feeble-minded Mrs. Fulmort?</p>
<p>Robert arrived the next day.&nbsp; His mother knew him and was
roused sufficiently to accept his offices as a clergyman.&nbsp;
Then, as if she thought it was expected of her, she asked for her
younger daughters, but when they came, she looked distressed and
perplexed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless them, mother,&rsquo; said Robert, bending over
her, and she evidently accepted this as what she wanted; but
&lsquo;How&mdash;what?&rsquo; she added; and taking the uncertain
hand, he guided it to the head of each of his three sisters, and
prompted the words of blessing from the failing tongue.&nbsp;
Then as Bertha rose, he sank on his knees in her place,
&lsquo;Bless me, bless me, too, mother; bless me, and pardon my
many acts of self-will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are good&mdash;you&mdash;you are a
clergyman,&rsquo; she hesitated, bewildered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more reason, mamma; it will comfort
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it was Ph&oelig;be who won for her brother
the blessing needed as balm to a bleeding heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The others are away,&rsquo; said the dying woman;
&lsquo;maybe, if I had made them good when they were little, they
would not have left me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While striving to join in prayer for them, she slumbered, and
in the course of the night she slept herself tranquilly away from
the world where even prosperity had been but a troubled maze to
her.</p>
<p>Augusta arrived, weeping profusely, but with all her wits
about her, so as to assume the command, and to provide for her
own, and her Admiral&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be was left
to the mournful repose of having no one to whom to attend, since
Miss Fennimore provided for the younger ones; and in the
lassitude of bodily fatigue and sorrow, she shrank from
Maria&rsquo;s babyish questions and Bertha&rsquo;s levity and
curiosity, spending her time chiefly alone.&nbsp; Even Robert
could not often be with her, since Mervyn&rsquo;s absence and
silence threw much on him and Mr. Crabbe, the executor and
guardian; and the Bannermans were both exacting and
self-important.&nbsp; The Actons, having been pursued by their
letters from place to place in the Highlands, at length arrived,
and Mervyn last of all, only just in time for the funeral.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be did not see him till the evening after it, when,
having spent the day nearly alone, she descended to the late
dinner, and after the quietness in which she had lately lived,
and with all the tenderness from fresh suffering, it seemed to
her that she was entering on a distracting turmoil of
voices.&nbsp; Mervyn, however, came forward at once to meet her,
threw his arm <!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 356</span>round her, and kissed her rather
demonstratively, saying, &lsquo;My little Ph&oelig;be, I wondered
where you were;&rsquo; then putting her into a chair, and bending
over her, &lsquo;We are in for the funeral games.&nbsp; Stand up
for yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not know in the least what he could mean, but she was
too sick at heart to ask; she only thought he looked unwell,
jaded, and fagged, and with a heated complexion.</p>
<p>He handed Lady Acton into the dining-room; Augusta, following
with Sir Bevil, was going to the head of the table, when he
called out, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not before my elders,&rsquo; Ph&oelig;be answered,
trying to seat herself at the side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sister at home is mistress of the house,&rsquo; he
sternly answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take your proper place,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In much discomfort she obeyed, and tried to attend civilly to
Sir Nicholas&rsquo;s observations on the viands, hoping to
intercept a few, as she perceived how they chafed her eldest
brother.</p>
<p>At last, on Mervyn himself roundly abusing the flavour of the
ice-pudding, Augusta not only defended it, but confessed to
having herself directed Mrs. Brisbane to the concoction that
morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Brisbane shall take orders from no lady but Miss
Fulmort, while she is in my house,&rsquo; thundered Mervyn.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, in agony, began to say she knew not what to Sir
Bevil, and he seconded her with equal vehemence and incoherency,
till by the time they knew what they were talking of, they were
with much interest discussing his little daughter, scarcely
turning their heads from one another, till, in the midst of
dessert, the voice of Juliana was heard,&mdash;&lsquo;Sir Bevil,
Sir Bevil, if you can spare me any attention&mdash;What was the
name of that person at Hampstead that your sister told me
of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That person!&nbsp; What, where poor Anne Acton was
boarded?&nbsp; Dr. Graham, he called himself, but I don&rsquo;t
believe he was a physician.&nbsp; Horrid vulgar
fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellent for the purpose, though,&rsquo; continued
Lady Acton, addressing herself as before to Mr. Crabbe;
&lsquo;advertises for nervous or deficient ladies, and boards
them on very fair terms: would take her quite off our
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be turned a wild look of imploring interrogation on
Sir Bevil, but a certain family telegraph had electrified him,
and his eyes were on the grapes that he was eating with nervous
haste.&nbsp; Her blood boiling at what she apprehended,
Ph&oelig;be could endure her present post no longer, and starting
up, made the signal for leaving the dinner-table so suddenly that
Augusta choked upon her glass of wine, and carried off her last
macaroon in her hand.&nbsp; Before she had recovered breath to
rebuke her sister&rsquo;s precipitation, Ph&oelig;be, with
boldness and spirit quite new to the sisters, was confronting
Juliana, and demanding what she had been saying about
Hampstead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only,&rsquo; said Juliana, coolly, &lsquo;that I have
found a capital place <!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 357</span>there for Maria&mdash;a Dr. Graham,
who boards and lodges such unfortunates.&nbsp; Sir Bevil had an
idiot cousin there who died.&nbsp; I shall write
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promised that Maria should not be separated from
me,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, my dear,&rsquo; said Augusta; &lsquo;we could
not receive her; she can never be made presentable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear; did you not know?&nbsp; You go home with
us the day after to-morrow; and next spring I mean to bring you
out, and take you everywhere.&nbsp; The Admiral is so
generous!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the others?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind undertaking Bertha,&rsquo; said Lady
Acton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know of a good school for her, and I shall
deposit Maria at Dr. Graham&rsquo;s as soon as I can get an
answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; continued Augusta, &lsquo;Ph&oelig;be
will look very creditable by and by, when she has more colour and
not all this crape.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall get her married by the
end of the season; only you must learn better manners first,
Ph&oelig;be&mdash;not to rush out of the dining-room in this
way.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do without my other
glass of wine&mdash;when I am so low, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fine mistress of the house, indeed,&rsquo; said Lady
Acton.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is well Mervyn&rsquo;s absurd notion is
impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was that?&nbsp; To keep us all?&rsquo; asked
Ph&oelig;be, catching at the hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Maria nor the governess.&nbsp; You need not flatter
yourself,&rsquo; said Juliana; &lsquo;he said he wouldn&rsquo;t
have them at any price; and as to keeping house alone with a man
of his character, even you may have sense to see it
couldn&rsquo;t be for a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did Robert consent to Maria&rsquo;s going to
Hampstead?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert&mdash;what has he to do with it?&nbsp; He has no
voice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said something about getting the three boarded with
some clergyman&rsquo;s widow,&rsquo; said Augusta; &lsquo;buried
in some hole, I suppose, to make them like himself&mdash;go to
church every day, and eat cold dinners on Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to see Bertha doing that,&rsquo; said
Juliana, laughing.</p>
<p>But the agony of helplessness that had oppressed Ph&oelig;be
was relieved.&nbsp; She saw an outlet, and could form a
resolution.&nbsp; Home might have to be given up, but there was a
means of fulfilling her mother&rsquo;s charge, and saving Maria
from the private idiot asylum; and for that object Ph&oelig;be
was ready to embrace perpetual seclusion with the dullest of
widows.&nbsp; She found her sisters discussing their favourite
subject&mdash;Mervyn&rsquo;s misconduct and
extravagance&mdash;and she was able to sit apart, working, and
thinking of her line of action.&nbsp; Only two days!&nbsp; She
must be prompt, and not wait for privacy or for counsel.&nbsp; So
when the gentlemen came in, and Mr. Crabbe came towards her, she
took him into the window, and asked him if any choice were
permitted her as to her residence.</p>
<p><!-- page 358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
358</span>&lsquo;Certainly; so nearly of age as you are.&nbsp;
But I naturally considered that you would wish to be with Lady
Bannerman, with all the advantages of London society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she will not receive Maria.&nbsp; I promised that
Maria should be my charge.&nbsp; You have not consented to this
Hampstead scheme?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her ladyship is precipitate,&rsquo; half whispered the
lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I certainly would not, till I had seen the
establishment, and judged for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nor then,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come to-morrow, and see her.&nbsp; She is no subject for
<i>an establishment</i>.&nbsp; And I beg you will let me be with
her; I would much prefer being with any lady who would receive us
both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very amiable,&rsquo; said Mr. Crabbe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; interrupted Mervyn, &lsquo;you are not
afraid I shall let Augusta carry you off, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; She
would give the world to get you, but I don&rsquo;t mean to part
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of no use to talk to her, Mervyn,&rsquo; cried
Augusta&rsquo;s loud voice from the other end of the room.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She knows that she cannot remain with you.&nbsp; Robert
himself would tell her so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert knows better than to interfere,&rsquo; said
Mervyn, with one of his scowls.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now then,
Ph&oelig;be, settle it for yourself.&nbsp; Will you stay and keep
house for me at home, or be Augusta&rsquo;s companion?&nbsp;
There! the choice of Hercules.&nbsp; Virtue or vice?&rsquo; he
added, trying to laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, readily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My home is fixed by Maria&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, are you crazy?&rsquo; broke out the three
voices; while Sir Nicholas slowly and sententiously explained
that he regretted the unfortunate circumstance, but Maria&rsquo;s
peculiarities made it impossible to produce her in society; and
that when her welfare and happiness had been consulted by
retirement, Ph&oelig;be would find a home in his house, and be
treated as Lady Bannerman&rsquo;s sister, and a young lady of her
expectations, deserved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; then turning to her
brother, &lsquo;Mervyn, do you, too, cast off poor
Maria?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you what I thought of that long ago,&rsquo; said
Mervyn, carelessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, sadly;
&lsquo;perhaps you will let us stay till some lady can be found
of whom Mr. Crabbe may approve, with whom Maria and I can
live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Acton!&rsquo; Sir Bevil&rsquo;s voice was low and
entreating, but all heard it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not going to encumber myself,&rsquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I always disliked girls, and I shall
certainly not make Acton Manor an idiot asylum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And mind,&rsquo; added Augusta, &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t
cone to me for the season!&nbsp; I have no notion of your leaving
me all the dull part of the year for some gay widow at a
watering-place, and then expecting me to go out with you in
London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Heaven!&rsquo; broke out Mervyn, &lsquo;they
<i>shall</i> stay here, if <!-- page 359--><a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>only to
balk your spite.&nbsp; My sisters shall not be driven from pillar
to post the very day their mother is put under ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some respectable lady,&rsquo; began Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some horrid old harridan of a boarding-house
keeper,&rsquo; shouted Mervyn, the louder for his
interference.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, you would like it, and spend all
their fortunes on parsons in long coats!&nbsp; I know
better!&nbsp; Come here, Ph&oelig;be, and listen.&nbsp; You shall
live here as you have always done, Maria and all, and keep the
Fennimore woman to mind the children.&nbsp; Answer me, will that
content you?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go looking at Robert, but say yes
or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn&rsquo;s innuendo had deprived his offer of its grace,
but in spite of the pang of indignation, in spite of
Robert&rsquo;s eye of disapproval, poor desolate Ph&oelig;be must
needs cling to her home, and to the one who alone would take her
and her poor companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mervyn, thank you; it is
right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right!&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; If any one has
a word to say against my sisters being under my roof, let me hear
it openly, not behind my back.&nbsp; Eh, Juliana, what&rsquo;s
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only that I wonder how long it will last,&rsquo;
sneered Lady Acton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; added Robert, &lsquo;there should be some
guarantee that they should not be introduced to unsuitable
acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think me not to be trusted with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn ground his teeth, answering, &lsquo;Very well, sir, I
stand indebted to you.&nbsp; I should have imagined, whatever
your opinion of me, you would have considered your favourite
sky-blue governess an immaculate guardian, or can you be
contented with nothing short of a sisterhood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, fearing lest worse
should follow, &lsquo;Mervyn has always been good to us; I trust
to him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And her clear eyes were turned on the eldest
brother with a grateful confidence that made him catch her hand
with something between thanks and triumph, as he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said, little one!&nbsp; There, sir, are you
satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must be,&rsquo; replied Robert.</p>
<p>Sir Bevil, able to endure no longer, broke in with some
intelligence from the newspaper, which he had been perusing ever
since his unlucky appeal to his lady.&nbsp; Every one thankfully
accepted this means of ending the discussion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Miss,&rsquo; was Juliana&rsquo;s good night,
&lsquo;you have attained your object.&nbsp; I hope you may find
it answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; added Augusta, &lsquo;when Mervyn brings
home that Frenchwoman, you will wish you had been less
tenacious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all an idea of yours,&rsquo; said
Juliana.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll have punishment enough in
Master Mervyn&rsquo;s own temper.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t keep
house for him, no, not for a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay till you are asked,&rsquo; said Augusta.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could bear no more, but slipped through the
swing-door, reached her room, and sinking into a chair, passively
let Lieschen undress her, not attempting to raise her drooping
<!-- page 360--><a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>head, nor check the tears that trickled, conscious only
of her broken, wounded, oppressed state of dejection, into the
details of which she durst not look.&nbsp; How could she, when
her misery had been inflicted by such hands?&nbsp; The mere fact
of the unseemly broil between the brothers and sisters on such an
evening was shame and pain enough, and she felt like one bruised
and crushed all over, both in herself and Maria, while the one
drop of comfort in Mervyn&rsquo;s kindness was poisoned by the
strife between him and Robert, and the doubt whether Robert
thought she ought to have accepted it.</p>
<p>When her maid left her, she only moved to extinguish her
light, and then cowered down again as if to hide in the darkness;
but the soft summer twilight gloom seemed to soothe and restore
her, and with a longing for air to refresh her throbbing brow,
she leant out into the cool, still night, looking into the
northern sky, still pearly with the last reminiscence of the late
sunset, and with the pale large stars beaming calmly down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh mother, mother!&nbsp; Well might you long to take
your poor Maria with you&mdash;there where the weary are at
rest&mdash;where there is mercy for the weak and slow!&nbsp;
Home! home! we have none but with you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nay, had she not a home with Him whose love was more than
mother&rsquo;s love; whose soft stars were smiling on her now;
whose gentle breezes fanned her burning cheeks, even as a still
softer breath of comfort was stilling her troubled spirit!&nbsp;
She leant out till she could compose herself to kneel in prayer,
and from prayer rose up quietly, weary, and able to rest beneath
the Fatherly Wings spread over the orphan.</p>
<p>She was early astir, though with heavy, swollen eyelids; and
anxious to avoid Bertha&rsquo;s inquiries till all should be more
fully settled, she betook herself to the garden, to cool her brow
and eyes.&nbsp; She was bathing them in the dewy fragrant heart
of a full-blown rose, that had seemed to look at her with a
tearful smile of sympathy, when a step approached, and an arm was
thrown round her, and Robert stood beside her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said tenderly, &lsquo;how are
you?&nbsp; It was a frightful evening!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Robert, were you displeased with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed.&nbsp; You put us all to shame.&nbsp; I
grieved that you had no more preparation, but some of the guests
stayed late, afterwards I was hindered by business, and then
Bevil laid hands on me to advise me privately against this
establishment for poor Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it was Juliana who pressed it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you not learnt that whatever he dislikes she
forwards?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Robert, you can hinder that scheme from ever being
thought of again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Robert; &lsquo;<i>there</i> she should
never have been, even had you not made resistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Robert, may we stay here?&rsquo; asked
Ph&oelig;be, trembling.</p>
<p><!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>&lsquo;Crabbe sees no objection,&rsquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you, Robert?&nbsp; If you think we ought not, I will
try to change; but Mervyn is kind, and it <i>is</i> home!&nbsp; I
saw you thought me wrong, but I could not help being glad he
relented to Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were right.&nbsp; Your eldest brother is the right
person to give you a home.&nbsp; I cannot.&nbsp; It would have
shown an evil, suspicious temper if you had refused
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet you do not like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I am unjust.&nbsp; I own that I had imagined
you all happier and better in such a home as Mrs. Parsons or Miss
Charlecote could find for you; and though Mervyn would scarcely
wilfully take advantage of your innocence, I do not trust to his
always knowing what would be hurtful to you or Bertha.&nbsp; It
is a charge that I grudge to him, for I do not think he perceives
what it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could make you think better of him.&nbsp; I wonder
whether I may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything&mdash;anything to make me think better of
him,&rsquo; cried Robert eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know it from him alone, so it cannot be a
breach of confidence,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
has been deeply attached, not to a pretty person, nor a rich nor
grand one, but she was very good and religious&mdash;so much so
that she would not accept him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How recently?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The attachment has been long; the rejection this
spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor Ph&oelig;be, I could not tell you how his time
has been passed since early spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know in part,&rsquo; she said, looking down;
&lsquo;but, Robin, <i>that</i> arose from despair.&nbsp; Oh, how
I longed for him to come and let me try to comfort
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how is this to change my opinion,&rsquo; asked
Robert, &lsquo;except by showing me that no right-minded woman
could trust herself with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Robert, no!&nbsp; Sisters need not change, though
others ought, perhaps.&nbsp; I meant you to see that he does love
and honour goodness for itself, and so that he will guard his
sisters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will think so, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; You deserve to be
believed, for you draw out his best points.&nbsp; For my own
part, the miserable habits of our boyhood have left a habit of
acrimony, of which, repent as I will, I cannot free myself.&nbsp;
I gave way to it last night.&nbsp; I can be cool, but I cannot
help being contemptuous.&nbsp; I make him worse, and I aggravated
your difficulties by insulting him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He insulted you,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When I think of those words I don&rsquo;t know how I can
stay with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They fell short!&nbsp; They were nothing,&rsquo; said
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it was the more unbefitting in me to
frame my warning as I did.&nbsp; Oh, Ph&oelig;be, your prayers
and influence have done much for me.&nbsp; Help me now to treat
my brother so as not to disgrace my calling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;when you freely forgive all the injuries he
has done you!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>&lsquo;If I freely forgave, I suppose I should
love;&rsquo; and he murmured sadly, &lsquo;He that hateth his
brother is a murderer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be shrank, but could not help thinking that if the
spirit of Cain existed among them, it was not with the younger
brother.</p>
<p>When she next spoke, it was to express her fear lest Miss
Fennimore should refuse to remain, since the position would be
uncomfortable.&nbsp; Her talent was thrown away on poor Maria,
and Bertha had been very vexing and provoking of late.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be greatly dreaded a change, both from her love for her
governess, and alarm lest a new duenna might be yet more
unwelcome to Mervyn, and she was disappointed to see that Robert
caught at the hope that the whole scheme might be baffled on this
score.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be thought a repetition of the dinner-table offence
would be best obviated by taking her place as tea-maker at
once.&nbsp; Mervyn first came down, and greeted her like
something especially his own.&nbsp; He detected the red blistered
spot on her cheek, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Eh! did they make you
cry?&nbsp; Never mind; the house will soon be clear of them, and
you my little queen.&nbsp; You have nothing to say against
it.&nbsp; Has any one been putting things in your head?&rsquo;
and he looked fiercely at his brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Mervyn; Robert and I both think you very kind, and
that it is the right thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;no arrangement could be
more proper.&nbsp; I am sorry, Mervyn, if my manner was offensive
last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never take offence, it is not my way,&rsquo; said
Mervyn, indifferently, almost annoyed that his brother had not
spirit to persevere in the quarrel.</p>
<p>After the breakfast, where the elder sisters were cold and
distant, and Sir Bevil as friendly as he durst, Mervyn&rsquo;s
first move was to go, in conjunction with Mr. Crabbe, to explain
the arrangement to Miss Fennimore, and request her to continue
her services.&nbsp; They came away surprised and angry: Miss
Fennimore would &lsquo;consider of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even when
Mervyn, to spare himself from &lsquo;some stranger who might
prove a greater nuisance,&rsquo; had offered a hundred in
addition to her present exorbitant salary, she courteously
declined, and repeated that her reply should be given in the
evening.</p>
<p>Mervyn&rsquo;s wrath would have been doubled had he known the
cause of her delay.&nbsp; She sent Maria to beg Robert to spare
her half an hour, and on his entrance, dismissing her pupils, she
said, &lsquo;Mr. Fulmort, I should be glad if you would candidly
tell me your opinion of the proposed arrangement.&nbsp; I
mean,&rsquo; seeing his hesitation, &lsquo;of that part which
relates to myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not quite understand you,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean, whether, as the person whose decision has the
most worth in this family, you are satisfied to leave your
sisters under my charge?&nbsp; If not, whatever it may cost me to
part with that sweet and admirable Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; and her
voice showed unwonted emotion, &lsquo;I would not think of
remaining with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You put me in a very strange position, Miss Fennimore;
I <!-- page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>have no authority to decide.&nbsp; They could have no
friend more sincerely anxious for their welfare or so welcome to
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s present wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not; but the question is not of my feelings nor
theirs, but whether you consider my influence pernicious to their
religious principles.&nbsp; If so, I decline their
guardian&rsquo;s terms at once.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a pause, she
added, pleased at his deliberation, &lsquo;It may assist you if I
lay before you the state of my own mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She proceeded to explain that her parents had been professed
Unitarians, her mother, loving and devout to the hereditary
faith, beyond which she had never looked&mdash;&lsquo;Mr.
Fulmort,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;nothing will approve itself to
me that condemns my mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He began to say that often where there was no wilful rejection
of truth, saving grace and faith might be vouchsafed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are charitable,&rsquo; she answered, in a tone like
sarcasm, and went on.&nbsp; Her father, a literary man of high
ability, set aside from work by ill-health, thought himself above
creeds.&nbsp; He had given his daughter a man&rsquo;s education,
had read many argumentative books with her, and died, leaving her
liberally and devoutly inclined in the spirit of Pope&rsquo;s
universal prayer&mdash;&lsquo;Jehovah, Jove, or
Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was all aspiration to the Lord of nature,
the forms, adaptations to humanity, kaleidoscope shapes of
half-comprehended fragments, each with its own beauty, and only
becoming worthy of reprobation where they permitted moral vices,
among which she counted intolerance.</p>
<p>What she thought reasonable&mdash;Christianity, modified by
the world&rsquo;s progress&mdash;was her tenet, and she had no
scruple in partaking in any act of worship; while naturally
conscientious, and loving all the virtues, she viewed the terrors
of religion as the scourge of the grovelling and superstitious;
or if suffering existed at all, it could be only as expiation,
conducting to a condition of high intellect and perfect
morality.&nbsp; No other view, least of all that of a vicarious
atonement, seemed to her worthy of the beneficence of the God
whom she had set up for herself.</p>
<p>Thus had she rested for twenty years; but of late she had been
dissatisfied.&nbsp; Living with Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;though the
child was not naturally intellectual,&rsquo; there was no
avoiding the impression that what she acted and rested on was
substantial truth.&nbsp; &lsquo;The same with others,&rsquo; said
Miss Fennimore, meaning her auditor himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;And,
again, I cannot but feel that devotion to any system of faith is
the restraint that Bertha is deficient in, and that this is
probably owing to my own tone.&nbsp; These examples have led me
to go over the former ground in the course of the present spring;
and it has struck me that, if the Divine Being be not the mere
abstraction I once supposed, it is consistent to believe that He
has a character and will&mdash;individuality, in short&mdash;so
that there might be one single revelation of absolute
truth.&nbsp; I have not thoroughly gone through the subject, but
I hope to <!-- page 364--><a name="page364"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 364</span>do so; and when I mark what I can
only call a supernatural influence on an individual character, I
view it as an evidence in favour of the system that produced
it.&nbsp; My exposition of my opinions shocks you; I knew it
would.&nbsp; But knowing this, and thinking it possible that an
undoubting believer might have influenced Bertha, are you willing
to trust your sisters to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me ask one question&mdash;why was this explanation
never offered before to those who had more right to
decide?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My tenets have seldom been the subject of
inquiry.&nbsp; When they have, I have concealed nothing; and
twice have thus missed a situation.&nbsp; But these things are
usually taken for granted; and I never imagined it my duty to
volunteer my religious sentiments, since I never obtruded
them.&nbsp; I gave no scandal by objecting to any form of
worship, and concerned myself with the moral and intellectual,
not the religious being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you reach the moral without the
religious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should tell you that I have seldom reared a pupil
from childhood.&nbsp; Mine have been chiefly from fifteen to
eighteen, whose parents required their instruction, not
education, from me; and till I came here, I never fully beheld
the growth and development of character.&nbsp; I found that
whereas all I could do for Ph&oelig;be was to give her method and
information, leaving alone the higher graces elsewhere derived,
with Bertha, my efforts were inadequate to supply any motive for
overcoming her natural defects; and I believe that association
with a person of my sceptical habit has tended to prevent
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s religion from influencing her
sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the reason you tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly; and likewise because I esteem you very
differently from my former employers, and know that your views
for your sisters are not like those of the persons with whom I
have been accustomed to deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know that I have no power.&nbsp; It rests entirely
with my brother and Mr. Crabbe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am perfectly aware of it; but I could not allow
myself to be forced on your sisters by any family arrangement
contrary to the wishes of that member of it who is most qualified
to judge for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Miss Fennimore; I will treat you as openly
as you have treated me.&nbsp; I have often felt indignant that my
sisters should be exposed to any risk of having their faith
shaken; and this morning I almost hoped to hear that you did not
consent to Mervyn&rsquo;s scheme.&nbsp; But what you have said
convinces me that, whatever you may have been previously, you are
more likely to strengthen and confirm them in all that is good
than half the people they would meet.&nbsp; I know that it would
be a heavy affliction to Ph&oelig;be to lose so kind a friend; it
might drive her from the home to which she clings, and separate
Bertha, at least, from her; and under the circumstances, I cannot
wish you to leave the poor girls at present.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
spoke <!-- page 365--><a name="page365"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 365</span>rather confusedly, but there was
more consent in manner than words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she replied, fervently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I cannot tell you what it would cost me to part with
Ph&oelig;be, my living lesson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only let the lesson be still unconscious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not have it otherwise for worlds.&nbsp; The
calm reliance that makes her a ministering spirit is far too
lovely to be ruffled by a hint of the controversies that weary my
brain.&nbsp; If it be effect of credulity, the effects are more
beauteous than those of clear eyesight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not always think it credulity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There would be great rest in being able to accept all
that you and she do,&rsquo; Miss Fennimore answered with a sigh;
&lsquo;in finding an unchanging answer to &ldquo;What is
truth?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet even your Gospel leaves that question
unanswered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unanswered to Pilate; but those who are true find the
truth; I verily trust that your eyes will become cleared to find
it.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore, you know that I am unready and weak in
argument, and you have often left me no refuge but my positive
conviction; but I can refer you to those who are strong.&nbsp; If
I can help you by carrying your difficulties to others, or by
pointing out books, I should rejoice&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot argue&mdash;you can only act,&rsquo; said
Miss Fennimore, smiling, as a message called him away.</p>
<p>The schoolroom had been left undisturbed, for the sisters were
otherwise occupied.&nbsp; By Mr. Fulmort&rsquo;s will, the
jewels, excepting certain Mervyn heirlooms, were to be divided
between the daughters, and their two ladyships thought this the
best time for their choice, though as yet they could not take
possession.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be would have given the world that the
sets had been appropriated, so that Mervyn and Mr. Crabbe should
not have had to make her miserable by fighting her battles,
insisting on her choosing, and then overruling her choice as not
of sufficiently valuable articles, while Bertha profited by the
lesson in harpy-hood, and regarded all claimed by the others as
so much taken from herself; and poor Maria clasped on every
bracelet one by one, threaded every ring on her fingers, and
caught the same lustre on every diamond, delighting in the grand
exhibition, and in her own share, which by general consent
included all that was clumsy and ill-set.&nbsp; No one had the
heart to disturb her, but Ph&oelig;be felt that the poor thing
was an eyesore to them all, and was hardly able to endure
Augusta&rsquo;s compliment, &lsquo;After all, Ph&oelig;be, she is
not so bad; you may make her tolerably presentable for the
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Acton patronized Bertha, in opposition to Ph&oelig;be;
and Sir Bevil was glad to have one sister to whom he could be
good-natured without molestation.&nbsp; The young lady, heartily
weary of the monotony of home, was much disappointed at the
present arrangement; Ph&oelig;be had become the envied elder
sister instead of the companion in misfortune, and Juliana was
looked on as <!-- page 366--><a name="page366"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 366</span>the sympathizing friend who would
fain have opened the prison doors that Ph&oelig;be closed against
her by making all that disturbance about Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all humbug about Maria,&rsquo; said
Juliana.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much Ph&oelig;be will let her stand in her
way when she wants to come to London for the season&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ll not take her out, I promise her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will take me,&rsquo; cried Bertha.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not leave me in this dismal hole
always.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear, Bertha.&nbsp; This plan won&rsquo;t last
six months.&nbsp; Mervyn and Ph&oelig;be will get sick of one
another, and Augusta will be ready to take her in&mdash;she is
pining for an errand girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not go there to read cookery books and meet
old fogies.&nbsp; You will have me, Juliana, and we will have
such fun together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you are come out, perhaps&mdash;and you must cure
that stammer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall die of dulness before then!&nbsp; If I could
only go to school!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be you with Maria for your most lively
companion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is much worse than when we used to go down into the
drawing-room.&nbsp; Now we never see any one but Miss Charlecote,
and Ph&oelig;be is getting exactly like her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, all her sanctimonious ways?&nbsp; I thought
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to make it more aggravating, Miss Fennimore is
going to get religious too.&nbsp; She made me read all
Butler&rsquo;s <i>Analogy</i>, and wants to put me into
<i>Paley</i>, and she is always running after Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Middle-aged governesses always do run after young
clergymen&mdash;especially the most
<i>outr&eacute;&rsquo;s</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now she snaps me up if I say anything the least
comprehensive or speculative, or if I laugh at the
conventionalities Ph&oelig;be learns at the Holt.&nbsp; Yesterday
I said that the progress of common sense would soon make people
cease to connect dulness with mortality, or to think a serious
mistiness the sole evidence of respect, and I was caught up as if
it were high treason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not get out of bounds in your talk, Bertha, or
sound unfeeling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help being original,&rsquo; said
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must evolve my ideas out of my individual
consciousness, and assert my independence of thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Juliana laughed, not quite following her sister&rsquo;s
metaphysical tone, but satisfied that it was anti-Ph&oelig;be,
she answered by observing, &lsquo;An intolerable fuss they do
make about that girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she is not a bit clever,&rsquo; continued
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can do a translation in half the time she
takes, and have got far beyond her in all kinds of natural
philosophy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She flatters Mervyn, that&rsquo;s the thing; but she
will soon have enough of that.&nbsp; I hope he won&rsquo;t get
her into some dreadful scrape, that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What sort of scrape?&rsquo; asked Bertha, gathering
from the smack of the hope that it was something exciting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you are too much of a chit to know&mdash;but I say,
Bertha, <!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 367</span>write to me, and let me know whom
Mervyn brings to the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With somewhat the like injunction, only directed to a
different quarter, Robert likewise left Beauchamp.</p>
<p>As he well knew would be the case, nothing in his own
circumstances was changed by his mother&rsquo;s death, save that
he no longer could call her inheritance his home.&nbsp; She had
made no will, and her entire estate passed to her eldest son,
from whom Robert parted on terms of defiance, rather understood
than expressed.&nbsp; He took leave of his birthplace as one
never expecting to return thither, and going for his last hour at
Hiltonbury to Miss Charlecote, poured out to her as many of his
troubles as he could bear to utter.&nbsp; &lsquo;And,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;I have given my approval to the two schemes that I
most disapproved beforehand&mdash;to Mervyn&rsquo;s giving my
sisters a home, and to Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s continuing their
governess!&nbsp; What will come of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not repent, Robert,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Depend upon it, the great danger is in rashly meddling
with existing arrangements, especially by a strain of
influence.&nbsp; It is what the young are slow to learn, but
experience brings it home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With you to watch them, I will fear the
less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote wondered whether any disappointment of his own
added to his depression, and if he thought of Lucilla.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<blockquote><p>My sister is not so defenceless left<br />
As you imagine.&nbsp; She has a hidden strength<br />
Which you remember not.&mdash;<i>Comus</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was left to the vacancy of the orphaned house, to
a blank where her presence had been gladness, and to relief more
sad than pain, in parting with her favourite brother, and seeing
him out of danger of provoking or being provoked.</p>
<p>To have been the cause of strife and object of envy weighed
like guilt on her heart, and the tempest that had tossed her when
most needing peace and soothing, left her sore and
suffering.&nbsp; She did not nurse her grief, and was content
that her mother should be freed from the burthen of existence
that had of late been so heavy; but the missing the cherished
recipient of her care was inevitable, and she was not of a nature
to shake off dejection readily, nor to throw sorrow aside in
excitement.</p>
<p>Mervyn felt as though he had caught a lark, and found it droop
instead of singing.&nbsp; He was very kind, almost oppressively
so; he rode or drove with her to every ruin or view esteemed
worth seeing, ordered books for her, and consulted her on
improvements that pained her by the very fact of change.&nbsp;
She gave her attention sweetly and gratefully, was always at his
call, and amused his evenings with cards or music, but she felt
herself dull and sad, and saw him disappointed in her.</p>
<p><!-- page 368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>Then she tried bringing in Bertha as entertainment for
both, but it was a downright failure.&nbsp; Bertha was far too
sharp and pert for an elder brother devoid both of wit and
temper, and the only consequence was that she fathomed his
shallow acquirements in literature and the natural sciences, and
he pronounced her to be eaten up with conceit, and the most
intolerable child he ever saw&mdash;an irremediable insult to a
young woman of fifteen; nor could Bertha be brought forward
without disappointing Maria, whose presence Mervyn would not
endure, and thus Ph&oelig;be was forced to yield the point, and
keep in the background the appendages only tolerated for her
sake.</p>
<p>Greatly commiserating Bertha&rsquo;s weariness of the
schoolroom, she tried to gratify the governess and please her
sisters by resuming her studies; but the motive of duty and
obedience being gone, these were irksome to a mind naturally
meditative and practical, and she found herself triumphed over by
Bertha for forgetting whether Lucca were Guelf or Ghibelline,
putting oolite below red sandstone, or confusing the definition
of ozone.&nbsp; She liked Bertha to surpass her; but inattention
she regarded as wrong in itself, as well as a bad example, and
her apologies were so hearty as quite to affect Miss
Fennimore.</p>
<p>Mervyn&rsquo;s attentions wore off with the days of
seclusion.&nbsp; By the third week he was dining out, by the
fourth he was starting for Goodwood, half inviting Ph&oelig;be to
come with him, and assuring her that it was just what she wanted
to put her into spirits again.&nbsp; Poor Ph&oelig;be&mdash;when
Mr. Henderson talking to Miss Fennimore, and Bertha at the same
time insisting on Decandolle&rsquo;s system to Miss Charlecote,
had seemed to create a distressing whirl and confusion!</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore smiled, both with pleasure and amusement, as
Ph&oelig;be asked her permission to walk to the Holt, and be
fetched home by the carriage at night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am so glad to have some one&rsquo;s leave to
ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not laugh, my dear, but I will not help you to
reverse our positions.&nbsp; It is better we should both be
accustomed to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems selfish to take the carriage for
myself,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but I think I have rather
neglected Miss Charlecote for Mervyn, and I believe she would
like to have me alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The solitude of the walk was a great boon, and there was
healing in the power of silence&mdash;the repose of not being
forced to be lively.&nbsp; Summer flowers had passed, but bryony
mantled the bushes in luxuriant beauty, and kingly teazles raised
their diademed heads, and exultingly stretched forth their
sceptred arms.&nbsp; Purple heather mixed with fragrant thyme,
blue harebells and pale bents of quiver-grass edged the path, and
thistledown, drifting from the chalk uplands, lay like snow in
the hollows, or danced like living things on the path before
her.&nbsp; A brood of goldfinches, with merry twitter and
flashing wings, flitted round a tall milk thistle with variegated
leaves and a <!-- page 369--><a name="page369"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 369</span>little farther on, just at the
opening of a glade from the path, she beheld a huge dragon-fly,
banded with green, black, and gold, poised on wings invisible in
their rapid motion, and hawking for insects.&nbsp; She stood to
watch, collecting materials to please Miss Charlecote, and make a
story for Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stand still.&nbsp; He is upon you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw Miss Charlecote a few yards off, nearly on all-fours
in the thymy grass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a grasshopper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only once seen
such a fellow.&nbsp; He makes portentous leaps.&nbsp; There! on
your flounce!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have him!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; He went right over
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got him under my handkerchief.&nbsp; Put
your hand in my pocket&mdash;take out a little wide-mouthed
bottle.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Get in, sir, it is of no use
to bite.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an air-hole in the cork.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t he a beauty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, the lovely green!&nbsp; What saws he wears on his
thighs!&nbsp; See the delicate pink lining!&nbsp; What horns! and
a quaint face, like a horse&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The appearance of them is as the appearance of
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that this is a locust, only a
<i>gryllus</i>, happily for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the difference?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Long or short horns, since Bertha is not here to make
me call them antenn&aelig;.&nbsp; I must take him home to draw,
as soon as I have gathered some willow for my puss.&nbsp; You are
coming home with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant to drink tea with you, and be sent for in the
evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good child.&nbsp; I was almost coming to you, but I was
afraid of Mervyn.&nbsp; How has it been, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s &lsquo;he is very kind&rsquo; was allowed
to stand for the present, and Honora led the way by a favourite
path, which was new to Ph&oelig;be, making the circuit of the
Holt; sometimes dipping into a hollow, over which the lesser
scabious cast a tint like the gray of a cloud; sometimes rising
on a knoll so as to look down on the rounded tops of the trees,
following the undulations of the grounds; and beyond them the
green valley, winding stream, and harvest fields, melting into
the chalk downs on the horizon.&nbsp; To Ph&oelig;be, all had the
freshness of novelty, with the charm of familiarity, and without
the fatigue of admiration required by the show-places to which
Mervyn had taken her.&nbsp; Presently Miss Charlecote opened the
wicket leading to an oak coppice.&nbsp; There was hardly any
brushwood.&nbsp; The ground was covered with soft grass and round
elastic cushions of gray lichen.&nbsp; There were a few brackens,
and here and there the crimson midsummer men, but the copsewood
consisted of the redundant shoots of the old, gnarled, knotted
stumps, covered with handsome foliage of the pale sea-green of
later summer, and the leaves far exceeding in size those either
of the sapling or the full-sized tree&mdash;vigorous playfulness
of the poor old wounded stocks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Honor, pausing, &lsquo;here I found my
purple emperor, sunning himself, his glorious wings wide open,
looking black at <!-- page 370--><a name="page370"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 370</span>first, but turning out to be of
purple-velvet, of the opaque mysterious beauty which seems nobler
than mere lustre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you keep him?&nbsp; I thought that was against your
principles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only mocked him by trying to paint him.&nbsp; He was
mine because he came to delight me with the pleasure of having
seen him, and the remembrance of him that pervades the
path.&nbsp; It was just where Humfrey always told me the
creatures might be found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was Mr. Charlecote fond of natural history?&rsquo;
asked Ph&oelig;be, shyly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not as natural history, but he knew bird, beast,
insect, and tree, with a friendly hearty intimacy, such as
Cockney writers ascribe to peasants, but which they never
have.&nbsp; While he used the homeliest names, a dish-washer for
a wagtail, cuckoo&rsquo;s bread-and-cheese for wood-sorrel
(partly I believe to tease me), he knew them thoroughly, nests,
haunts, and all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could not help quoting the old lines, &lsquo;He
prayeth well that loveth well both man and bird and
beast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and some persons have a curious affinity with the
gentle and good in creation&mdash;who can watch and even handle a
bird&rsquo;s nest without making it be deserted, whom bees do not
sting, and horses, dogs, and cats love so as to reveal their best
instincts in a way that seems fabulous.&nbsp; In spite of the
Lyra Innocentium, I think this is less often the case with
children than with such grown people as&mdash;like your guardian,
Ph&oelig;be&mdash;have kept something of the majesty and calmness
of innocence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was all in a glow with the pleasure of hearing him
so called, but bashful under that very delight, she said,
&lsquo;Perhaps part of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom was in loving these
things, since he knew the plants from the cedar to the
hyssop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And spoke of Nature so beautifully in his Song, but I
am afraid as he grew old he must have lost his healthful pleasure
in them when he was lifted up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or did he only make them learning and ornament, instead
of a joy and devotion?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, thinking of the
difference between Bertha&rsquo;s love and Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor does he say that he found vanity in them, though he
did in his own gardens and pools of water.&nbsp; No, the longer I
live, the more sure I am that these things are meant for our
solace and minor help through the trials of life.&nbsp; I assure
you, Ph&oelig;be, that the crimson leaf of a Herb-Robert in the
hedge has broken a strain of fretful repining, and it is one
great blessing in these pleasures that one never can exhaust
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be saw that Miss Charlecote was right in her own
case, when on coming in, the grasshopper&rsquo;s name and history
were sought, and there followed an exhibition of the
&lsquo;puss&rsquo; for whom the willow had been gathered, namely
a grass-green caterpillar, with a kitten&rsquo;s face, a curious
upright head and shoulders, and two purple tails, whence on
irritation two pink filaments <!-- page 371--><a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>protruded,&mdash;lashes for the ichneumons, as Honora
explained.&nbsp; The lonely woman&rsquo;s interest in her quaint
pet showed how thickly are strewn round us many a calm and
innocent mode of solace and cheerfulness if we knew but how to
avail ourselves of it.</p>
<p>Honora had allowed the conversation to be thus desultory and
indifferent, thinking that it gave greater rest to Ph&oelig;be,
and it was not till the evening was advancing, that she began to
discharge herself of an urgent commission from Robert, by saying,
&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, I want you to do something for me.&nbsp;
There is that little dame&rsquo;s school in your hamlet.&nbsp; It
is too far off for me to look after, I wish you would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robin has been writing to me about parish work,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be, sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I ought, but I
don&rsquo;t know how, and I can&rsquo;t bear that any change in
our ways should be observed;&rsquo; and the tears came more
speedily than Honor had expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear child,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;there is no need
for that feeling.&nbsp; Parish work, at least in a lay family,
must depend on the amount of home duty.&nbsp; In the last years
of my dear mother&rsquo;s life I had to let everything go, and I
know it is not easy to resume, still less to begin, but you will
be glad to have done so, and will find it a great
comfort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be my duty, I must try,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
dejectedly, &lsquo;and I suppose it is.&nbsp; Will you come and
show me what to do?&nbsp; I never went into a cottage in my
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have spoken too soon! thought Honor; yet Robert urged me,
and besides the evil of neglecting the poor, the work will do her
good; but it breaks one&rsquo;s heart to see this meek, mournful
obedience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we are alone,&rsquo; continued Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;I can fix times, and do as I please, but I cannot tell
what Mervyn may want me to do when he is at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you expect that he will wish you to go out with
him?&rsquo; asked Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not this autumn,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;but he
finds it so dull at home, that I fully expect he will have his
friends to stay with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, let me strongly advise you to keep aloof
from your brother&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; When they are in the
house, live entirely in the schoolroom.&nbsp; If you begin at
once as a matter of course, he will see the propriety, and
acquiesce.&nbsp; You are not vexed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I believe it is all right.&nbsp; Robert will
be the more at ease about us.&nbsp; I only do not like to act as
if I distrusted Mervyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would not be discreet for any girl so young as you
are to be entertaining her brother&rsquo;s sporting
friends.&nbsp; You could hardly do so without acquiring the same
kind of reputation as my poor Lucy&rsquo;s Rashe, which he would
not wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be more heartily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have shown me the way out of a difficulty.&nbsp; I
need not go into company at all this winter, and after that, only
with our old country neighbours.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>Honora was infinitely relieved at having bestowed this
piece of advice, on which she had agreed with Robert as the only
means of insuring Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s being sheltered from
society that Mervyn might not esteem so bad for his sister as
they did.</p>
<p>The quietness of Mervyn&rsquo;s absence did much for the
restoration of Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s spirits.&nbsp; The
dame&rsquo;s school was not delightful to her; she had not begun
early enough in life for ease, but she did her tasks there as a
duty, and was amply rewarded by the new enjoyment thus afforded
to Maria.&nbsp; The importance of being surrounded by a ring of
infants, teaching the alphabet, guiding them round the gooseberry
bush, or leading their songs and hymns, was felicity
indescribable to Maria.&nbsp; She learnt each name, and, with the
reiteration that no one could endure save Ph&oelig;be and
faithful Lieschen, rehearsed the individual alphabetical
acquirements of every one; she painted pictures for them, hemmed
pinafores, and was happier than she had ever been in her life, as
well as less fretful and more manageable, and she even began to
develop more sense and intelligence in this direction than she
had seemed capable of under the dreary round of lessons past her
comprehension.</p>
<p>It was a great stimulus to Ph&oelig;be, and spurred her to
personal parish work, going beyond the soup and subscriptions
that might have bounded her charities for want of knowing
better.&nbsp; Of course the worst and most plausible people took
her in, and Miss Charlecote sometimes scolded, sometimes laughed
at her, but the beginning was made, and Robert was pleased.</p>
<p>Mervyn did bring home some shooting friends, but he made no
difficulties as to the seclusion that Miss Charlecote had
recommended for his sister; accepting it so easily that
Ph&oelig;be thought he must have intended it from the
first.&nbsp; From that time he was seldom at home without one or
more guests&mdash;an arrangement that kept the young ladies
chiefly to the west wing, and always, when in the garden, forced
them to be on their guard against stumbling upon smoking
gentlemen.&nbsp; It was a late-houred, noisy company, and the
sounds that reached the sisters made the younger girls curious,
and the governess anxious.&nbsp; Perhaps it was impossible that
girls of seventeen and fifteen should not be excited by the
vicinity of moustaches and beards whom they were bidden to avoid;
and even the alternate French and German which Miss Fennimore
enforced on Bertha more strongly than ever, merely produced the
variety of her descanting on their <i>knebelbarten</i>, or on
<i>l&rsquo;heure &agrave; guelle les voix de ces
messieurs-l&agrave; entonnaient sur le grand escalier</i>, till
Miss Fennimore declared that she would have Latin and Greek
talked if there were no word for a gentleman in either!&nbsp;
There were always stories to be told of Bertha&rsquo;s narrow
escapes of being overtaken by them in garden or corridor, till
Maria, infected by the panic, used to flounder away as if from a
beast of prey, and being as tall as, and considerably stouter
than, Ph&oelig;be, with the shuffling gait of the imbecile, would
produce a <!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>volume of sound that her sister
always feared might attract notice, and irritate Mervyn.</p>
<p>Honora Charlecote tried to give pleasure to the sisters by
having them at the Holt, and would fain have treated Bertha as
one of the inherited godchildren.&nbsp; But Bertha proved by
reference to the brass tablet that she <i>could</i> not be
godchild to a man who died three years before her birth, and it
was then perceived that his sponsorship had been to an elder
Bertha, who had died in infancy, of water on the head, and whom
her parents, in their impatience of sorrow, had absolutely caused
to be forgotten.&nbsp; Such a delusion in the exact Ph&oelig;be
could only be accounted for by her tenderness to Mr. Charlecote,
and it gave Bertha a subject of triumph of which she availed
herself to the utmost.&nbsp; She had imbibed a sovereign contempt
for Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s capacity, and considered her as
embodying the passive individual who is to be instructed or
confuted in a scientific dialogue.&nbsp; So she lost no occasion
of triumphantly denouncing all &lsquo;cataclysms&rsquo; of the
globe, past or future, of resolving all nature into gases, or
arguing upon duality&mdash;a subject that fortunately usually
brought on her hesitation of speech, a misfortune of which Miss
Fennimore and Ph&oelig;be would unscrupulously avail themselves
to change the conversation.&nbsp; The bad taste and impertinence
were quite as apparent to the governess as to the sister, and
though Bertha never admitted a doubt of having carried the day
against the old world prejudices, yet Miss Fennimore perceived,
not only that Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s notions were not of the
contracted and unreasonable order that had been ascribed to her,
but that liberality in her pupil was more uncandid, narrow, and
self-sufficient than was &lsquo;credulity&rsquo; in Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; Honor was more amused than annoyed at these
discussions; she was sorry for the silly, conceited girl, though
not in the least offended nor disturbed, but Ph&oelig;be and Miss
Fennimore considered them such an exposure that they were by no
means willing to give Bertha the opportunity of launching herself
at her senior.</p>
<p>The state of the household likewise perplexed
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; She had been bred up to the sight of waste,
ostentation, and extravagance, and they did not distress her; but
her partial authority revealed to her glimpses of dishonesty;
detected falsehoods destroyed her confidence in the housekeeper;
her attempts at charities to the poor were intercepted; her
visits to the hamlet disclosed to her some of the effects on the
villagers of a vicious, disorderly establishment; and she
understood why a careful mother would as soon have sent her
daughter to service at the lowest public-house as at
Beauchamp.</p>
<p>Mervyn had detected one of the footmen in a flagrant act of
peculation, and had dismissed him, but Ph&oelig;be believed the
evil to have extended far more widely than he supposed, and made
up her mind to entreat him to investigate matters.&nbsp; In vain,
however, she sought for a favourable moment, for he was never
<!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>alone.&nbsp; The intervals between other visitors were
filled up by a Mr. Hastings, who seemed to have erected himself
into so much of the domesticated friend that he had established a
bowing and speaking acquaintance with Ph&oelig;be; Bertha no
longer narrated her escapes of encounters with him; and, being
the only one of the gentlemen who ever went to church, he often
joined the young ladies as they walked back from thence.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be heartily wished him gone, for he made her brother
inaccessible; she only saw Mervyn when he wanted her to find
something for him or to give her a message, and if she ventured
to say that she wanted to speak to him, he
promised&mdash;&lsquo;Some time or other&rsquo;&mdash;which
always proved <i>sine die</i>.&nbsp; He was looking very ill, his
complexion very much flushed, and his hand heated and unsteady,
and she heard through Lieschen of his having severe morning
headaches, and fits of giddiness and depression, but these seemed
to make him more unable to spare Mr. Hastings, as if life would
not be endurable without the billiards that she sometimes heard
knocking about half the night.</p>
<p>However, the anniversary of Mr. Fulmort&rsquo;s death would
bring his executor to clear off one branch of his business, and
Mervyn&rsquo;s friends fled before the coming of the grave old
lawyer, all fixing the period of their departure before
Christmas.&nbsp; Nor could Mervyn go with them; he must meet Mr.
Crabbe, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart quite bounded at the hope
of being able to walk about the house in comfort, and say part of
what was on her mind to her brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose writing is this?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be to
herself, as the letters were given to her, two days before the
clearance of the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought to know it&mdash;It
is!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Yes, indeed it is&mdash;poor Lucy.&nbsp;
Where can she be?&nbsp; What can she have to say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The letter was dateless, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s amaze grew as
she read.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Ph&oelig;be</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know it is my nature to do odd things, so never
mind that, but attend to me, as one who knows too well what it is
to be motherless and undirected.&nbsp; Gossip is long-tongued
enough to reach me here, in full venom as I know and trust, but
it makes my blood boil, till I can&rsquo;t help writing a warning
that may at least save you pain.&nbsp; I know you are the
snowdrop poor Owen used to call you, and I know you have Honor
Charlecote for philosopher, and friend, but she is nearly as
unsophisticated as yourself, and if report say true, your brother
is getting you into a scrape.&nbsp; If it is a fact that he has
Jack Hastings dangling about Beauchamp, he deserves the lot of my
unlucky Charteris cousins!&nbsp; Mind what you are about,
Ph&oelig;be, if the man is there.&nbsp; He is plausible, clever,
has no end of amusing resources, and keeps his head above water;
but I <i>know</i> that in no place where there are womankind has
he been received without there having been cause to repent
it!&nbsp; I hope you may be able to laugh&mdash;if not, it may be
a wholesome <!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>cure to hear that his friends
believe him to have secured one of the heiresses at
Beauchamp.&nbsp; There, Ph&oelig;be, I have said my say, and I
fear it is cutting and wounding, but it came out of the love of a
heart that has not got rid of some of its old feelings, and that
could not bear to think of sorrow or evil tongues busy about
you.&nbsp; That I write for your sake, not for my own, you may
see by my making it impossible to answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Lucilla
Sandbrook</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;If you hold council with Honor over this&mdash;as, if
you are wise, you will&mdash;you may tell her that I am learning
gratitude to her.&nbsp; I would ask her pardon if I could without
servility.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Secured one of the heiresses!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be
to herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like to be able to tell Lucy
how I can laugh!&nbsp; Poor Lucy, how very kind in her to
write.&nbsp; I wonder whether Mervyn knows how bad the man
is!&nbsp; Shall I go to Miss Charlecote?&nbsp; Oh, no; she is
spending two days at Moorcroft!&nbsp; Shall I tell Miss
Fennimore?&nbsp; No, I think not, it will be wiser to talk to
Miss Charlecote; I don&rsquo;t like to tell Miss Fennimore of
Lucy.&nbsp; Poor Lucy&mdash;she is always generous!&nbsp; He will
soon be gone, and then I can speak to Mervyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This secret was not a serious burthen to Ph&oelig;be, though
she could not help smiling to herself at the comical notion of
having been secured by a man to whom she had not spoken a dozen
times, and then with the utmost coldness and formality.</p>
<p>The next day she approached the letter-bag with some
curiosity.&nbsp; It contained one for her from her sister
Juliana, a very unusual correspondent, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
mind misgave her lest it should have any connection with the
hints in Lucilla&rsquo;s note.&nbsp; But she was little prepared
for what she read.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Acton Manor, Dec.
24th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ph&oelig;be</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Although, after what passed in July, I cannot suppose
that the opinion of your elders can have any effect on your
proceedings, yet for the sake of our relationship, as well as of
regard to appearances, I cannot forbear endeavouring to rescue
you from the consequences of your own folly and obstinacy.&nbsp;
Nothing better was to be expected from Mervyn; but at your age,
with your pretences to religion, you cannot plead simplicity, nor
ignorance of the usages of the world.&nbsp; Neither Sir Bevil nor
myself can express our amazement at your recklessness, thus
forfeiting the esteem of society, and outraging the opinion of
our old friends.&nbsp; To put an end to the impropriety, we will
at once receive you here, overlooking any inconvenience, and we
shall expect you all three on Tuesday, under charge of Miss
Fennimore, who seems to have been about as fit as Maria to think
for you.&nbsp; It is too late to write to Mervyn to-night, but he
shall hear from us to-morrow, as well as from your guardian, to
whom Sir Bevil has written, You had better bring my jewels; <!--
page 376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>and the buhl clock from my mother&rsquo;s mantelshelf,
which I was to have.&nbsp; Mrs. Brisbane will pack them.&nbsp;
Tell Bertha, with my love, that she might have been more explicit
in her correspondence.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your affectionate sister,<br
/>
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Juliana Acton</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Miss Fennimore entered the room, she found Ph&oelig;be
sitting like one petrified, only just able to hold out the
letter, and murmur&mdash;&lsquo;What does it mean?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Imagining that it could only contain something fatal about
Robert, Miss Fennimore sprang at the paper, and glanced through
it, while Ph&oelig;be again faintly asked, &lsquo;What have I
done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Acton is pleased to be mysterious!&rsquo; said the
governess.&nbsp; &lsquo;The kind sister she always
was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be,
rallying.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must be something shocking, for Sir
Bevil thinks so too,&rsquo; and the tears sprang forth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will never think anything unkind of you, my
dear,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, with emphasis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be about Mr. Hastings!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
gathering recollection and confidence.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not
like to tell you yesterday, but I had a letter from poor Lucy
Sandbrook.&nbsp; Some friends of that man, Mr. Hastings, have set
it about that he is going to be married to me!&rsquo; and
Ph&oelig;be laughed outright.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Juliana has heard
it, I don&rsquo;t wonder that she is shocked, because you know
Miss Charlecote said it would never do for me to associate with
those gentlemen, and besides, Lucy says that he is a very bad
man.&nbsp; I shall write to Juliana, and say that I have never
had anything to do with him, and he is going away to-morrow, and
Mervyn must be told not to have him back again.&nbsp; That will
set it all straight at Acton Manor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was quite herself again.&nbsp; She was too well
accustomed to gratuitous unkindness and reproaches from Juliana
to be much hurt by them, and perceiving, as she thought, where
the misconception lay, had no fears that it would not be cleared
up.&nbsp; So when she had carefully written her letter to her
sister, she dismissed the subject until she should be able to lay
it before Miss Charlecote, dwelling more on Honor&rsquo;s
pleasure on hearing of Lucy than on the more personal matter.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore, looking over the letter, had deeper
misgivings.&nbsp; It seemed to her rather to be a rebuke for the
whole habit of life than a warning against an individual, and she
began to doubt whether even the seclusion of the west wing had
been a sufficient protection in the eyes of the family from the
contamination of such society as Mervyn received.&nbsp; Or was it
a plot of Lady Acton&rsquo;s malevolence for hunting Ph&oelig;be
away from her home?&nbsp; Miss Fennimore fell asleep, uneasy and
perplexed, and in her dreams beheld Ph&oelig;be as the Lady in
Comus, fixed in her chair and resolute against a cup effervescing
with carbonic <!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 377</span>acid gas, proffered by Jack
Hastings, who thereupon gave it to Bertha, as she lay back in the
dentist&rsquo;s chair, and both becoming transformed into
pterodactyles, flew away while Miss Fennimore was vainly trying
to summon the brothers by electric telegraph.</p>
<p>There was a whole bevy of letters for Ph&oelig;be the
following morning, and first a kind sensible one from her
guardian, much regretting to learn that Mr. Fulmort&rsquo;s
guests were undesirable inmates for a house where young ladies
resided, so that, though he had full confidence in Miss
Fulmort&rsquo;s discretion, and understood that she had never
associated with the persons in question, he thought her residence
at home ought to be reconsidered, and should be happy to discuss
the point on coming to Beauchamp, so soon as he should have
recovered from an unfortunate fit of the gout, which at present
detained him in town.&nbsp; Miss Fulmort might, however, be
assured that her wishes should be his chief consideration, and
that he would take care not to separate her from Miss Maria.</p>
<p>That promise, and the absence of all mention of
Lucilla&rsquo;s object of dread, gave Ph&oelig;be courage to open
the missive from her eldest sister.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Ph&oelig;be</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always told you it would never answer, and you see I
was right.&nbsp; If Mervyn will invite that horrid man, whatever
you may do, no one will believe that you do not associate with
him, and you may never get over it.&nbsp; I am telling everybody
what children you are, quite in the schoolroom, but nothing will
be of any use but your coming away at once, and appearing in
society with me, so you had better send the children to Acton
Manor, and come to me next week.&nbsp; If there are any teal in
the decoy bring some, and ask Mervyn where he got that
Barton&rsquo;s dry champagne.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your affectionate sister,<br
/>
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Augusta Bannerman</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She had kept Robert&rsquo;s letter to the last, as refreshment
after the rest.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;St.
Matthew&rsquo;s, Dec. 18th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ph&oelig;be</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid this may not be your first intimation of
what may vex and grieve you greatly, and what calls for much cool
and anxious judgment.&nbsp; In you we have implicit confidence,
and your adherence to Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s kind advice has
spared you all imputation, though not, I fear, all pain.&nbsp;
You may, perhaps, not know how disgraceful are the characters of
some of the persons whom Mervyn has collected about him.&nbsp; I
do him the justice to believe that he would shelter you from all
intercourse with them as carefully as I should; but I cannot
forgive his having brought them beneath the same roof with
you.&nbsp; I fear the fact has done harm in our own
neighbourhood.&nbsp; People <!-- page 378--><a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>imagine you
to be associating with Mervyn&rsquo;s crew, and a monstrous
report is abroad which has caused Bevil Acton to write to me and
to Crabbe.&nbsp; We all agree that this is a betrayal of the
confidence that you expressed in Mervyn, and that while he
chooses to make his house a scene of dissipation, no seclusion
can render it a fit residence for women or girls.&nbsp; I fear
you will suffer much in learning this decision, for
Mervyn&rsquo;s sake as well as your own.&nbsp; Poor fellow! if he
will bring evil spirits about him, good angels must depart.&nbsp;
I would come myself, but that my presence would embitter Mervyn,
and I could not meet him properly.&nbsp; I am writing to Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; If she should propose to receive you all at the
Holt immediately, until Crabbe&rsquo;s most inopportune gout is
over, you had better go thither at once.&nbsp; It would be the
most complete vindication of your conduct that could be offered
to the county, and would give time for considering of
establishing you elsewhere, and still under Miss
Fennimore&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; For Bertha&rsquo;s sake as well as
your own, you must be prepared to leave home and resign yourself
to be passive in the decision of those bound to think for you, by
which means you may avoid being included in Mervyn&rsquo;s
anger.&nbsp; Do not distress yourself by the fear that any blame
can attach to you or to Miss Fennimore; I copy Bevil&rsquo;s
expressions&mdash;&ldquo;Assure Ph&oelig;be that though her
generous confidence may have caused her difficulties, no one can
entertain a doubt of her guileless intention and maidenly
discretion.&nbsp; If it would not make further mischief, I would
hasten to fetch her, but if she will do me the honour to accept
her sister&rsquo;s invitation, I hope to do all in my power to
make her happy and mark my esteem for her.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are
his words; but I suppose you will hardly prefer Acton Manor,
though, should the Holt fail us, you might send the other two to
the Manor, and come to Albury-street as Augusta wishes, when we
could consult together on some means of keeping you united, and
retaining Miss Fennimore, who must not be thrown over, as it
would be an injury to her prospects.&nbsp; Tell her from me that
I look to her for getting you through this unpleasant
business.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your ever affectionate<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">R. M. Fulmort</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ph&oelig;be never spoke, but handed each sheet as she finished
it to her governess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promise me, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, as
she came to Robert&rsquo;s last sentence, &lsquo;that none of
these considerations shall bias you.&nbsp; Make no struggle for
me, but use me as I may be most serviceable to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, instead of answering, kissed and clung to
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of doing?&rsquo; asked the
governess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You looked as if a thought had occurred to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only recollected the words, &ldquo;your strength is
to sit still,&rdquo; <!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;and thought
how well they agreed with Robert&rsquo;s advice to be
passive.&nbsp; Mr. Crabbe has promised not to separate us, and I
will trust to that.&nbsp; Mervyn was very kind in letting us stay
here, but he does not want us, and will not miss
us,&rsquo;&mdash;and with those words, quiet as they were, came a
gush of irrepressible tears, just as a step resounded outside,
the door was burst open, and Mervyn hurried in, purple with
passion, and holding a bundle of letters crushed together in his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he hoarsely cried, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s
all this?&nbsp; Who has been telling infamous tales of my
house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot tell&mdash;&rsquo; began Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know anything of this?&rsquo; he interrupted,
fiercely turning on Miss Fennimore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, sir.&nbsp; The letters which your sister has
received have equally surprised and distressed me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then they have set on you, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; The whole
pack in full cry, as if it mattered to them whether I chose to
have the Old Gentleman in the house, so long as he did not meddle
with you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Fulmort,&rsquo; interposed the
governess, &lsquo;the remonstrance is quite just.&nbsp; Had I
been aware of the character of some of your late guests, I could
not have wished your sisters to remain in the house with
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are these your sentiments, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; he
asked, sternly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid they ought to be,&rsquo; she sadly
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silly child; so this pack of censorious women and
parsons have frightened you into giving me up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sisters do not give up brothers, Mervyn.&nbsp; You know
how I thank you for having me here, but I could not amuse you, or
make it pleasant to you, so there must be an end of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So they hunt you out to be bullied by Juliana, or
slaved to death by Augusta, which is it to be?&nbsp; Or maybe
Robert has got his sisterhood cut and dried for you; only mind,
he shan&rsquo;t make away with your &pound;30,000 while I live to
expose those popish tricks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Mervyn,&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, all in a
glow; &lsquo;I will not hear Robert so spoken of: he is always
kind and good, and has taught me every right thing I
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, very well; and pray when does he summon you from
among the ungodly?&nbsp; Will the next train be soon
enough?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mervyn!&nbsp; Your friends go to-day,
don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Mr. Crabbe does not desire any change to
be made before he comes to see about it.&nbsp; May we not stay
till that time, and spend our Christmas together?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must ask Robert and Juliana, since you prefer
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with spirit; &lsquo;it is
right to attend to my elder sisters, and Robert has always helped
and taught me, and I must trust his guidance, as I always have
done.&nbsp; And I trust you too, Mervyn.&nbsp; You never thought
you were doing us any harm.&nbsp; I may trust you still,&rsquo;
she added, with so sweet <!-- page 380--><a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>and
imploring a look that Mervyn gave an odd laugh, with some feeling
in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harm?&nbsp; Great harm I have done this creature,
eh?&rsquo; he said, with his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Few could do <i>her</i> harm, Mr. Fulmort,&rsquo; said
the governess, &lsquo;but report may have done some mischief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who cares for report!&nbsp; I say, Ph&oelig;be, we will
laugh at them all.&nbsp; You pluck up a spirit, stay with me, and
we&rsquo;ll entertain all the county, and then get some great
swell to bring you out in town, and see what Juliana will
say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will stay with you while you are alone, and Mr.
Crabbe lets me,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old fool of a fellow!&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t my
father have made me your guardian, and then there would have been
none of this row!&nbsp; One would think I had had her down to act
barmaid to the fellows.&nbsp; And you never spoke to one, did
you, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only now and then to Mr. Hastings.&nbsp; I could not
help it after the day he came into the study when I was copying
for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well! that is nothing&mdash;nobody minds old
Jack.&nbsp; I shall let them all know you were as safe as a
Turk&rsquo;s wife in a harem, and maybe old Crabbe will hear
reason if we get him down here alone, without a viper at each
ear, as he had last time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With which words Mervyn departed, and Miss Fennimore exclaimed
in some displeasure, &lsquo;You can never think of remaining,
Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid not,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;Mervyn
does not seem to know what is proper for us, and I am too young
to judge, so I suppose we must go.&nbsp; I wish I could make him
happy with music, or books, or anything a woman could do!&nbsp;
If you please, I think I must go over to the Holt.&nbsp; I cannot
settle to anything just yet, and I shall answer my letters better
when I have seen Miss Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact Ph&oelig;be felt herself going to her other guardian;
but as she left the room, Bertha came hurriedly in from the
garden, with a plaid thrown round her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; she
hastily asked, following Ph&oelig;be to her room.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
there an end of all these mysteries?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;Miss Fennimore is
ready for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if that were all I wanted to know.&nbsp; Do you
think I did not hear Mervyn storming like a lion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry you did hear,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;for it was not pleasant.&nbsp; It seems that it is not
thought proper for us to live here while Mervyn has so many
gentleman-guests, so,&rsquo; with a sigh, &lsquo;you will have
your wish, Bertha.&nbsp; They mean us to go away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not my wish now,&rsquo; said Bertha, pulling pins
in and out of Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s pincushion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
not the child I was in the summer.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go,
Ph&oelig;be; I know you can get your way, if you try for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must try to be put in the right way, Bertha, that is
all I want.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 381--><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
381</span>&lsquo;And you are going to the Holt for the most
precise, narrow-minded way you can get.&nbsp; I wish I were in
your place, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had Ph&oelig;be driven from the door, before she saw
Miss Charlecote crossing the grass on foot, and after the
interchange of a few words, it was agreed to talk while driving
on towards Elverslope.&nbsp; Each was laden with the same
subject, for not only had Honor heard from Robert, but during her
visit to Moorcroft she had become enlightened on the gossip that
seldom reached the Holt, and had learnt that the whole
neighbourhood was scandalized at the Beauchamp doings, and was
therefore shy of taking notice of the young people there.&nbsp;
She had been incredulous at first, then extremely shocked and
distressed, and though in part convinced that more than she
guessed had passed beyond the west wing, she had come primed with
a representation which she cautiously administered to
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; The girl was more indignant on her
brother&rsquo;s account than alarmed on her own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that is the way the Raymonds talk of Mervyn,&rsquo;
cried she, &lsquo;no wonder they made their niece cast him off,
and drive him to despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was no unkindness of the Raymonds, my dear.&nbsp;
They were only sorry for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not want them to be sorry for me; they ought to be
sorry for Mervyn,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, almost petulantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps they are,&rsquo; said Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
was only in kindness that they spoke, and they had almost
anticipated my explanation that you were kept entirely
apart.&nbsp; Every gentleman hereabouts who has been at Beauchamp
has declared such to be the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think so!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;Mervyn knows how to take care of us better than
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But all ladies do not seem willing to believe as much,
shame on them,&rsquo; said Honor; &lsquo;and, tell me,
Ph&oelig;be, have people called on you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not many, but I have not called on them since they left
their cards of inquiry.&nbsp; I had been thinking whether I
ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will consider.&nbsp; Perhaps I had better take you
round some day, but I have been a very remiss protector, my poor
child, if all be true that I am told of some of Mervyn&rsquo;s
friends.&nbsp; It was an insult to have them under the same roof
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you look at this letter?&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is very kind&mdash;it is from
Lucy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These plain words alone occurred to Ph&oelig;be as a
preparation for a letter that was sure to move Miss Charlecote
greatly, if only by the slight of not having written to her, the
most obvious person.&nbsp; But the flighty generosity, and deep
though inconsistent feeling were precious, and the proud
relenting of the message at the end touched Honor with
hope.&nbsp; They laughed at the report that had elicited
Lucilla&rsquo;s letter, but the reserve of the <!-- page 382--><a
name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 382</span>warning
about Mr. Hastings, coming from the once unscrupulous girl,
startled Honor even more than what she had heard at
Moorcroft.&nbsp; Was the letter to be answered?&nbsp; Yes, by all
means, cried Honor, catching at any link of communication.&nbsp;
She could discover Lucilla&rsquo;s address, and was sure that
even brief thanks and explanations from Ph&oelig;be would be good
for Lucy.</p>
<p>Like Miss Fennimore, Honor was surprised by
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s composure under her share of the evil
report.&nbsp; The strictures which would have been dreadful to an
older person seemed to fly over her innocent head, their force
either uncomprehended or unfelt.&nbsp; She yielded implicitly to
the propriety of the change, but her grief was at the family
quarrel, the leaving home, and the unmerited degree of blame cast
on Mervyn, not the aspersions on herself; although, as Honor
became vexed at her calmness, she withheld none of them in the
desire to convince her of the expediency of leaving Beauchamp at
once for the Holt.&nbsp; No, even though this was Robert&rsquo;s
wish, Ph&oelig;be could still not see the necessity, as long as
Mervyn should be alone.&nbsp; If he should bring any of his
discreditable friends, she promised at once to come to Miss
Charlecote, but otherwise she could perceive no reason for
grieving him, and astonishing the world, by implying that his
sisters could not stay in his house.&nbsp; She thought him
unwell, too, and wished to watch him, and, on the whole, did not
regret her guardian&rsquo;s gout, which would give her a little
more time at home, and put off the discussion till there should
be less anger.</p>
<p>Is this weak? is it childish indifference? thought Honor, or
is it a spirit superior to the selfish personal dread that would
proclaim its own injured innocence by a vehement commotion.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be rejoiced that she had secured her interview with
her friend, for when the guests were gone, Mervyn claimed her
whole attention, and was vexed if she were not continually at his
back.&nbsp; After their <i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;te</i>
dinner, he kept her sitting over the dessert while he drank his
wine.&nbsp; She tried this opportunity of calling his attention
to the frauds of the servants, but he merely laughed his mocking
laugh at her simplicity in supposing that everybody&rsquo;s
servants did not cheat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Ha&mdash;ha!&nbsp; Why,
she&rsquo;s the very mark for imposition, and hypocrisy into the
bargain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be did not believe it, but would not argue the point,
returning to that nearer home.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nonsense,
Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only a choice who
shall prey upon one, and if I have a set that will do it with a
civil countenance, and let me live out of the spoil, I&rsquo;ll
not be bothered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot think it need go on so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t; I shall break up the concern, and
let the house, or something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let the house?&nbsp; Oh, Mervyn! I thought you meant to
be a county man.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 383--><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>&lsquo;Let those look to that who have hindered
me,&rsquo; said Mervyn, fiercely swallowing one glassful, and
pouring out another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should you live in London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At Jericho, for aught I care, or any one
else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her attempt to controvert this remark brought on a tirade
against the whole family, which she would not keep up by reply,
and which ended in moody silence.&nbsp; Again she tried to rise,
but he asked why she could not stay with him five minutes, and
went on absently pouring out wine and drinking it, till, as the
clock struck nine, the bottom of the decanter was reached, when
he let her lead the way to the drawing-room, and there taking up
the paper, soon fell asleep, then awoke at ten at the sound of
her moving to go to bed, and kept her playing piquet for an hour
and a half.</p>
<p>An evening or two of this kind convinced Ph&oelig;be that even
with Mervyn alone it was not a desirable life.&nbsp; She was less
shocked than a girl used to a higher standard at home might have
been, but that daily bottle and perpetual cards weighed on her
imagination, and she felt that her younger sisters ought not to
grow up to such a spectacle.&nbsp; Still her loving heart yearned
over Mervyn, who was very fond of her, and consulted her pleasure
continually in his own peculiar and selfish way, although often
exceedingly cross to her as well as to every one else; but this
ill-temper was so visibly the effect of low spirits that she
easily endured and forgave it.&nbsp; She saw that he was both
unwell and unhappy.&nbsp; She could not think what would become
of him when the present arrangement should be broken up; but
could only cling to him, as long as she could pity him.&nbsp; It
was no wonder that on the Sunday, Honora seeing her enter the
church, could only help being reminded of the expression of that
child-saint of Raffaelle, wandering alone through the
dragon-haunted wood, wistful and distressed, yet so confident in
the Unseen Guide and Guardian that she treads down evils and
perils in innocence, unconscious of her full danger and of their
full blackness.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<blockquote><p>Close within us we will carry, strong, collected,
calm, and brave,<br />
The true panoply of quiet which the bad world never gave;<br />
Very serpents in discretion, yet as guileless as the dove,<br />
Lo! obedience is the watchword, and the countersign is love.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On the next hunting day, Mervyn took Ph&oelig;be with him to
the meet, upon a favourite common towards Elverslope, where on a
fine morning ladies were as apt to be found as hounds and
huntsmen, so that she would be at no loss for companions when he
left her.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be rode, as she did everything else, well, quietly
and firmly, and she looked very young and fresh, with her rounded
<!-- page 384--><a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>rosy cheeks and chin.&nbsp; Her fair hair was parted
back under a round hat, her slenderly plump figure appeared to
advantage mounted on her bright bay, and altogether she presented
a striking contrast to her brother.&nbsp; She had not seen him in
hunting costume for nearly a year, and she observed with pain how
much he had lost his good looks; his well-made youthful air was
passing away, and his features were becoming redder and coarser;
but he was in his best humour, good-natured, and as nearly gay as
he ever was; and Ph&oelig;be enjoyed her four-miles&rsquo; ride
in the beauty of a warm December&rsquo;s day, the sun shining on
dewy hedges, and robins and thrushes trying to treat the weather
like spring, as they sang amid the rich stores of coral fruit
that hung as yet untouched on every hawthorn or eglantine.</p>
<p>The ladies mustered strong on the smooth turf of the chalk
down bordering the copse which was being drawn.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be
looked out for acquaintance, but a few gentlemen coming up to
greet her, she did not notice, as Mervyn did, that the girls with
whom he had wished to leave her had become intent on some doings
in the copse, and had trotted off with their father.&nbsp; He
made his way to the barouche where sat the <i>grande dame</i> of
the county, exchanged civilities, and asked leave to introduce
his sister.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, who had never seen the lady
before, thought nothing of the cold distant bow; it was for
Mervyn, who knew what her greetings could be, to fume and rage
inwardly.&nbsp; Other acknowledgments passed, but no party had
approached or admitted Ph&oelig;be, and when the hounds went
away, she was still riding alone with her brother and a young
officer.&nbsp; She bade them not to mind her, she would ride home
with the servant, and as all were in motion, she had enough to do
to hold in her horse, while Mervyn and his friend dashed forward,
and soon she found herself alone, except for the groom; the field
were well away over the down, the carriages driving off, the
mounted maidens following the chase as far as the way was fair
and lady-like.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had no mind to do so.&nbsp; Her isolation made her
feel forlorn, and brought home Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s words as
to the opinion entertained of her by the world.&nbsp; Poor child,
something like a tear came into her eye and a blush to her cheek,
but, &lsquo;never mind,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;they will
believe Miss Charlecote, and she will take care of me.&nbsp; If
only Mervyn will not get angry, and make an uproar!&nbsp; I shall
soon be gone away!&nbsp; When shall I come back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rode up to the highest part of the down for a take-leave
gaze.&nbsp; There lay Elverslope in its basin-like valley scooped
out in the hills, with the purple bloom of autumnal haze veiling
its red brick and slate; there, on the other side, the copses and
arable fields dipped and rose, and rose and dipped again, till
the undulations culminated in the tall fir-trees in the Holt
garden, the landmark of the country; and on the bare slope to the
west, <!-- page 385--><a name="page385"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 385</span>Beauchamp&rsquo;s pillars and
pediment made a stately speck in the landscape.&nbsp; &lsquo;Home
no longer!&rsquo; thought Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;there will be
strangers there&mdash;and we shall be on the world!&nbsp; Oh! why
cannot Mervyn be like Robert?&nbsp; How happy we could
be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Beauchamp had not been a perfect Eden in itself, but still it
had all the associations of the paradise of her guileless
childhood; and to her the halo around it would always have the
radiance of the loving spirit through which she viewed it.&nbsp;
The undefined future was hard to bear, but she thought of Robert,
and of the promise that neither her sisters nor Miss Fennimore
should be parted from her, and tried to rest thankful on that
comfort.</p>
<p>She had left the down for the turnpike road, the sounds of the
hunt often reaching her, with glimpses of men and dogs in the
distance taking a direction parallel with her own.&nbsp;
Presently a red coat glanced through the hedge of one of the
cross lanes, as if coming towards the road, and as she reached
the opening at the end, a signal was made to her to stop.&nbsp;
Foreboding some accident, she hastily turned up the narrow white
muddy lane, and was met by an elderly gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rsquo; he said kindly;
&lsquo;only your brother seems rather unwell, and I thought I had
best see him under your charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn was by this time in sight, advancing slowly, and
Ph&oelig;be with rapid thanks rode on to meet him.&nbsp; She knew
that dull, confused, dazzled eye belonged to his giddy fits, and
did not wonder at the half-uttered murmur, rather in the
imprecation line, with which he spoke; but the reel in his saddle
terrified her greatly, and she was dismayed to see that the
gentleman had proceeded into the high road instead of offering
further assistance.&nbsp; She presently perceived that the danger
of falling was less real than apparent, and that her brother
could still keep his seat, and govern his horse, though nearly
unable to look or speak.&nbsp; She kept close to him, and was
much relieved to find that the stranger had not returned to the
sport, but was leisurely following at some distance behind the
groom.&nbsp; Never had two miles seemed so long as under her
frequent alarms lest Mervyn should become unable to keep the
saddle; but at each moment of terror, she heard the pace of the
hunter behind quickened to come to her help, and if she looked
round she met an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>When the lodge was reached, and Mervyn, somewhat revived, had
ridden through the gates, she turned back to give her warm
thanks.&nbsp; A kind, fatherly, friendly face looked at her with
a sort of compassion, as putting aside her thanks, the gentleman
said, quickly, yet half-reluctantly, &lsquo;Have you ever seen
him like this before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; the giddiness often comes on in the morning, but
never so badly as this.&nbsp; I think it was from the rapid
motion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has he had advice?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 386--><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
386</span>&lsquo;I cannot persuade him to see any one.&nbsp; Do
you think he ought?&nbsp; I would send at once, at the risk of
his being angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Dr. Martyn attend you?&nbsp; Shall I leave a
message as I go home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be most thankful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be nothing, but you will be happier that it
should be ascertained;&rsquo; and with another kindly nod, he
rode off.</p>
<p>Mervyn had gone to his room, and answered her inquiries at the
door with a brief, blunt &lsquo;better,&rsquo; to be interpreted
that he did not wish to be disturbed.&nbsp; She did not see him
till dinnertime, when he had a sullen headache, and was gruff and
gloomy.&nbsp; She tried to learn who the friend in need had been,
but he had been incapable of distinguishing anybody or anything
at the moment of the attack, and was annoyed at having been
followed.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a pottering ass to come away from a
run on a fool&rsquo;s errand!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some
Elverslope spy, who will set it about the country that I had been
drinking, and cast that up to you!&rsquo; and then he began to
rail against the ladies, singly and collectively, inconsistently
declaring it was Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s own fault for not having
called on them, and that he would have Augusta to Beauchamp, give
a ball and supper, and show whether Miss Fulmort were a person to
be cut.</p>
<p>This mode of vindication not being to Miss Fulmort&rsquo;s
taste, she tried to avert it by doubts whether Augusta could be
had; and was told that, show Lady Bannerman a bottle of
Barton&rsquo;s dry champagne, and she would come to the
world&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Meantime, Ph&oelig;be must come out
to-morrow for a round of visits, whereat her heart failed her, as
a thrusting of herself where she was not welcome; but he spoke so
fiercely and dictatorially, that she reserved her pleading for
the morning, when he would probably be too inert not to be glad
of the escape.</p>
<p>At last, Dr. Martyn&rsquo;s presence in the drawing-room was
announced to her.&nbsp; She began her explanation with desperate
bravery; and though the first words were met with a scoffing
grunt, she found Mervyn less displeased than she had
feared&mdash;nay, almost glad that the step had been taken,
though he would not say so, and made a great favour of letting
her send the physician to him in the dining-room.</p>
<p>After a time, Dr. Martyn came to tell her that he had found
her brother&rsquo;s head and pulse in such a state as to need
instant relief by cupping; and that the young Union doctor had
been sent for from the village for the purpose.&nbsp; A
constitutional fulness of blood in the head had been aggravated
by his mode of life, and immediate discipline, severe regimen,
and abstinence from business or excitement, were the only means
of averting dangerous illness; in fact, his condition might at
any time become exceedingly critical, though perseverance in care
might possibly prevent all absolute peril.&nbsp; He himself was
thoroughly frightened.&nbsp; His own sensations and forebodings
seconded the sentence too completely for resistance; it was
almost a relief to <!-- page 387--><a name="page387"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 387</span>give way; and his own method of
driving away discomfort had so signally failed, that he was
willing to resign himself to others.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be assisted at the cupping valorously and
handily.&nbsp; She had a civil speech from young Mr. Jackson, and
Mervyn, as she bade him good night, said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
spare you now, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not till you are better,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>And so she told Miss Charlecote, and wrote to Robert; but
neither was satisfied.&nbsp; Honora said it was unlucky.&nbsp; It
might certainly be a duty to nurse Mervyn if he were really ill,
and if he made himself fit company for her, but it would not set
her straight with the neighbourhood; and Robert wrote in visible
displeasure at this complication of the difficulty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If Mervyn&rsquo;s habits had disordered his health, it did
not render his pursuits more desirable for his sisters.&nbsp; If
he wanted Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s attendance, let him come to town
with her to the Bannermans; but his ailments must not be made an
excuse for detaining her in so unsuitable a position as that into
which he had brought her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not so kind a letter as Ph&oelig;be would have claimed
from Robert, and it was the more trying as Mervyn, deprived of
the factitious exhilaration that had kept him up, and lowered by
treatment, was dispirited, depressed, incapable of being
entertained, cross at her failures, yet exacting of her
attendance.&nbsp; He had business at his office in the City that
needed his presence, so he insisted till the last morning upon
going, and then owned himself in no state to go farther than the
study, where he tried to write, but found his brain so weak and
confused that he could hardly complete a letter, and was obliged
to push over even the simplest calculation to Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
In vain she tried to divert his mind from this perilous exertion;
he had not taste nor cultivation enough to be interested in
anything she could devise, and harping upon some one of the
unpleasant topics that occupied his thoughts was his only
entertainment when he grew tired of cards or backgammon.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be sat up late writing to Robert a more minute
account of Mervyn&rsquo;s illness, which she thought must plead
for him; and rather sad at heart, she had gone to bed and fallen
asleep, when far on in the night a noise startled her.&nbsp; She
did not suspect her own imagination of being to blame, except so
far as the associations with illness in the house might have
recalled the sounds that once had been wont to summon her to her
mother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; The fear that her brother might be
worse made her listen, till the sounds became matters of
certainty.&nbsp; Springing to the window, her eyes seemed to
stiffen with amaze as she beheld in the clear, full moonlight, on
the frosty sward, the distinctly-traced shadow of a horse and
cart.&nbsp; The objects themselves were concealed by a clump of
young trees, but their forms were distinctly pictured on the
turf, and the conviction flashed over her that a robbery must be
going forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perils and dangers of this night, indeed!&rsquo;&nbsp;
One prayer, one <!-- page 388--><a name="page388"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 388</span>thought.&nbsp; She remembered the
great house-bell, above the attic stairs in the opposite wing, at
the other end of the gallery, which led from the top of the grand
staircase, where the chief bedroom doors opened, and a jet of gas
burnt all night on the balustrade.&nbsp; Throwing on her
dressing-gown, she sped along the passage, and pushing open the
swing-door, beheld Mervyn at the door of his own room, and at the
head of the stairs a man, in whom she recognized the discarded
footman, raising a pistol.&nbsp; One swift bound&mdash;her hand
was on the gas-pipe.&nbsp; All was darkness, save a dim stripe
from within the open door of her mother&rsquo;s former
dressing-room, close to where she stood.&nbsp; She seized the
lock, drew it close, and had turned the key before the hand
within had time to wrench round the inner handle.&nbsp; That same
instant, the flash and report of a pistol made her cry out her
brother&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hollo! what did you put out the light for?&rsquo; he
angrily answered; and as she could just distinguish his white
shirt sleeves, she sprang to him.&nbsp; Steps went hurriedly down
the stairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone!&rsquo; they both cried at once;
Mervyn, with an imprecation on the darkness, adding, &lsquo;Go
and ring the bell.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll watch here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed, but the alarm had been given, and the house was
astir.&nbsp; Candle-light gleamed above&mdash;cries, steps, and
exclamations were heard, and she was obliged to hurry down, to
save herself from being run over.&nbsp; Two figures had joined
Mervyn, the voice of one proclaiming her as Bertha, quivering
with excitement.&nbsp; &lsquo;In there?&nbsp; My emeralds are in
there!&nbsp; Open the door, or he will make off with my&mdash;my
emeralds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Safe, my child?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand before that
door,&rsquo; cried Miss Fennimore, pulling Ph&oelig;be back with
a fond, eager grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, some of you,&rsquo; shouted Mervyn to the men,
whose heads appeared behind the herd of maids, &lsquo;come and
lay hold of the fellow when I unlock the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The women fell back with suppressed screams, and readily made
way for the men, but they shuffled, backed, and talked of
pistols, and the butler suggested the policeman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The policeman&mdash;he lives two miles off,&rsquo;
cried Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll go out of window with my
emeralds!&nbsp; Unlock the door, Mervyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unlock it yourself,&rsquo; said Mervyn, with an
impatient stamp of his foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pshaw! but thank
you,&rsquo; as Miss Fennimore put into his hand his
double-barrelled gun, the first weapon she had
found&mdash;unloaded, indeed, but even as a club formidable
enough to give him confidence to unlock the door, and call to the
man to give himself up.&nbsp; The servants huddled together like
sheep, but there was no answer.&nbsp; He called for a
light.&nbsp; It was put into his hand by Ph&oelig;be, and as he
opened the door, was blown out by a stream of cold air from the
open window.</p>
<p>The thief was gone.&nbsp; Everybody was ready to press in and
look for him in every impossible place, but he had evidently
escaped by the leads of the portico beneath; not, however, with
<!-- page 389--><a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>&lsquo;my emeralds&rsquo;&mdash;he had only attempted
the lock of the jewel cabinet.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be hurried to see whether Maria had been frightened,
and finding her happily asleep, followed the rest of the world
down-stairs, where the servants seemed to be vying with each
other in the magnitude of the losses they announced, while Mervyn
was shouting himself hoarse with passionate orders that
everything should be left alone&mdash;doors, windows,
plate-chests, and all&mdash;for the inspection of the police; and
human nature could not resist lifting up and displaying signs of
the robbery every moment, in the midst of the storm of
vituperation thus excited.</p>
<p>Mervyn could hardly attend to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s mention of
the cart, but as soon as it reached his senses, he redoubled his
hot commands to keepers and stablemen to set off in pursuit, and
called for his horse to ride to Elverslope, to give information
at the police station and telegraph office.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be
implored him to rest and send a messenger, but he roughly bade
her not to be so absurd, commanded again that nothing should be
disturbed, or, if she <i>would</i> be busy, that she should make
out a list of all that was missing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Grateful!&rsquo; indignantly thought Miss Fennimore, as
Ph&oelig;be was left leaning on a pillar in the portico, watching
him ride away, the pale light of the yellow setting moon giving
an almost ghostly appearance to her white drapery and wistful
attitude.&nbsp; Putting an arm round her, the governess found her
shivering from head to foot, and pale and cold as marble; her
knees knocked together when she walked, and her teeth chattered
as she strove to smile, but her quietness still showed itself in
all her movements, as she returned into the hall, and reached the
welcome support of a chair beside the rekindled fire.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore chafed her hands, and she looked up, smiled,
and said, &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you were frightened, after all,
Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; cried Bertha, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was I?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, as in a dream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, when you don&rsquo;t know what you are talking
of, and are still trembling all over?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; I think what came on me then
was thankfulness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure we may be thankful that our jewels are the
only things safe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Bertha, you don&rsquo;t know, then, that the man
was taking aim at Mervyn!&rsquo; and the shudder returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, Ph&oelig;be, for the sake of candour and
psychology, confess your terror.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Bertha,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with a smile
on her tremulous lip, &lsquo;it is very odd, but I don&rsquo;t
think I was afraid; there was a feeling of shadowing Wings that
left no room for terror.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That enabled you to think and act?&rsquo; asked Miss
Fennimore.</p>
<p><!-- page 390--><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think; it came to me,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray, let me go; Bertha dear, you had
better go to bed.&nbsp; Pray lie down, Miss Fennimore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She moved slowly away, her steps still unsteady and her cheeks
colourless, but the sweet light of thankfulness on her face;
while Bertha said, in her moralizing tone, &lsquo;It is a curious
study to see Ph&oelig;be taking her own steady nerves and power
of resource for something external to herself, and being pious
about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore was not gratified by her apt pupil&rsquo;s
remark.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s conduct do not fill
you with reverence, both for her and that which actuates her, I
can only stand astonished,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Bertha turned away, and erected her eyebrows.</p>
<p>No one could go to bed, and before five o&rsquo;clock
Ph&oelig;be came down, dressed for the day, and set to work with
the butler and the inventory of the plate to draw up an account
of the losses.&nbsp; Not merely the plate in common use was gone,
but the costly services and ornaments that had been the glory of
old Mr. Fulmort&rsquo;s heart; and the locks had not been broken
but opened with a key; the drawing-rooms had been rifled of their
expensive bijouterie, and the foray would have been completely
successful had it included the jewels.&nbsp; There were no marks
of a violent entrance; windows and doors were all fastened as
usual, with the single exception of the back door, which was
found ajar, but with no traces of having been opened in an
unusual manner, though the heavy bolts and bars would have
precluded an entrance from the outside even with a false key.</p>
<p>Early in the day, Mervyn returned with the superintendent of
police.&nbsp; He was still too much excited to rest, and his
heavy tread re-echoed from floor to floor, as he showed the
superintendent round the house, calling his sister or the
servants to corroborate his statements, or help out his account
of what he had hardly seen or comprehended.&nbsp; Thus he came to
Ph&oelig;be for her version of the affair in the gallery, of
which he only knew his own share&mdash;the noise that had roused
him, the sight of the burglar, the sudden darkness, the report of
the pistol; and the witness of his danger&mdash;the
bullet&mdash;was in the wall nearly where his head had
been.&nbsp; When Ph&oelig;be had answered his questions, he gazed
at her, and exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Hallo! why, Ph&oelig;be, it
seems that but for you, Parson Robert would be in possession
here!&rsquo; and burst into a strange nervous laugh, ending by
coming to her and giving a hearty kiss to her forehead, ere
hurrying away to report her evidence to the policeman.</p>
<p>When all measures had been taken, intelligence sent back to
the station, and a search instituted in every direction, Mervyn
consented to sit down to breakfast, but talked instead of eating,
telling Ph&oelig;be that even without her recognition of James
Smithson, the former footman, the superintendent would have
attributed the burglary to a person familiar with the house, <!--
page 391--><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>provided with facsimiles of all the keys, except those
of the jewels, as well as sufficiently aware of the habits of the
family to make the attempt just before the jewels were to be
removed, and when the master was likely to be absent.&nbsp; The
appearance of the back door had led to the conclusion that the
thieves had been admitted from within; a London detective had
therefore been sent for, who was to come in the guise of a clerk
from the distillery, bringing down the books to Mr. Fulmort, and
Ph&oelig;be was forbidden to reveal his true character to any one
but Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; So virulently did Mervyn talk of
Smithson, that Ph&oelig;be was sorry she had recognized him, and
became first compassionate, then disconcerted and shocked.&nbsp;
She rose to leave the room as the only means of silencing him; he
got up to come after her, abusing the law because house-breaking
was not a hanging matter, his face growing more purple with
passion every moment; but his steps suddenly failed, his
exclamation transferred his fury to his own giddiness, and
Ph&oelig;be, flying to his side, was only just in time to support
him to a couch.&nbsp; It was the worst attack he had yet had, and
his doctors coming in the midst of it, used prompt measures to
relieve him, and impressed on both him and his sister that
everything would depend on perfect quiet and absence from all
disturbance; and he was so much exhausted by the reaction of his
excitement, loss of blood, and confusion of head, that he
attempted little but long fretful sighs when at length he was
left to her.&nbsp; After much weariness and discomfort he fell
asleep, and Ph&oelig;be ventured to creep quietly out of the
library to see Miss Charlecote, who was hearing the night&rsquo;s
adventures in the schoolroom.&nbsp; Scarcely, however, had Honor
had time to embrace the little heroine, whose conduct had lost
nothing in Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s narration, when a message came
from Elverslope.&nbsp; It was the day of the petty sessions, and
a notable bad character having been taken up with some suspicious
articles upon him, the magistrates were waiting for Mr. Fulmort
to make out the committal on his evidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go instead,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, after
considering for a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; exclaimed Honor, &lsquo;you do not know
how unpleasant it will be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn must sleep,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;and
if this be an innocent man, he ought to be cleared at once.&nbsp;
If it be not improper, I think I ought to go.&nbsp; May I?&rsquo;
looking at the governess, who suggested her speaking to the
superintendent, and learning whether her brother had been
absolutely summoned.</p>
<p>It proved to be only a verbal message, and the superintendent
urged her going, telling her that her evidence would suffice for
the present, and that she would be the most important witness at
the assizes&mdash;which he evidently considered as a great
compliment.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote undertook to go and take care of her young
<!-- page 392--><a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
392</span>friend, and they set off in silence, Ph&oelig;be
leaning back with her veil down, and Honor, perceiving that she
needed this interval of quiet repose, watching her with
wonder.&nbsp; Had it been Honor&rsquo;s own case, she would have
hung back out of dislike to pursuing an enemy, and from dread of
publicity, but these objections had apparently not occurred to
the more simple mind, only devising how to spare her brother; and
while Honor would have been wretched from distrust of her own
accuracy, and her habits of imperfect observation would have made
her doubt her own senses and memory, she honoured
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s careful training in seeing what she saw, and
hearing what she heard, without cross lights or counter sounds
from imagination.&nbsp; Once Ph&oelig;be inquired in a low,
awe-struck voice, &lsquo;Shall I be put on oath?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most likely, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s hands were pressed together as though in
preparation for a religious rite.&nbsp; She was not dismayed, but
from her strict truth at all times, she was the more sensible of
the sacredness and solemnity of the great appeal.</p>
<p>An offence on so large a scale had brought a throng of
loiterers to the door of the town-hall, and Honor felt nervous
and out of place as way was made for the two ladies to mount the
stairs to the justice-room; but there she was welcomed by several
of the magistrates, and could watch Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
demeanour, and the impression it made on persons accustomed to
connect many strange stories with the name of Miss Fulmort.&nbsp;
That air of maidenly innocence, the girlish form in deep
mourning, the gentle seriousness and grave composure of the young
face, the simple, self-possessed manner, and the steady, distinct
tones of the clear, soft voice were, as Honor felt, producing an
effect that was shown in the mood of addressing her, always
considerate and courteous, but increasing in respect and
confidence.</p>
<p>And as Ph&oelig;be raised her eyes, the chairman&rsquo;s
face&mdash;the first to meet her glance&mdash;was the kind ruddy
one, set in iron gray hair, that she remembered as belonging to
the hunter who had sacrificed the run to see Mervyn safely
home.&nbsp; The mutual recognition, and the tone of concern for
his illness, made her feel in the presence of a friend, and she
was the more at ease in performing her part.</p>
<p>To her great relief, the man in custody was unknown to
her.&nbsp; James Smithson, she said, was taller, and had a longer
face, and she had not seen him whom she had locked into the
dressing-room.&nbsp; However, she identified a gold and turquoise
letter-weight; and the setting of a seal, whence the stone with
the crest had been extracted, both of which had been found in the
man&rsquo;s pocket, together with some pawnbroker&rsquo;s
tickets, which represented a buhl-clock and other articles from
Beauchamp.&nbsp; She was made to give an account of the
robbery.&nbsp; Honor had never felt prouder of any of her
favourites than of her, while listening to the modest, simple,
but clear and circumstantial recital, and watching how much
struck the country gentlemen <!-- page 393--><a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>were by the
girl who had been of late everywhere pitied or censured.</p>
<p>The statement over, she was desired to answer a few questions
from Captain Morden, the chief of the constabulary force, who had
come from the county town to investigate the affair.&nbsp; Taking
her aside, he minutely examined her on the appearance of some of
the articles mentioned in the inventory, on the form of the
shadow of the horse and cart, on the thieves themselves, and
chiefly on Smithson, and how she could be so secure of the
identity of the robber in the pea-jacket with the footman in
powder and livery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hardly tell,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but
I have no doubt in my own mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was he like this?&rsquo; asked Captain Morden, showing
her a photograph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that is Smithson in plain clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right, Miss Fulmort.&nbsp; You have an eye for a
likeness.&nbsp; These fellows have such a turn for having their
portraits done, that in these affairs we always try if the
shilling photographers have duplicates.&nbsp; This will be sent
to town by the next train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that I should have known it if I had not
seen it before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Should you object to tell me under what
circumstances?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the photographer&rsquo;s, at the time he was at
Hiltonbury,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I went to him
with one of my sisters, and we were amused by finding many of the
likenesses of our servants.&nbsp; Smithson and another came in to
be taken while we were there, and we afterwards saw this portrait
when calling for my sister&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another&mdash;another servant?&rsquo; said the keen
captain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, one of the maids.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her name, if you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, distressed, as she saw
this jotted down.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot bring suspicion and
trouble on any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will do no such thing, Miss Fulmort.&nbsp; We will
only keep our eye on her.&nbsp; Neither she, nor any one else,
shall have any ground for supposing her under suspicion, but it
is our duty to miss no possible indication.&nbsp; Will you oblige
me with her name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is called Jane, but I do not know her real
name,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with much reluctance, and in
little need of the injunction to secrecy on this head.&nbsp; The
general eagerness to hunt down the criminals saddened her, and
she was glad to be released, with thanks for her distinct
evidence.&nbsp; The kind old chairman then met her, quite with an
air of fatherly protection, such as elderly men often wear
towards orphaned maidens, and <!-- page 394--><a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>inquired
more particularly for her brother&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; She was
glad to thank him again for having sent the physician, when his
aid was so needful, and she was in so much difficulty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A bold stroke,&rsquo; he, said, smiling; &lsquo;I thought
you might throw all the blame on me if it were
needless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Needless&mdash;oh! it may have saved him.&nbsp; Is that
the carriage?&nbsp; I must get home as soon as I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am sure you must be anxious, but I hope to see
more of you another time.&nbsp; Lady Raymond must come and see if
you cannot find a day to spend with my girls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Raymond!&nbsp; So this was Sir John! Mervyn&rsquo;s foe
and maligner!&nbsp; Was he repenting at the sight of what he had
done?&nbsp; Yet he really looked like a very good, kind old man,
and seemed satisfied with the very shabby answer he obtained to a
speech that filled Honor with a sense of her young friend&rsquo;s
victory.&nbsp; There was Ph&oelig;be, re-established in the good
graces of the neighbourhood, favoured by the very
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of the county for goodness, sought by those
who had never visited at Beauchamp in the days of its gaiety and
ostentation!&nbsp; Ungrateful child, not to be better
pleased&mdash;only saying that she supposed she should go away
when her brother should be well again, and not seeing her way to
any day for Moorcroft!&nbsp; Was she still unforgiving for
Mervyn&rsquo;s rejection, or had she a feeling against visiting
those who had not taken notice of her family before?</p>
<p>Mervyn met Ph&oelig;be in the hall, still looking very ill,
with his purple paleness, his heavy eyes, and uncertain steps,
and though he called himself all right, since his sleep, it was
with a weary gasp that he sank into his chair, and called on her
for an account of what she had done.&nbsp; His excitement seemed
to have burnt itself out, for he listened languidly, and asked
questions by jerks, dozing half-way through the answer, and
wakening to some fresh inquiry; once it was&mdash;&lsquo;And did
the old sinner take any notice of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The prisoner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense.&nbsp; Old Raymond.&nbsp; Of course he was in
the chair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was very kind.&nbsp; It was he who came home from
the hunt with us the other day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! I said it was some old woman of a spy, wanting to
get up a story against me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I think he felt kindly, for he talked of Lady
Raymond calling, and my spending a day at Moorcroft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! so the godly mean to rescue you, do
they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not accept.&nbsp; Perhaps they will never think
of it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; his ladies will not let him!&rsquo; sneered
Mervyn.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his last words that night were, &lsquo;So the
Raymonds have asked you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was in a more satisfactory state the next day; feeble, but
tamed into endurance of medical treatment, and almost indifferent
about the robbery; as though his passion were spent, and he were
tired of the subject.&nbsp; However, the police were <!-- page
395--><a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
395</span>alert.&nbsp; The man whom they had taken up was a
squatter in the forest, notorious as a poacher and thief, and his
horse and cart answered to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s description of the
shadow.&nbsp; He had been arrested when returning with them from
the small seaport on the other side of the forest in the next
county, and on communicating with the authorities there, search
at a dealer&rsquo;s in marine stores had revealed hampers filled
with the Beauchamp plate, as yet unmelted.&nbsp; The spoils of
lesser bulk had disappeared with Smithson and the other
criminal.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The detective arrived, looking so entirely the office clerk as
to take in Mervyn himself at first sight; and the rest of the
world understood that he was to stay till their master could go
over the accounts with him.&nbsp; As housekeeper&rsquo;s room
company, his attentions were doubly relished by the housemaids,
and jealousy was not long in prompting the revelation that Jane
Hart had been Smithson&rsquo;s sweetheart, and was supposed to
have met him since his dismissal.&nbsp; Following up this trail,
the detective proved to his own satisfaction that she had been at
a ball at a public-house in the next village the night before the
hunt, and had there met both Smithson and the poacher.&nbsp;
This, however, he reserved for Mervyn&rsquo;s private ear, still
watching his victim, in the hope that she might unconsciously
give some clue to the whereabouts of her lover.&nbsp; The
espionage diverted Mervyn, and gave him the occupation for his
thoughts that he sorely needed; but it oppressed Ph&oelig;be, and
she shrank from the sight of the housemaid, as though she herself
were dealing treacherously by her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Mervyn, mysteriously, coming
into the library, where his tardy breakfast was spread,
&lsquo;that villain Smithson has been taken up at Liverpool; and
here&rsquo;s a letter for you to look at.&nbsp; Fenton has
captured a letter to that woman Hart, who, he found, was always
wanting to go to the post&mdash;but he can&rsquo;t make it out;
and I thought it was German, so I brought it to you.&nbsp; It
looks as if old Lieschen&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! no! it can&rsquo;t be,&rsquo; cried
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll clear it up in a
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But as she glanced at the letter the colour fled from her
cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo; said Mervyn, impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mervyn!&rsquo; and she put her hands before her
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, the fewer words the better.&nbsp; Out with it at
once!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>&lsquo;Mervyn!&nbsp; It is to Bertha!&rsquo;&nbsp; She
stood transfixed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Bertha,&rsquo; repeated Ph&oelig;be, looking as if
she could never shut her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha?&nbsp; What, a billet-doux; the little
precocious pussycat!&rsquo; and he laughed, to
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s increased horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it could only be a mistake!&rsquo; said she;
&lsquo;but here is her name!&nbsp; It is not German, only English
in German writing.&nbsp; Oh, Bertha! Bertha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but who is the fellow?&nbsp; Let me look,&rsquo;
said Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too foolish,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, guarding
it, in the midst of her cold chills of dismay.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
is no surname&mdash;only John.&nbsp; Ah! here&rsquo;s J. H.&nbsp;
Oh! Mervyn, could it be Mr. Hastings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No such thing!&nbsp; John!&nbsp; Why, my name&rsquo;s
John&mdash;everybody&rsquo;s name is John!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mervyn, I was warned,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, her
eyes again dilating with dismay, &lsquo;that Mr. Hastings never
was received into a house with women without there being cause to
repent it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Experience might have taught you how much slanderous
gossip to believe by this time!&nbsp; I believe it is some
trumpery curate she has been meeting at Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
school feasts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Mervyn,&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, in real
anger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Curates like thirty thousand as much as other
men,&rsquo; said Mervyn, sulkily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, controlling
herself, &lsquo;what signifies most is, that poor Bertha should
have been led to do such a dreadful thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If ever I take charge of a pack of women again!&nbsp;
But let&rsquo;s hear what the rascal says to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think it is fair to read it all,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, glancing over the tender passages.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor
child, how ashamed she will be!&nbsp; But listen&mdash;&rsquo;
and she read a portion, as if meant to restrain the girl&rsquo;s
impatience, promising to offer a visit to Beauchamp, or, if that
were refused till the captives were carried off, assuring her
there would be ways and means at Acton Manor, where a little
coldness from the baronet always secured the lady&rsquo;s good
graces.</p>
<p>Acton Manor was in Mr. Hastings&rsquo; neighbourhood, and
Mervyn struck his own knee several times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hum! ha!&nbsp; Was not some chaff going on one day
about the heiresses boxed up in the west wing?&nbsp; Some one set
you all down at a monstrous figure&mdash;a hundred thousand
apiece.&nbsp; I wonder if he were green enough to believe
it!&nbsp; Hastings!&nbsp; No, it can&rsquo;t be!&nbsp; Here,
we&rsquo;ll have the impudent child down, and frighten it out of
her.&nbsp; But first, how are we to put off that fellow
Fenton?&nbsp; Make up something to tell him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Making up would be of no use,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;he is too clever.&nbsp; Tell him it is a family
matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn left the room, and Ph&oelig;be hid her face in her
hands, thunderstruck, and endeavouring to disentangle her
thoughts, <!-- page 397--><a name="page397"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 397</span>perturbed between shame,
indignation, and the longing to shield and protect her
sister.&nbsp; She had not fully realized her sister&rsquo;s
offence, so new to her imagination, when she was roused by
Mervyn&rsquo;s return, saying that he had sent for Bertha to have
it over.</p>
<p>Starting up, she begged to go and prepare her sister, but he
peremptorily detained her, and, &lsquo;Oh, be kind to her,&rsquo;
was all that she could say, before in tripped Bertha, looking
restless and amazed, but her <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> nose, round
features, and wavy hair so childish that the accusation seemed
absurd.</p>
<p>So Mervyn felt it, and in vain drew in his feet, made himself
upright, and tried to look magisterial.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bertha,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;Bertha, I have sent for
you, Bertha&mdash;it is not possible&mdash;What&rsquo;s
that?&rsquo; pointing to the letter, as though it had been a
stain of ink which she had just perpetrated.</p>
<p>Alarmed perhaps, but certainly not confounded, Bertha put her
hands before her, and demurely said&mdash;&lsquo;What do you
mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, Bertha, by such a correspondence as
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you know that letter is for me, why did you meddle
with it?&rsquo; she coolly answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, this is assurance,&rsquo; cried
Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me my letter,&rsquo; repeated Bertha, reaching out
for it.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one else has a right to touch
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there be nothing amiss,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
coming to the relief of her brother, who was almost speechless at
this audacity, &lsquo;why receive it under cover to a
servant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because prejudice surrounds me,&rsquo; stoutly replied
Bertha, with barely a hitch in her speech, as if making a grand
stroke; but seeing her brother smile, she added in an
annihilating tone, &lsquo;practical tyranny is exercised in every
family until education and intellect effect a moral
emancipation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Mervyn, &lsquo;education teaching you
to write letters in German hand!&nbsp; Fine results!&nbsp; I tell
you, if you were older, the disgrace of this would stick to you
for life, but if you will tell the whole truth about this
scoundrel, and put an end to it, we will do the best we can for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made up a disdainful mouth, and said, &lsquo;Thank
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said Mervyn, turning to Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;it is a joke!&nbsp; Look at her!&nbsp; She is a
baby!&nbsp; You need not have made such a rout.&nbsp; This is
only a toy-letter to a little girl; very good practice in German
writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am engaged to John Hastings heart and hand,&rsquo;
said Bertha in high dignity, little knowing that she thus first
disclosed the name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, people talk of children being their little
wives,&rsquo; said Mervyn, &lsquo;but you are getting too old for
such nonsense, though he does not think you so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the joint purpose of our lives,&rsquo; said
Bertha.</p>
<p>Mervyn gave his scoffing laugh, and again addressing
Ph&oelig;be, <!-- page 398--><a name="page398"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 398</span>said, &lsquo;If it were you, now, or
any one with whom he was not in sport, it would be a serious
matter.&nbsp; The fellow got himself expelled from Harrow, then
was the proverb of even a German university, ran through his
means before he was five-and-twenty, is as much at home in the
Queen&rsquo;s Bench as I am in this study, has been outlawed,
lived on <i>rouge et noir</i> at Baden till he got whitewashed
when his mother died, and since that has lived on betting, or
making himself agreeable to whoever would ask him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many thanks on the part of your intimate friend,&rsquo;
said Bertha, with suppressed passion.</p>
<p>Mervyn stamped his foot, and Ph&oelig;be defended him with,
&lsquo;Men may associate with those who are no companions for
their sisters, Bertha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Contracted minds always accept malignant
reports,&rsquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Report,&rsquo; said Mervyn; &lsquo;I know it as well as
I know myself!&rsquo; then recollecting himself, &lsquo;but she
does not understand, it is of no use to talk to children.&nbsp;
Take her away, Ph&oelig;be, and keep her in the nursery till Mr.
Crabbe comes to settle what is to be done with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I insist on having my letter,&rsquo; said Bertha, with
womanly grandeur.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let her have it.&nbsp; It is not worth bothering about
a mere joke,&rsquo; said Mervyn, leaning back, wearied of the
struggle, in which, provoking as he was, he had received some
home thrusts.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be felt bewildered, and as if she had a perfect
stranger on her hands, though Bertha&rsquo;s high tone was, after
all, chiefly from her extremity, and by way of reply to her
brother&rsquo;s scornful incredulity of her exalted
position.&nbsp; She was the first to speak on leaving the
library.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray, Ph&oelig;be, how came you to tamper
with people&rsquo;s letters?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be explained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Mervyn and his spy one could expect no
delicacy,&rsquo; said Bertha, &lsquo;but in you it was
treachery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Bertha,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;I was
grieved to expose you, but it was my duty to clear the innocent
by examining the letter, and Mervyn had a right to know what
concerned you when you were under his charge.&nbsp; It is our
business to save you, and a letter sent in this way does not
stand on the same ground as one coming openly under your own
name.&nbsp; But I did not read it to him, Bertha&mdash;not
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had,&rsquo; said Bertha, more piqued than
obliged by this reserve, &lsquo;he would have known it was in
earnest and not childish nonsense.&nbsp; You saw that it was
earnest, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; and her defiant voice betrayed a
semi-distrust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid it looked very much so,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but, Bertha, that would be saddest of
all.&nbsp; I am afraid he might be wicked enough to be trying to
get your fortune, for indeed&mdash;don&rsquo;t be very much
vexed, dearest, I am only saying it for your <!-- page 399--><a
name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>good&mdash;you are not old enough, nor formed, nor
pretty enough, really to please a man that has seen so much of
the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He never met so fresh, or original, or so highly
cultivated a mind,&rsquo; said Bertha; &lsquo;besides, as to
features, there may be different opinions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Bertha, how could you ever see him or speak to
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hearts can find more ways than you dream of,&rsquo;
said Bertha, with a touch of sentiment; &lsquo;we had only to
meet for the magnetism of mind to be felt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Argument was heartless work.&nbsp; Flattery and the glory of
her conquest had entirely filled the child&rsquo;s mind, and she
despised Mervyn and Ph&oelig;be far too much for the
representations of the one or the persuasions of the other to
have the smallest weight with her.&nbsp; Evidently, weariness of
her studies, and impatience of discipline had led her to lend a
willing ear to any distraction, and to give in to the intercourse
that both gratified and amused herself and outwitted her
governess, and thence the belief in the power of her own charms,
and preference for their admirer, were steps easier than appeared
credible to Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; From listening in helpless amaze
to a miserable round of pertness and philosophy, Ph&oelig;be was
called down-stairs to hear that Mervyn had been examining Jane
Hart, and had elicited from her that after having once surprised
Mr. Hastings and Miss Bertha in conversation, she had several
times conveyed notes between them, and since he had left
Beauchamp, she had posted two letters to him from the young lady,
but this was the first answer received, directed to herself, to
be left at the post-office to be called for.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earnest enough on his part,&rsquo; said Mervyn;
&lsquo;a regular speculation to patch up his fortunes.&nbsp;
Well, I knew enough of him, as I told you, but I was fool enough
to pity him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He became silent, and so did Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; She had been
too much overset to look the subject fairly in the face, and his
very calmness of voice and the absence of abusive epithets were a
token that he was perfectly appalled at what he had brought on
his sisters.&nbsp; They both sat still some minutes, when she saw
him lean back with his hand to his head, and his eyes
closed.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a steeple chase!&rsquo; he
said, as Ph&oelig;be laid her cool hand on his burning brow, and
felt the throbbing of the swollen veins of his temples.&nbsp;
Both knew that this meant cupping, and they sent in haste for the
Hiltonbury doctor, but he was out for the day, and would not
return till evening.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be felt dull and stunned, as
if her decision had caused all the mischief, and more and more
were following on, and her spirit almost died within her at
Mervyn&rsquo;s interjection of rage and suffering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though they curse, yet bless thou,&rsquo; had of
necessity been her rule while clinging to this brother; a mental
ejaculation had become habitual, and this time it brought
reaction from her forlorn despondency.&nbsp; She could do
something.&nbsp; Twice she had assisted in cupping, and she
believed she could perform the <!-- page 400--><a
name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>operation.&nbsp; No failure could be as hurtful as
delay, and she offered to make the attempt.&nbsp; Mervyn growled
at her folly, yawned, groaned, looked at his watch, counted the
heavy hours, and supposed she must do as she chose.</p>
<p>Her heart rivalled his temples in palpitation, but happily
without affecting eye, voice, or hand, and with Lieschen&rsquo;s
help the deed was successfully done, almost with equal benefit to
the operator and the patient.</p>
<p>Success had put new life into her; the troubles had been
forgotten for the moment, and recurred not as a shameful burthen,
caused by her own imprudence, but as a possible turning-point, a
subject for action, not for despair, and Ph&oelig;be was herself
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you are writing?&rsquo; asked Mervyn,
starting from a doze on the sofa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A letter to Robert,&rsquo; she answered
reluctantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you will put it in the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; No
woman can keep a thing to herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would tell no one else, but I wanted his
advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I dare say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be saw that to persist in her letter would utterly
destroy the repose that was essential in Mervyn&rsquo;s state,
and she laid aside her pen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going to do it out of sight?&rsquo; he petulantly
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but at any rate I will wait till Miss Fennimore has
talked to Bertha.&nbsp; She will be more willing to listen to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because this is the result of her emancipating
education.&nbsp; Ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but Bertha will attend to her, and cannot say her
notions are servile and contracted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you say any more, I shall get up and flog them
both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fennimore is very wise,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what has she taught you but the ologies and the
Rights of Women?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The chief thing she teaches,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;is to attend to what we are doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn laughed, but did not perceive how those words were the
key of Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir John and Lady Raymond and Miss Raymond in the
drawing-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unappreciating the benefit of changing the current of thought,
Ph&oelig;be lamented their admission, and moved reluctantly to
the great rooms, where the guests looked as if they belonged to a
more easy and friendly region than to that world of mirrors,
damask, and gilding.</p>
<p>Sir John shook hands like an old friend, but his wife was one
of those homely ladies who never appear to advantage in strange
houses, and Ph&oelig;be had not learnt the art of &lsquo;lady of
the house&rsquo; talk, besides feeling a certain chilliness
towards Mervyn&rsquo;s detractors, which rendered her stiff and
formal.&nbsp; To her amaze, <!-- page 401--><a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>however,
the languishing talk was interrupted by his entrance; he who
regarded Sir John as the cause of his disappointment; he who had
last met Susan Raymond at the time of his rejection; he whom she
had left prostrate among the sofa cushions; he had absolutely
exerted himself to brush his hair and put on coat and boots, yet
how horribly ill and nervous he looked, totally devoid of his
usual cool assurance, uncertain whether to shake hands with the
two ladies, and showing a strange restless eagerness as though
entirely shaken off his balance.</p>
<p>Matters were mended by his entrance.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be liked
Lady Raymond from the moment she detected a sign to the vehement
Sir John not to keep his host standing during the discussion of
the robbery, and she ventured on expressing her gratitude for his
escort on the day of the hunt.&nbsp; Then arose an entreaty to
view the scene of the midnight adventure, and the guests were
conducted to the gallery, shown where each party had stood, the
gas-pipe, the mark of the pistol-shot, and the door was opened to
display the cabinet, and the window of the escape.&nbsp; To the
intense surprise of her brother and sister, Bertha was examining
her emeralds.</p>
<p>She came forward quite at her ease, and if she had been ten
years a woman could not more naturally have assumed the
entertainment of Lady Raymond, talking so readily that
Ph&oelig;be would have believed the morning&rsquo;s transactions
a delusion, but for Mervyn&rsquo;s telegraph of astonishment.</p>
<p>The visitors had been at the Holt, and obtained a promise from
Miss Charlecote to spend the ensuing Saturday week at
Moorcroft.&nbsp; They begged the sisters to accompany her.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be drew back, though Mervyn hurried out declarations of
his not wanting her, and the others never going out, till she
hardly knew how it had been decided; but as the guests departed
she heard Mervyn severely observing to Bertha&mdash;&lsquo;no,
certainly I should not send you to keep company with any
well-behaved young ladies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I have no desire to associate with
commonplace girls,&rsquo; said Bertha, marching off to the west
wing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will go, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, if I did it would be partly for the sake of
giving change to Bertha, and letting her see what nice people
really are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you crazy, Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; I would not have
Bertha with her impudence and her pedantry go among the
Raymonds&mdash;no, not for the Bank of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those words darted into Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s mind the
perception why Mervyn was, in his strange way, promoting her
intercourse with Moorcroft, not only as stamping her conduct with
approval of people of their worth and weight, but as affording
him some slight glimmering of hope.&nbsp; She could not but
recollect that the extra recklessness of language which had
pained her, ever since his rejection had diminished ever since
her report of Sir John&rsquo;s notice of her at the justice
room.&nbsp; Sister-like, she pitied <!-- page 402--><a
name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>and hoped;
but the more immediate care extinguished all the rest, and she
was longing for Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s sympathy, though grieving
at the pain the disclosure must inflict.&nbsp; It could not be
made till the girls were gone to bed, and at half-past nine,
Ph&oelig;be sought the schoolroom, and told her tale.&nbsp; There
was no answer, but an almost convulsive shudder; her hand was
seized, and her finger guided to the line which Miss Fennimore
had been reading in the Greek Testament&mdash;&lsquo;By their
fruits ye shall know them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rallying before Ph&oelig;be could trace what was passing in
her mind, she shut the book, turned her chair to the fire,
invited Ph&oelig;be to another, and was at once the clear-headed,
metaphysical governess, ready to discuss this grievous
marvel.&nbsp; She was too generous by nature not to have treated
her pupils with implicit trust, and this trust had been
abused.&nbsp; Looking back, she and Ph&oelig;be could recollect
moments when Bertha had been unaccounted for, and must have held
interviews with Mr. Hastings.&nbsp; She had professed a turn for
twilight walks in the garden, and remained out of doors when the
autumn evenings had sent the others in, and on the Sunday
afternoons, when Ph&oelig;be and Maria had been at church, Miss
Fennimore reproached herself exceedingly with having been too
much absorbed in her own readings to concern herself about the
proceedings of a pupil, whose time on that day was at her own
disposal.&nbsp; She also thought that there had been
communications by look and sign across the pew at church; and she
had remarked, though Ph&oelig;be had been too much occupied with
her brother to perceive the restlessness that had settled on
Bertha from the time of the departure of Mervyn&rsquo;s guests,
and had once reproved her for lingering, as she thought, to
gossip with Jane Hart in her bedroom.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
now,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, &lsquo;she should have a
thorough change.&nbsp; Send her to school, calling it punishment,
if you please, but chiefly for the sake of placing her among
laughing girlish girls of the same age, and, above all, under a
thoroughly religious mistress of wide intelligence, and who has
never doubted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we were all to keep together, dear Miss
Fennimore&mdash;you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One whose mind has always been balancing between
aspects of truth may instruct, but cannot educate.&nbsp; Few
minds can embrace the moral virtues unless they are based on an
undoubted foundation, connected with present devotional warmth,
and future hopes and fears.&nbsp; I see this now; I once thought
excellence would approve itself, for its own sake, to others, as
it did to myself.&nbsp; I regarded Bertha as a fair subject for a
full experiment of my system, with good disposition, good
abilities, and few counter influences.&nbsp; I meant to cultivate
self-relying, unprejudiced, effective good sense, and
see&mdash;with prejudices have been rooted up
restraints!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Education seems to me to have little to do with what
people <!-- page 403--><a name="page403"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 403</span>turn out,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at poor Miss Charlecote and the
Sandbrooks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Depend upon it, Ph&oelig;be, that whatever harm may
have ensued from her errors in detail, those young people will
yet bless her for the principle she worked on.&nbsp; You can none
of you bless me, for having guided the hands of the watch, and
having left the mainspring untouched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore had been, like Helvetius and the better class
of encyclop&aelig;dists, enamoured of the moral virtues, but
unable to perceive that they could not be separated from the
Christian faith, and she learnt like them that, when doctrine
ceased to be prominent, practice went after it.&nbsp; Bertha was
her Jacobin&mdash;and seemed doubly so the next morning, when an
interview took place, in which the young lady gave her to
understand that she, like Ph&oelig;be, was devoid of the
experience that would enable them to comprehend the sacred mutual
duty of souls that once had spoken.&nbsp; Woman was no longer the
captive of the seraglio, nor the chronicler of small beer.&nbsp;
Intellectual training conferred rights of choice superior to
conventional ties; and, as to the infallible discernment of that
fifteen year old judgment, had not she the sole premises to go
upon, she who alone had been admitted to the innermost of that
manly existence?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always knew Jack to be a clever dog,&rsquo; said
Mervyn, when this was reported to him, &lsquo;but his soft sawder
to a priggish metaphysical baby must have been the best fun in
the world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn&rsquo;s great desire was to keep Bertha&rsquo;s folly
as great a secret as possible; and, by his decision, she was told
that grace should be granted her till Mr. Crabbe&rsquo;s arrival,
when, unless she had renounced what he called her silly
child&rsquo;s fancy, stringent measures would be taken, and she
would be exposed to the family censure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So,&rsquo; said Bertha, &lsquo;you expect to destroy
the attraction of souls by physical force!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Ph&oelig;be wrote to Robert a sorrowful letter, chiefly
consisting of the utmost pleadings for Mervyn and Bertha that her
loving heart could frame.&nbsp; She was happier when she had
poured out her troubles, but grieved when no answer came by the
next post.&nbsp; Robert&rsquo;s displeasure must be
great&mdash;and indeed but too justly so&mdash;since all this
mischief was the consequence of the disregard of his
wishes.&nbsp; Yet justice was hard between brothers and sisters,
especially when Mervyn was in such a suffering state, threatened
constantly by attacks of his complaint, which were only warded
off by severe and weakening treatment.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be was so
necessary to his comfort in waiting on him, and trying to while
away his tedious hours of inaction and oppression, that she had
little time to bestow upon Bertha, nor, indeed, was talking of
any use, as it only gave the young lady an occasion for pouring
forth magniloquent sentiments, utterly heedless of the
answers.&nbsp; Sad, lonely, and helpless were <!-- page 404--><a
name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
404</span>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s feelings, but she was patient, and
still went on step by step through the strange tangle, attending
to Mervyn hour by hour, always with a gentle cheerful word and
smile, and never trusting herself, even when alone, to think of
the turmoil and break up that must ensue on her guardian&rsquo;s
arrival.</p>
<p>All was darkness and perplexity before her, but submission and
trust were her refuge, and each day of waiting before the crisis
was to her feelings a gain.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mervyn and Ph&oelig;be were playing at billiards, as a means
of inducing him to take exercise enough to make him sleep.&nbsp;
The governess and the two girls were gone to the dentist&rsquo;s
at Elverslope.&nbsp; The winter&rsquo;s day was closing in, when
there was a knock at the door, and they beheld Miss Fennimore,
deadly white, and Maria, who flew up to Ph&oelig;be,
crying&mdash;&lsquo;Bertha&rsquo;s gone, Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next up-train stops at Elverslope at 8.30,&rsquo;
said the governess, staring in Mervyn&rsquo;s face, as though
repeating a lesson.&nbsp; &lsquo;A carriage will be here by
seven.&nbsp; I will bring her home, or never return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was inexcusable in me, sir,&rsquo; said Miss
Fennimore, resting a hand on the table to support herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought it needlessly galling to let her feel herself
watched; and at her request, let her remain in the waiting-room
while her sister was in the dentist&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; When,
after an hour, Maria was released, she was gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alone?&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alone, I hope.&nbsp; I went to the station; the train
had been ten minutes gone; but a young lady, alone, in mourning,
and with no luggage but a little bag, had got in there for
London.&nbsp; Happily, they did not know her; and it was the
parliamentary train, which is five hours on the road.&nbsp; I
telegraphed at once to your brother to meet her at the
terminus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no hope,&rsquo; said Mervyn, doggedly, seating
himself on the table, his feet dangling.&nbsp; &lsquo;He will be
in the lowest gutter of Whittingtonia, where no one can find
him.&nbsp; The fellow will meet that miserable child, go off to
Ostend this very night, marry her before to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s an end of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where does Mr. Hastings lodge, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span>&lsquo;Nowhere that I know of.&nbsp; There will be no
end of time lost in tracing him!&nbsp; No train before
8.30!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go in at once, and have a
special.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They cannot put on one before nine, because of the
excursion trains for the cattle-show.&nbsp; I should not have
been in time had I driven to catch the express at W.,&rsquo; said
Miss Fennimore, in her clear voice of desperation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The 8.30 reaches town at 11.23.&nbsp; Will you give me the
addresses where I may inquire, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&nbsp; I am going myself.&nbsp; You would be of no
use,&rsquo; said Mervyn, in a stunned, mechanical way; and
looking at his watch, he went to give orders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He should not go, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; In his state the
mere journey is a fearful risk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall go with him.&nbsp; You stay to
take care of Maria.&nbsp; There will be Robert to help us;&rsquo;
and as the governess would have spoken farther, she held up her
hands in entreaty&mdash;&lsquo;O pray don&rsquo;t say
anything!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t go on if I do anything but
act.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet in the endeavour to keep her brother quiet, and to husband
his powers, Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s movements and words had rather an
additional gentleness and deliberation; and so free from bustle
was her whole demeanour, that he never comprehended her intention
of accompanying him till she stepped into the carriage beside
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; You coming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will give you no trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you may help to manage the girl;&rsquo; and he
lay back, relieved to be off, but already spent by the hurry of
the last two hours.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be could sit
and&mdash;no&mdash;not think, except that Robert was at the other
end of the line.</p>
<p>The drive seemed to have lasted half the night ere the lamps
of Elverslope made constellations in the valley, and the green
and red lights of the station loomed out on the hill.&nbsp; They
drove into the circle of gaslights, among the vaporous steeds of
omnibuses and flies, and entered the station, Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
veil down, and Mervyn shading his dazzled eyes from the
glare.&nbsp; They were half an hour too soon; and while waiting,
it occurred to Ph&oelig;be to inquire whether a telegram for
Beauchamp had been received.&nbsp; Even so, and they must have
crossed the express; but a duplicate was brought to them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Safe.&nbsp; We shall be at Elverslope at 10.20,
P.M.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Assuredly Ph&oelig;be did not faint, for she stood on her
feet; and Mervyn never perceived the suspension of senses, which
lasted till she found him for the second time asking whether she
would go home or await the travellers at Elverslope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home,&rsquo; she said, instinctively, in her relief
forgetting all the distress of what had taken place, so that her
sensations were little short of felicity; and as she heard the
8.30 train roaring up, she shed tears of joy at having no concern
therewith.&nbsp; The darkness and Mervyn&rsquo;s silence were
comfortable, for she <!-- page 406--><a name="page406"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 406</span>could wipe unseen her showers of
tears at each gust of thankfulness that passed over her; and it
was long before she could command her voice even to ask her
companion whether he were tired.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said;
but the tone was more than half-sullen; and at the thought of the
meeting between the brothers, poor Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart
seemed to die within her.&nbsp; Against their dark looks and curt
sayings to one another she had no courage.</p>
<p>When they reached home, she begged him to go at once to bed,
hoping thus to defer the meeting; but he would not hear of doing
so; and her only good augury was that his looks were pale,
languid, and subdued, rather than flushed and excited.&nbsp; Miss
Fennimore was in the hall, and he went towards her, saying, in a
friendly tone, &lsquo;So, Miss Fennimore, you have heard that
this unlucky child has given us a fright for nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice in which she assented was hoarse and scarcely
audible, and she looked as if twenty years had passed over her
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was all owing to your promptitude,&rsquo; said
Mervyn; &lsquo;a capital thought that telegram.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore; &lsquo;but I do
not lose sight of my own negligence.&nbsp; It convinces me that I
am utterly unfit for the charge I assumed.&nbsp; I shall leave
your sisters as soon as new plans can be formed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll be bound none of your pupils ever
played you such a trick before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore only looked as if this convinced her the more;
but it was no time for the argument, and Ph&oelig;be caressingly
persuaded her to come into the library and drink coffee with
them, judging rightly that she had tasted nothing since
morning.</p>
<p>Afterwards Ph&oelig;be induced Mervyn to lie on the sofa, and
having made every preparation for the travellers, she sat down to
wait.&nbsp; She could not read, she could not work; she felt that
tranquillity was needful for her brother, and had learnt already
the soothing effect of absolute repose.&nbsp; Indeed, one of the
first tokens by which Miss Fennimore had perceived character in
Ph&oelig;be was her faculty of being still.&nbsp; Only that which
has substance can be motionless.&nbsp; There she sat in the
lamplight, her head drooping, her hands clasped on her knee, her
eyes bent down, not drowsy, not abstracted, not rigid, but
peaceful.&nbsp; Her brother lay in the shade, watching her with a
half-fascinated gaze, as though a magnetic spell repressed all
inclination to work himself into agitation.</p>
<p>The stillness became an effort at last, but it was resolutely
preserved till the frost-bound gravel resounded with
wheels.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be rose, Mervyn started up, caught her
hand and squeezed it hard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not let him be hard on
me, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could not bear
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had little expected this.&nbsp; Her answer was a mute
caress, and she hurried out, but in a tumult of feeling,
retreated behind <!-- page 407--><a name="page407"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 407</span>the shelter of a pillar, and
silently put her hand on Robert&rsquo;s arm as he stepped out of
the carriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; he whispered, holding her back.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hush!&nbsp; I have promised that she shall see no
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha descended, unassisted, her veil down, and neither
turning to the right nor the left, crossed the hall and went
upstairs.&nbsp; Robert took off his overcoat and hat, took a
light and followed her, signing that Ph&oelig;be should remain
behind.&nbsp; She found Mervyn at the library door, like herself
rather appalled at the apparition that had swept past them.&nbsp;
She put her hand into his, with a kind of common feeling that
they were awaiting a strict judge.</p>
<p>Robert soon reappeared, and in a preoccupied way, kissed the
one and shook hands with the other, saying, &lsquo;She has locked
her door, and says she wants nothing.&nbsp; I will try again
presently&mdash;not you, Ph&oelig;be; I could only get her home
on condition she should see no one without her own consent.&nbsp;
So you had my telegram?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We met it at the station.&nbsp; How did you find
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had the man been written to?&rsquo; asked Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mervyn; &lsquo;we thought it best to
treat it as childish nonsense, not worth serious notice, or in
fact&mdash;I was not equal to writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The weary, dejected tone made Robert look up, contrary to the
brothers&rsquo; usual habit of avoiding one another&rsquo;s eye,
and he exclaimed, &lsquo;I did not know!&nbsp; You were not going
to London to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worse staying at home,&rsquo; murmured Mervyn, as,
leaning on a corner of the mantelshelf, he rested his head on his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was coming with him,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;I thought if he gave directions, you could act.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert continued to cast at him glances of dismay and
compunction while pursuing the narrative.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hastings
must have learnt by some means that the speculation was not what
he had imagined; for though he met her at
Paddington&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She had telegraphed to him while waiting at
Swindon.&nbsp; He found her out before I did, but he felt himself
in a predicament, and I believe I was a welcome sight to
him.&nbsp; He begged me to do him the justice to acquit him of
all participation in this rash step, and said he had only met
Bertha with a view to replacing her in the hands of her
family.&nbsp; How it would have been without me, I cannot tell,
but I am inclined to believe that he did not know how to dispose
of her.&nbsp; She clung to him and turned away from me so
decidedly that I was almost grateful for the line he took; and he
was obliged to tell her, with many fine speeches, that he could
not expose her to share his poverty; and when the poor silly
child declared she had enough for both, he told her plainly that
it would not be available for six years, and he could not let
her&mdash;tenderly nurtured, etc., etc.&nbsp; Then <!-- page
408--><a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>supposing me uninformed, he disclaimed all betrayal of
your confidence, and represented all that had passed as sport
with a child, which to his surprise she had taken as
earnest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Bertha!&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray where did this scene take place?&rsquo; asked
Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the platform; but it was far too quiet to attract
notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you had no fits nor struggles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think not,&rsquo; smiled Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She stood like a statue, when she understood him; and
when he would audaciously have shaken hands with her, she made a
distant courtesy, quite dignified.&nbsp; I took her to the
waiting-room, and put back her veil.&nbsp; She was crimson, and
nearly choking, but she repelled me, and never gave way.&nbsp; I
asked if she would sleep at an inn and go home to-morrow; she
said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told her I could not take her to
my place because of the curates.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to a
sisterhood,&rdquo; she said; and when I told her she was in no
mood to be received there, she answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I proposed taking her to Augusta, but
that was worse; and at last I got her to come home in the dark,
on my promise that she should see no one till she chose.&nbsp;
Not a word has she since uttered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could he really have meant it all in play?&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;yet there was his letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see it all,&rsquo; said Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was an
ass to suppose such needy rogues could come near girls of fortune
without running up the scent.&nbsp; As I told Ph&oelig;be, I know
they had some monstrous ideas of the amount, which I never
thought it worth my while to contradict.&nbsp; I imagine old Jack
only intended a promising little flirtation, capable of being
brought to bear if occasion served, but otherwise to be cast
aside as child&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; Nobody could suspect such an
inflammable nature with that baby face; but it seems she was
ready to eat her fingers with dulness in the school-room, and had
prodigious notions of the rights of woman; so she took all he
said most seriously, and met him more than half-way.&nbsp; Then
he goes to London, gets better information, looks at the will in
Doctors&rsquo; Commons, maybe, finds it a slowish speculation,
and wants to let her down easy; whereof she has no notion, writes
two letters to his one, as we know, gets desperate, and makes
this excursion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert thoughtfully said &lsquo;Yes;&rsquo; and Ph&oelig;be,
though she did not like to betray it, mentally owned that the
intercepted letter confirmed Mervyn&rsquo;s opinion, being
evidently meant to pacify what was inconveniently ardent and
impassioned, without making tangible promises or professions.</p>
<p>The silence was broken by Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;There!&nbsp; I
shall go to bed.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, when you see that poor child,
tell her not to be afraid of me, for the scrape was of my making,
so don&rsquo;t be sharp with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; said Robert gravely; &lsquo;I am
beginning to learn <!-- page 409--><a name="page409"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 409</span>that severity is injustice, not
justice.&nbsp; Good night, Mervyn; I hope this has not done you
harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad not to be at Paddington this minute,&rsquo;
said Mervyn.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will stay and help us through this
business.&nbsp; It is past us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will stay as long as I can, if you wish
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s fervent &lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; was for
both.&nbsp; She had never heard such friendly tones between those
two, though Mervyn&rsquo;s were still half sullen, and chiefly
softened by dejection and weariness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; cried Robert, as the door
closed, &lsquo;how could you not tell me this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I had told you that he was very
unwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unwell!&nbsp; I never saw any one so much
altered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is at his best when he is pale.&nbsp; The attacks
are only kept off by reducing him, and he must be materially
better to have no threatening after such a day as
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am glad you have not had the letter that I
posted only to-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you were displeased,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;and you see you were quite right in not wishing us to stay
here; but you forgive us now&mdash;Mervyn and me, I
mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t couple yourself with him,
Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I must; for we both equally misjudged, and he
blames himself more than any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His looks plead for him as effectually as you can do,
Ph&oelig;be, and rebuke me for having fancied you weak and
perverse in remaining after the remonstrance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wonder at it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;but it is over now, and don&rsquo;t let us talk about
it.&nbsp; I want nothing to spoil the comfort of knowing that I
have you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a multitude of things to say, but you look
sleepy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am afraid I am.&nbsp; I should like to sit up
all night to make the most of you, but I could not keep
awake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Childlike, she no sooner had some one on whom to repose her
care than slumber claimed its due, and she went away to her
thankful rest, treasuring the thought of Robert&rsquo;s presence,
and resting in the ineffable blessing of being able to overlook
the thorns in gratitude for the roses.</p>
<p>Bertha did not appear in the morning.&nbsp; Robert went to her
door, and was told that she would see no one; and
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s entreaties for admission were met with
silence, till he forbade their repetition.&nbsp; &lsquo;It only
hardens her,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;we must leave her to
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will not eat, she will be ill!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If she do not yield at dinner-time, Lieschen shall
carry food to her, but she shall not have the pleasure of
disappointing you.&nbsp; Sullenness must be left to weary itself
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not this more shame than sullenness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True shame hides its face and confesses&mdash;sullen
shame hides like Adam.&nbsp; If hers had not been stubborn, it
would have <!-- page 410--><a name="page410"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 410</span>melted at your voice.&nbsp; She must
wait to hear it again, till she have learnt to crave for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked so resolute that Ph&oelig;be durst plead no longer,
but her heart sank at the thought of the obstinate force of poor
Bertha&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; Persistence was innate in the
Fulmorts, and it was likely to be a severe and lasting trial
whether Robert or Bertha would hold out the longest.&nbsp; Since
he had captured her, however, all were relieved tacitly to give
her up to his management; and at dinner-time, on his stern
assurance that unless she would accept food, the door would be
forced, she admitted some sandwiches and tea, and desired to have
her firing replenished, but would allow no one to enter.</p>
<p>Robert, at Mervyn&rsquo;s earnest entreaty, arranged to remain
over the Sunday.&nbsp; The two brothers met shyly at first, using
Ph&oelig;be as a medium of communication; but they drew nearer
after a time, in the discussion of the robbery, and Robert
presently found means of helping Mervyn, by letter-writing, and
taking business off his hands to which Ph&oelig;be was
unequal.&nbsp; Both concurred in insisting that Ph&oelig;be
should keep her engagement to the Raymonds for the morrow, as the
only means of preventing Bertha&rsquo;s escapade from making a
sensation; and by night she became satisfied that not only would
the brothers keep the peace in her absence, but that a
day&rsquo;s <i>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&eacute;te</i> might rather
promote their good understanding.</p>
<p>Still, she was in no mood to enjoy, when she had to leave
Bertha&rsquo;s door still unopened, and the only comfort she
could look to was in the conversation with Miss Charlecote on the
way.&nbsp; From her, there was no concealing what had happened,
and, to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s surprise, she was encouraging.&nbsp;
From an external point of view, she could judge better than those
more nearly concerned, and her elder years made her more
conscious what time could do.&nbsp; She would not let the
adventure be regarded as a lasting blight on Bertha&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; Had the girl been a few years older, she could never
have held up her head again; but as it was, Honor foretold that,
by the time she was twenty, the adventure would appear
incredible.&nbsp; It was not to be lightly passed over, but she
must not be allowed to lose her self-respect, nor despair of
regaining a place in the family esteem.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could not imagine her ever recovering the being
thus cast off by her first love.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, believe me, it was not love at all, only
mystery and the rights of woman.&nbsp; Her very demonstrativeness
shows that it was not the heart, but the vanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to believe, and at least was refreshed by
the sympathy, so as to be able, to her own surprise, to be
pleased and happy at Moorcroft, where Sir John and his wife were
full of kindness, and the bright household mirth of the sons and
daughters showed Ph&oelig;be some of the benefit Miss Fennimore
expected for Bertha from girl friends.&nbsp; One of the younger
ones showed her a present in preparation for &lsquo;cousin
Cecily,&rsquo; and <!-- page 411--><a name="page411"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 411</span>embarked in a list of the names of
the cousinhood at Sutton; and though an elder sister decidedly
closed young Harriet&rsquo;s mouth, yet afterwards Ph&oelig;be
was favoured with a sight of a photograph of the dear cousin, and
inferred from it that the young lady&rsquo;s looks were quite
severe enough to account for her cruelty.</p>
<p>The having been plunged into a new atmosphere was good for
Ph&oelig;be, and she brought home so cheerful a face, that even
the news of Bertha&rsquo;s continued obstinacy could not long
sadden it, in the enjoyment of the sight of Robert making himself
necessary to Mervyn, and Mervyn accepting his services as if
there had never been anything but brotherly love between
them.&nbsp; She could have blessed Bertha for having thus brought
them together, and felt as if it were a dream too happy to
last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an accountant Robert is!&rsquo; said Mervyn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is a real sacrifice not to have him in the
business!&nbsp; What a thing we should have made of it, and he
would have taken all the bother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have done very well to-day,&rsquo; was
Robert&rsquo;s account; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what can have
been the matter before, except my propensity for making myself
disagreeable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be went to bed revolving plans for softening Bertha,
and was fast asleep when the lock of her door was turned.&nbsp;
As she awoke, the terrors of the robbery were upon her far more
strongly than at the actual moment of its occurrence; but the
voice was familiar, though thin, weak, and gasping.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Ph&oelig;be, I&rsquo;ve done it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
starved myself.&nbsp; I am dying;&rsquo; and the sound became a
shrill cry.&nbsp; &lsquo;The dark!&nbsp; O save me!&rsquo; There
was a heavy fall, and Ph&oelig;be, springing to the spot where
the white vision had sunk down, strove to lift a weight, cold as
marble, without pulse or motion.&nbsp; She contrived to raise it,
and drag it with her into her own bed, though in deadly terror at
the icy touch and prone helplessness, and she was feeling in
desperation for the bell-rope, when to her great relief, light
and steps approached, and Robert spoke.&nbsp; Alas! his candle
only served to show the ghastly, senseless face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has starved herself!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with
affright.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A swoon, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; said Robert, who
was dressed, and had evidently been watching.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try to
warm her; I will fetch something for her; we shall soon bring her
round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A swoon, only a swoon,&rsquo; Ph&oelig;be was forced to
reiterate to herself to keep her senses and check the sobbing
screams that swelled in her throat during the hour-like moments
of his absence.&nbsp; She rose, and partly dressed herself in
haste, then strove to chafe the limbs; but her efforts only
struck the deathly chill more deeply into her own heart.</p>
<p>He brought some brandy, with which they moistened her lips,
but still in vain, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s dismay was redoubled
as she saw his terror.&nbsp; &lsquo;It <i>must</i> be
fainting,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;but I had better send for
Jackson.&nbsp; May God have mercy on us all&mdash;this is my
fault!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 412--><a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
412</span>&lsquo;Her lips move,&rsquo; gasped Ph&oelig;be, as she
rubbed the temples with the stimulant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; and again they put the spoon to her
lips, as the nostrils expanded, the eyes opened, and she seemed
to crave for the cordial.&nbsp; But vainly Robert raised her in
his arms, and Ph&oelig;be steadied her own trembling hand to
administer it, there were only choking, sobbing efforts for
words, resulting in hoarse shrieks of anguish.</p>
<p>Mervyn and Miss Fennimore, entering nearly at the same moment,
found Ph&oelig;be pale as death, urging composure with a voice of
despair; and Robert with looks of horror that he could no longer
control, holding up the sinking child, her face livid, her eyes
strained.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she
cried, with frightful catches of her breath; &lsquo;I shall
die&mdash;&rsquo; and the screams recurred.</p>
<p>Mervyn could not bear the spectacle for an instant, and fled
only to return to listen outside.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore brought
authority and presence of mind.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hysterical,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There, lay her down; don&rsquo;t try again
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hunger,&rsquo; whispered the trembling
Ph&oelig;be; but Miss Fennimore only signed to be obeyed, and
decidedly saying, &lsquo;Be quiet, Bertha, don&rsquo;t
speak,&rsquo; the habit of submission silenced all but the
choking sobs.&nbsp; She sent Robert to warm a shawl, ordered away
the frightened maids, and enforced stillness, which lasted till
Bertha had recovered breath, when she sobbed out again,
&lsquo;Robert!&nbsp; Where is he!&nbsp; I shall die!&nbsp; He
must pray!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore bade Robert compose his voice to pray aloud,
and what he read tranquillized all except Mervyn, who understood
this to mean the worst, and burst away to sit cowering in
suspense over his fire.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore then offered Bertha
a morsel of roll dipped in port wine, but fasting and agitation
had really produced a contraction of the muscles of the throat,
and the attempt failed.&nbsp; Bertha was dreadfully terrified,
and Ph&oelig;be could hardly control herself, but she was the
only person unbanished by Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; Even
Robert&rsquo;s distress became too visible for the absolute calm
by which the governess hoped to exhaust the hysteria while
keeping up vitality by outward applications of warmth and
stimulants, and from time to time renewing the endeavour to
administer nourishment.</p>
<p>It was not till two terrible hours had passed that Ph&oelig;be
came to the school-room, and announced to her brothers that after
ten minutes&rsquo; doze, Bertha had waked, and swallowed a
spoonful of arrowroot and wine without choking.&nbsp; She could
not restrain her sobs, and wept uncontrollably as Mervyn put his
arm round her.&nbsp; He was the most composed of the three, for
her powers had been sorely strained, and Robert had suffered most
of all.</p>
<p>He had on this day suspected that Bertha was burning the
provisions forced on her, but he had kept silence, believing that
she would thus reduce herself to a more amenable state than if
<!-- page 413--><a name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
413</span>she were angered by compulsion, and long before serious
harm could ensue.&nbsp; Used to the sight of famine, he thought
inanition would break the spirit without injuring the
health.&nbsp; Many a time had he beheld those who professed to
have tasted nothing for two days, trudge off tottering but
cheerful, with a soup-ticket, and he had not calculated on the
difference between the children of want and the delicately
nurtured girl, full of overwrought feeling.&nbsp; Though he had
been watching in loving intercession for the unhappy child, and
had resolved on forcing his way to her in the morning, he felt as
if he had played the part of the Archbishop of Pisa, and that,
had she perished in her fearful determination, her blood would
have been on himself.&nbsp; He was quite overcome, and forced to
hurry to his own room to compose himself, ere he could return to
inquire further; but there was little more to hear.&nbsp; Miss
Fennimore desired to be alone with the patient; Ph&oelig;be
allowed herself to be laid on the sofa and covered with shawls;
Mervyn returned to his bed, and Robert still watched.</p>
<p>There was a great calm after the storm, and Ph&oelig;be did
not wake till the dim wintry dawn was struggling with the yellow
candlelight, and a consultation was going on in low tones between
Robert and the governess, both wan and haggard in the
uncomfortable light, and their words not more cheering than their
looks.&nbsp; Bertha had become feverish, passing from restless,
talking sleep to startled, painful wakening, and Miss Fennimore
wished Dr. Martyn to be sent for.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be shivered with
a cold chill of disappointment as she gathered their meaning, and
coming forward, entreated the watchers to lie down to rest, while
she relieved guard; but nothing would persuade Miss Fennimore to
relinquish her post; and soon Ph&oelig;be had enough to do
elsewhere; for her own peculiar patient, Mervyn, was so ill
throughout the morning, that she was constantly employed in his
room, and Robert looking on and trying to aid her, hated himself
doubly for his hasty judgments.</p>
<p>Maria alone could go to church on that Sunday morning, and her
version of the state of affairs brought Miss Charlecote to
Beauchamp to offer her assistance.&nbsp; She saw Dr. Martyn, and
undertook the painful preliminary explanation, and she saw him
again after his inspection of Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a first-rate governess!&nbsp; Exactly
so!&nbsp; An educational hot-bed.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t people
let girls dress dolls and trundle hoops, as they used to
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never thought Bertha oppressed by her
lessons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the worse!&nbsp; Those who can&rsquo;t learn,
or won&rsquo;t learn, take care of themselves.&nbsp; Those who
have a brain and use it are those that suffer!&nbsp; To hear that
poor child blundering algebra in her sleep might be a caution to
mothers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever see her before, so as to observe the
little hesitation in her speech?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, they should have mentioned that.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 414--><a name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
414</span>&lsquo;It is generally very slight; but one of
them&mdash;I think, Maria&mdash;told me that she always stammered
more after lessons&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The blindness of people!&nbsp; As if that had not been
a sufficient thermometer to show when they were overworking her
brain!&nbsp; Why, not one of these Fulmorts has a head that will
bear liberties being taken with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you let us hope that this whole affair came from an
affection of the brain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The elopement!&nbsp; No; I can&rsquo;t flatter you that
health or sanity were in fault there.&nbsp; Nor is it delirium
now; the rambling is only in sleep.&nbsp; But the three
days&rsquo; fast&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two days, was it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three.&nbsp; She took nothing since breakfast on
Thursday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you made out how she passed the last two
days?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrung out some account.&nbsp; I believe this would
never have occurred to her if her brother had given her a
sandwich at Paddington; but she came home exhausted into a
distaste for food, which other feelings exaggerated into a fancy
to die rather than face the family.&nbsp; She burnt the
provisions in a rage at their being forced on her, and she slept
most of the time&mdash;torpor without acute suffering.&nbsp; Last
night in sleep she lost her hold of her resolution, and woke to
the sense of self-preservation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An infinite mercy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that the spirit is broken; all her strength goes to
sullenness, and I never saw a case needing greater
judgment.&nbsp; Now that she is reduced, the previous overwork
tells on her, and it will be a critical matter to bring her
round.&nbsp; Who can be of use here?&nbsp; Not the married
sisters, I suppose?&nbsp; Miss Fulmort is all that a girl can be
at nineteen or twenty, but she wants age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think it will be a bad illness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may not assume an acute form, but it may last a good
while; and if they wish her to have any health again, they must
mind what they are about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora felt a task set to her.&nbsp; She must be
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s experience as far as her fifty years could
teach her to deal with a little precocious rationalist in a wild
travestie of Thekla.&nbsp; <i>Ich habe geliebt und gelebet</i>
was the farewell laid on Bertha&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; What a
Thekla and what a Max!&nbsp; O profanation!&nbsp; But Honor felt
Bertha a charge of her own, and her aid was the more thankfully
accepted that the patient was quite beyond Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; She
had too long rebelled against her sister to find rest in her
guardianship.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s voice disposed her to
resistance, her advice to wrangling, and Miss Fennimore alone had
power to enforce what was needful; and so devoted was she, that
Honor could scarcely persuade her to lie down to rest for a few
hours.</p>
<p>Honor was dismayed at the change from the childish
<i>espi&egrave;gle</i> roundness of feature to a withered,
scathed countenance, singularly old, and mournfully contrasting
with the mischievous-looking <!-- page 415--><a
name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 415</span>waves and
rings of curly hair upon the brow.&nbsp; Premature playing at
passion had been sport with edged tools.&nbsp; Sleeping, the talk
was less, however, of the supposed love, than of science and
metaphysics; waking, there was silence between weakness and
sullenness.</p>
<p>Thus passed day after day, always in the same feverish
lethargic oppression which baffled medical skill, and kept the
sick mind beyond the reach of human aid; and so uniform were the
days, that her illness seemed to last for months instead of
weeks.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore insisted on the night-watching for her
share.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be divided with her and Lieschen the
morning cares; and Miss Charlecote came in the forenoon and
stayed till night, but slept at home, whither Maria was kindly
invited; but Ph&oelig;be did not like to send her away without
herself or Lieschen, and Robert undertook for her being
inoffensive to Mervyn.&nbsp; In fact, she was obliging and
unobtrusive, only speaking when addressed, and a willing
messenger.&nbsp; Mervyn first forgot her presence, then tolerated
her saucer eyes, then found her capable of running his errands,
and lastly began to care to please her.&nbsp; Honora had devised
employment for her, by putting a drawer of patchwork at her
disposal, and suggesting that she should make a workbag for each
of Robert&rsquo;s 139 school girls; and the occupation this
afforded her was such a public benefit, that Robert was content
to pay the tax of telling her the destination of each individual
bag, and being always corrected if he twice mentioned the same
name.&nbsp; When Mervyn dozed in his chair, she would require
from Robert &lsquo;stories&rsquo; of his scholars; and it even
came to pass that Mervyn would recur to what had then passed, as
though he had not been wholly asleep.</p>
<p>Mervyn was chiefly dependent on his brother for conversation,
entertainment, and assistance in his affairs; and though not a
word passed upon their differences and no professions were made,
the common anxiety, and Mervyn&rsquo;s great need of help, had
swept away all traces of unfriendliness.&nbsp; Not even when
children in the nursery had they been so free from variance or
bitterness as while waiting the issue of their sister&rsquo;s
illness; both humbled, both feeling themselves in part the cause,
each anxious to cheer and console the other&mdash;one, weak,
subdued, dependent&mdash;the other, considerate, helpful, and
eager to atone for past harshness.&nbsp; Strange for brothers to
wait till the ages of twenty-nine and twenty-seven to find out
that they really did prefer each other to every one else, in
spite of the immense differences between their characters and
habits!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; asked Mervyn, one day, when resting after
having brought on giddiness and confusion by directing Robert how
to answer a letter from the office, &lsquo;what would you do with
this bore of a business, if it came to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get rid of it,&rsquo; said Robert, surveying him with
startled eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye&mdash;sell it, and get the devilry, as you call it,
multiplied to all infinity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 416--><a name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
416</span>&lsquo;Close it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boil soup in the coppers; bake loaves in the
furnaces?&nbsp; It makes you look at me perilously&mdash;and a
perilous game you would find it, most likely to swallow this
place and all the rest.&nbsp; Why, you, who had the making of a
man of business in you, might reflect that you can&rsquo;t
annihilate property without damage to other folks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not reflect,&rsquo; said Robert, gravely;
&lsquo;the matter never occurred to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the result of your reflection now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; was the somewhat impatient
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I trust never to have to consider.&nbsp; Get
it out of my hands at any sacrifice, so as it may do the least
harm to others.&nbsp; Had I no other objection to that business,
I should have no choice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your cloth?&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s a pity, for I see
how it could be mitigated, so as to satisfy your scruples;&rsquo;
and Mervyn, whose head could work when it was not necessary,
detailed a scheme for gradually contracting the most
objectionable traffic, and adopting another branch of the
trade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellent,&rsquo; said Robert, assenting with delight
at each pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will carry it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only a reprobate
distiller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There it ended, and Robert must have patience.</p>
<p>The guardian, Mr. Crabbe, came as soon as his gout would
permit, and hemmed and grunted in reply to the strange narrative
into which he had come to inquire.&nbsp; Acting was as yet
impossible; Mervyn was forbidden to transact business, and Bertha
was far too ill for the removal of the young ladies to be
attempted.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore did indeed formally give in her
resignation of her situation, but she was too necessary as a
nurse for the time of her departure to be fixed, and Mr. Crabbe
was unable to settle anything definitively.&nbsp; He found
Robert&mdash;who previously had spurred him to strong
measures&mdash;bent on persuading him to lenity, and especially
on keeping Ph&oelig;be with Mervyn; and after a day and night of
perplexity, the old gentleman took his leave, promising to come
again on Bertha&rsquo;s recovery, and to pacify the two elder
sisters by representing the condition of Beauchamp, and that for
the present the Incumbent of St. Matthew&rsquo;s and Miss
Charlecote might be considered as sufficient guardians for the
inmates.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or if their Ladyships thought
otherwise,&rsquo; he said, with a twinkle in his eye, &lsquo;why
did they not come down themselves?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn made a gesture of horror, but all knew that there was
little danger.&nbsp; Augusta was always &lsquo;so low&rsquo; at
the sight of illness, and unless Ph&oelig;be had been the patient
out of sight, Juliana would not have brought her husband; obvious
as would have been the coming of an elder sister when the
sickness of the younger dragged on so slowly and wearily.</p>
<p>No one went through so much as Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; Each hour
of her attendance on Bertha stamped the sense of her own <!--
page 417--><a name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
417</span>failure, and of the fallacies to which her life had
been dedicated.&nbsp; The sincerity, honour, and modesty that she
had inculcated, had been founded on self-esteem alone; and when
they had proved inadequate to prevent their breach, their
outraged relics had prompted the victim to despair and die.&nbsp;
Intellectual development and reasoning powers had not availed one
moment against inclination and self-will, and only survived in
the involuntary murmurs of a disordered nervous system.&nbsp; All
this had utterly overthrown that satisfaction in herself and her
own moral qualities in which Miss Fennimore had always lived; she
had become sensible of the deep flaws in all that she had admired
in her own conduct; and her reason being already prepared by her
long and earnest study to accept the faith in its fulness, she
had begun to crave after the Atoning Mercy of which she sorely
felt the need.&nbsp; But if it be hard for one who has never
questioned to take home individually the efficacy of the great
Sacrifice, how much harder for one taught to deny the Godhead
which rendered the Victim worthy to satisfy Eternal
Justice?&nbsp; She accepted the truth, but the gracious words
would not reach her spirit; they were to her as a feast in a
hungry man&rsquo;s dream.&nbsp; Robert alone was aware of the
struggles through which she was passing, and he could do little
in direct aid of her; the books&mdash;even the passages of
Scripture that he found for her&mdash;seemed to fall short; it
was as though the sufferer in the wilderness lay in sight of the
brazen serpent, but his eyes were holden that he could not see
it.</p>
<p>Only the governess&rsquo;s strong and untaxed health could
have carried her through her distress and fatigue, for she
continued to engross the most trying share of the nursing,
anxious to shield Ph&oelig;be from even the knowledge of all the
miseries of Bertha&rsquo;s nights, when the poor child would
start on her pillow with a shriek, gaze wildly round, trembling
in every limb, the dew starting on her brow, face well-nigh
convulsed, teeth chattering, and strange, incoherent
words&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dream, only a dream!&rsquo; she murmured, recovering
consciousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was only a dream?&rsquo; asked Miss Fennimore, one
night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing!&rsquo; but she still shivered; then
striving to catch hold of the broken threads of her philosophy,
&lsquo;How one&rsquo;s imagination is a prey
to&mdash;to&mdash;what is it?&nbsp; To&mdash;to old
impressions&mdash;when one is weak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of impressions?&rsquo; asked Miss Fennimore,
resolved to probe the matter.</p>
<p>Bertha, whose defect of speech was greatly increased by
weakness, was long in making her answer comprehensible; but Miss
Fennimore gathered it at last, and it made her spirit quake, for
it referred to the terrors beyond the grave.&nbsp; Yet she firmly
answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such impressions may not always result from
weakness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; cried Bertha, rising on her elbow,
&lsquo;I thought that <!-- page 418--><a name="page418"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 418</span>an advanced state of civilization
dispenses with sectarian&mdash;I mean superstitious&mdash;literal
threats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No civilization can change those decrees, nor make them
unmerited,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; repeated Bertha, frowning.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You, too?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean that?&nbsp; You are
not one of the narrow minds that want to doom their
fellow-creatures for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her eyes had grown large,
round, and bright, and she clutched Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s hand,
gasping, &lsquo;Say, not for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor child! did I ever teach you it was
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You thought so!&rsquo; cried Bertha; &lsquo;enlightened
people think so.&nbsp; O say&mdash;only say it does not
last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha, I cannot.&nbsp; God forgive me for the
falsehoods to which I led you, the realities I put aside from
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha gave a cry of anguish, and sank back exhausted, damps
of terror on her brow; but she presently cried out, &lsquo;If it
would not last!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear the thought!&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t bear to live, but I can&rsquo;t die!&nbsp; Oh! who
will save me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s lips rose the words of St. Paul to
the jailer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe! believe!&rsquo; cried Bertha, petulantly,
&lsquo;believe what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe that He gave His Life to purchase your safety
and mine through that Eternity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Fennimore sank on her knees, weeping and hiding her
face.&nbsp; The words which she had gazed at, and listened to, in
vain longing, had&mdash;even as she imparted them&mdash;touched
herself in their fulness.&nbsp; She had seen the face of Truth,
when, at Mrs. Fulmort&rsquo;s death-bed, she had heard
Ph&oelig;be speak of the Blood that cleanseth from all sin.&nbsp;
Then it had been a moment&rsquo;s glimpse.&nbsp; She had sought
it earnestly ever since, and at length it had come to nestle
within her own bosom.&nbsp; It was not sight, it was
touch&mdash;it was embracing and holding fast.</p>
<p>Alas! the sight was hidden from Bertha.&nbsp; She moodily
turned aside in vexation, as though her last trust had failed
her.&nbsp; In vain did Miss Fennimore, feeling that she had led
her to the brink of an abyss of depth unknown, till she was
tottering on the verge, lavish on her the most tender
cares.&nbsp; They were requited with resentful gloom, that the
governess felt to be so just towards herself that she would
hardly have been able to lift up her head but for the new
reliance that gave peace to deepening contrition.</p>
<p>That was a bad night, and the day was worse.&nbsp; Bertha had
more strength, but more fever; and the much-enduring Ph&oelig;be
could hardly be persuaded to leave her to Miss Charlecote at
dusk, and air herself with her brothers in the garden.&nbsp; The
weather was close and misty, and Honora set open the door to
admit the air from the open passage window.&nbsp; A low, soft,
lulling sound came in, so much softened by distance that the tune
alone showed that it was an infant school ditty sung by Maria,
while rocking herself in her low chair over the <!-- page
419--><a name="page419"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
419</span>school-room fire.&nbsp; Turning to discover whether the
invalid were annoyed by it, Honor beheld the hard, keen little
eyes intently fixed, until presently they filled with tears; and
with a heavy sigh, the words broke forth, &lsquo;Oh! to be as
silly as she is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As <i>selig</i>, you mean,&rsquo; said Honor,
kindly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the same thing,&rsquo; she said, with a bitter
ring in her poor worn voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it is not weakness that makes your sister
happy.&nbsp; She was far less happy before she learnt to use her
powers lovingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With such earnestness that her stuttering was very painful to
hear, she exclaimed, &lsquo;Miss Charlecote, I can&rsquo;t
recollect things&mdash;I get puzzled&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say what
I want to say.&nbsp; Tell me, is not my brain softening or
weakening?&nbsp; You know Maria had water on the head
once!&rsquo; and her accents were pitiably full of hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, my dear, you are not becoming like
Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were,&rsquo; said Bertha, certainly showing no
such resemblance, &lsquo;I suppose I should not know it.&nbsp; I
wonder whether Maria be ever conscious of her <i>Ich</i>,&rsquo;
said she, with a weary sigh, as if this were a companion whence
she could not escape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear child, your <i>Ich</i> would be set aside by
living to others, who only seek to make you happier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish they would let me alone.&nbsp; If they had,
there would have been an end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An end&mdash;no indeed, my poor child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; cried Bertha; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what it
is to live!&nbsp; To be shuddered at!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Bertha, I did not shudder at the wild delusion and
indiscretion, which may be lived down and redeemed, but at the
fearful act that would have cut you off from all hope, and
chained you to yourself, and such a self, for ever, never to part
from the shame whence you sought to escape.&nbsp; Yes, surely
there must have been pleading in Heaven to win for you that
instant&rsquo;s relenting.&nbsp; Rescued twice over, there must
be some work for you to do, something to cast into shade all that
has passed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will not destroy memory!&rsquo; she said, with
hopeless indifference.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but you may be so occupied with it as to rise above
your present pain and humiliation, and remember them only to
gather new force from your thankfulness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, that I was made a fool of?&rsquo; cried Bertha,
with sharpness in her thin voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you were brought back to the new life that is
before you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Bertha made no answer, Honor trusted that a beginning
had been made, but only to be disappointed, for the fever was
higher the next day, and Bertha was too much oppressed for
speech.&nbsp; The only good sign was that in the dusk she desired
that the door should be left open, in case Maria should be
singing.&nbsp; It was the first preference she had evinced.&nbsp;
The brothers were ready to crown Maria, and she sang with <!--
page 420--><a name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
420</span>such good-will that Ph&oelig;be was forced to take
precautions, fearing lest the harmony should lose &lsquo;the
modest charm of not too much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a decided liking for Maria&rsquo;s company,
partly no doubt from her envied deficiency, and her ignorance of
the extent of Bertha&rsquo;s misdemeanour, partly because there
was less effort of mind in intercourse with her.&nbsp; Her
pleasure in waiting on her sister was likewise so warm and
grateful, that Bertha felt herself conferring a favour, and took
everything from her in a spirit very different from the dull
submission towards Miss Fennimore or the peevish tyranny over
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Towards no one else save Miss Charlecote did
she show any favour, for though their conversation was never even
alluded to, it had probably left a pleasant impression, and
possibly she was entertained by Honor&rsquo;s systematic habit of
talking of the world beyond to the other nurses in her
presence.</p>
<p>But these likings were far more scantily shown than her
dislikes, and it was hard for her attendants to acquiesce in the
physician&rsquo;s exhortations to be patient till her spirits and
nerves should have recovered the shock.&nbsp; Even the entrance
of a new housemaid threw her into a trepidation which she was
long in recovering, and any proposal of seeing any person beyond
the few who had been with her from the first, occasioned
trembling, entreaties, and tears.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, after her brief heroineship, had lapsed into
quite a secondary position.&nbsp; In the reaction of the
brothers&rsquo; feeling towards each other, they almost left her
out.&nbsp; Both were too sure of her to be eager for her; and
besides, as Bertha slowly improved, Mervyn&rsquo;s prime
attention was lavished on the endeavour to find what would give
her pleasure.&nbsp; And in the sick room, Miss Fennimore and Miss
Charlecote could better rule; while Maria was preferred as a
companion.&nbsp; Honor often admired to see how content
Ph&oelig;be was to forego the privilege of waiting on her sister,
preparing pleasures and comforts for her in the background, and
committing them to the hands whence they would be most welcome,
without a moment&rsquo;s grudge at her own distastefulness to the
patient.&nbsp; She seemed to think it the natural consequence of
the superiority of all the rest, and fully acquiesced.&nbsp;
Sometimes a tear would rise for a moment at Bertha&rsquo;s rude
petulance, but it was dashed off for a resolute smile, as if with
the feeling of a child against tears, and she as plainly felt the
background her natural position, as if she had never been
prominent from circumstances.&nbsp; Whatever was to be done, she
did it, and she was far more grateful to Mervyn for loving Robert
and enduring Maria, than for any preference to herself.&nbsp;
Always finding cause for thanks, she rejoiced even in the delay
caused by Bertha&rsquo;s illness, and in Robert&rsquo;s stay in
his brother&rsquo;s home, where she had scarcely dared to hope
ever to have seen him again.&nbsp; Week after week he remained,
constantly pressed by Mervyn to delay his departure, and not
unwillingly <!-- page 421--><a name="page421"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 421</span>yielding, since he felt that there
was a long arrear of fraternal kindness to be made up, and that
while St. Matthew&rsquo;s was in safe hands, he might justly
consider that his paramount duty was to his brother and sisters
in their present need.&nbsp; At length, however, the Lent
services claimed him in London, and affairs at Beauchamp were so
much mended, that Ph&oelig;be owned that they ought no longer to
detain him from his parish, although Bertha was only able to be
lifted to a couch, took little notice of any endeavour to
interest her, and when he bade her farewell, hardly raised eye or
hand in return.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>
<blockquote><p>When all is done or said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In th&rsquo; end this shall you find,<br />
He most of all doth bathe in bliss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hath a quiet mind.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Lord Vaux</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert had promised to return in the end of March to be
present at the Assizes, when the burglars would be tried, and he
did not come alone.&nbsp; Mr. Crabbe judged it time to inspect
Beauchamp and decide for his wards; and Lady Bannerman, between
Juliana&rsquo;s instigations, her own pride in being connected
with a trial, and her desire to appropriate Ph&oelig;be, decided
on coming down with the Admiral to see how matters stood, and to
give her vote in the family council.</p>
<p>Commissions from Mervyn had pursued Robert since his arrival
in town, all for Bertha&rsquo;s amusement, and he brought down,
by special orders, a musical-box, all Leech&rsquo;s
illustrations, and a small Maltese dog, like a spun-glass lion,
which Augusta had in vain proposed to him to exchange for her
pug, which was getting fat and wheezy, and &lsquo;would amuse
Bertha just as well.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lady Bannerman hardly contained
her surprise when Maria, as well as Mervyn and Ph&oelig;be, met
her in the hall, seemingly quite tame and at her ease.&nbsp;
Mervyn looked better, and in answer to inquiries for Bertha,
answered, &lsquo;Oh, getting on, decidedly; we have her in the
garden.&nbsp; She might drive out, only she has such a horror of
meeting any one; but her spirits are better, I really thought she
would have laughed yesterday when Maria was playing with the
kitten.&nbsp; Ha! the dog, have you got him, Robert.&nbsp; Well,
if this does not amuse her, I do not know what will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at the first possible moment, Mervyn, Maria, and the
Maltese were off through the open window.&nbsp; Robert asked what
Ph&oelig;be thought of Mervyn.&nbsp; She said he was much
stronger, but the doctor was not satisfied that the mischief was
removed, and feared that a little want of care or any excitement
might bring on another attack.&nbsp; She dreaded the morrow on
his account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the elder sister, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
wonder!&nbsp; A most atrocious attempt!&nbsp; I declare I could
hardly make up my mind to sleep in the house!&nbsp; Mind you
swear to them all, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 422--><a name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
422</span>&lsquo;I only saw Smithson clearly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind; if they have not done that, they have
done something quite as bad; and I should never sleep a night
again in peace if they got off.&nbsp; Was it true that they had
packed up all the liqueurs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be exonerated them from this aggravated guilt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, my dear, would you tell the butler to bring up
some of the claret that was bought at Mr. Rollestone&rsquo;s
auction.&nbsp; I told Sir Nicholas that he should taste it, and I
don&rsquo;t like to mention it to poor Mervyn, as he must not
drink wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is some up,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;Mervyn fancies that Bertha liked it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, you don&rsquo;t give Bertha that claret! you
don&rsquo;t know what poor papa gave for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Bertha would only enjoy anything, Mervyn would be
overjoyed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is as Juliana says; it is nothing but spoiling
that ails her,&rsquo; said Augusta.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you say she
was in the garden?&nbsp; I may as well go and see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This Ph&oelig;be withstood with entreating looks, and
representations that Bertha had as yet seen no fresh face, and
was easily startled; but her sister insisted that she was no
stranger, and could do no harm, till Ph&oelig;be had no choice
but to run on and announce her, in the hope that surprise might
lessen the period of agitation.</p>
<p>In the sunniest and most sheltered walk was a wheeled chair
over which Miss Fennimore held a parasol, while Mervyn and Maria
were anxiously trying to win some token of pleasure from the
languid, inanimate occupant to whom they were displaying the
little dog.&nbsp; As the velvet-bordered silk, crimson shawl, and
purple bonnet neared the dark group, a nervous tremor shot
through the sick girl&rsquo;s frame, and partly starting up, she
made a gesture of scared entreaty; but Lady Bannerman&rsquo;s
portly embrace and kind inquiries were not to be averted.&nbsp;
She assured the patient that all was well since she could get out
of doors, the air would give her a famous appetite, and if she
was able to drink claret, she would be strong enough in a day or
two to come up to Juliana in London, where change and variety
would set her up at once.</p>
<p>Bertha scarcely answered, but made an imperious sign to be
drawn to the west wing, and as Ph&oelig;be succeeded in turning
Augusta&rsquo;s attention to the hothouses Mervyn beckoned to
Robert, rather injudiciously, for his patient was still tremulous
from the first greeting.&nbsp; Her face had still the strangely
old appearance, her complexion was nearly white, her hair thin
and scanty, the almost imperceptible cast of the eye which had
formerly only served to give character to her arch expression,
had increased to a decided blemish; and her figure which had shot
up to woman&rsquo;s height, seemed to bend like a reed as Mervyn
supported her to the sofa in the school-room.&nbsp; With nervous
<!-- page 423--><a name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
423</span>fright she retained his hand, speaking with such long,
helpless hesitation that Robert caught only the words
&lsquo;Juliana&mdash;never&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, never,&rsquo; answered Mervyn;
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t fear!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll prevent that, Robert;
tell her that she shall not fall into Juliana&rsquo;s
hands&mdash;no, nor do anything against her will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Only after repeated assurances from both brothers that Augusta
should not carry her off in her present state, did she rest
tranquilly on the sofa, while Mervyn after waiting on her
assiduously, with touching tenderness, as if constantly imploring
her to be pleased, applied himself to playing with the dog,
watching her face for some vestige of interest, and with so much
gratification at the slightest sign of amusement as to show how
melancholy must have been the state compared with which this was
improvement.</p>
<p>After slowly attaining her present amount of convalescence,
she had there stopped short, without progress in strength or
spirits, and alarms constantly varying for her head, spine, and
lungs, as if the slightest accidental cause might fix permanent
disease in either quarter; and to those who daily watched her,
and knew the miserable effects produced by the merest trifles, it
was terrible to think that her destination was in the hands of a
comparative stranger, urged on by the dull Augusta and the acid
Juliana.&nbsp; Mervyn needed no severer penalty for having
forfeited his right to protect his sisters; attached to them and
devoted to Bertha as the anxieties of the spring had rendered
him.&nbsp; The sight of Bertha had so far modified Lady
Bannerman&rsquo;s scheme, that she proposed herself to conduct
the three to Brighton, and there remain till the London season,
when the two younger could be disposed of in some
boarding-school, and Ph&oelig;be conducted to
Albury-street.&nbsp; Mr. Crabbe did not appear averse to this
offer, and there was a correctness about it which rendered it
appalling to those who had not Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s quiet trust
that no part of it would be allowed to happen unless it were good
for them.&nbsp; And she found her eldest brother so much subdued
and less vituperative, that she thought him quite obliged by her
experienced counsel on his housekeeping and cookery, breaking up
his present establishment and letting the house for a year,
during which she promised him all facilities for meeting a young
widow, the wealth of whose stockbroking husband would be exactly
what his business and estate required, and would pay off all his
debts.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be saw indications on Mervyn&rsquo;s countenance
which made it no surprise that he was in such a condition in the
morning that only copious loss of blood and the most absolute
rest to the last moment enabled him to go to W--- for the
trial.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote had undertaken the care of Bertha,
that Miss Fennimore might take charge of Maria, who was
exceedingly eager to see her brother and sister give
evidence.</p>
<p>There is no need to dwell on the proceedings.&nbsp; It was to
Ph&oelig;be on a larger scale what she had previously gone
through.&nbsp; <!-- page 424--><a name="page424"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 424</span>She was too much occupied with the
act before God and her neighbour to be self-conscious, or to
think of the multitudes eagerly watching her young simple face,
or listening to her grave clear tones.&nbsp; A dim perception
crossed Lady Bannerman&rsquo;s mind that there really might be
something in little Ph&oelig;be when she found the
sheriff&rsquo;s wife, the <i>grande dame</i> of the hunting
field, actually shedding tears of emotion.</p>
<p>As soon as Mervyn&rsquo;s own evidence had been given he had
been obliged to go to the inn and lie down; and Ph&oelig;be
wished to join him there and go home at once.&nbsp; Both Robert
and Sir John Raymond were waiting for her at the door of the
witness-box, and the latter begged to introduce the sheriff, who
pressed her to let him take her back into court to Lady
Bannerman, his wife wished so much to see her there and at
luncheon.&nbsp; And when Ph&oelig;be declared that she must
return to her brother, she was told that it had been settled that
she was to come with Sir Nicholas and Lady Bannerman to dine and
sleep at the sheriff&rsquo;s next day, after the assize was over,
to meet the judges.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was almost desperate in her refusals, and was so
little believed after all, that she charged Robert&mdash;when the
sheriff had taken leave&mdash;to assure Augusta of the
impossibility of her accepting the invitation.&nbsp; Sir John
smiled, saying, &lsquo;Lady Caroline scarcely deserved
her,&rsquo; and added, &lsquo;Here is another who wishes to shake
hands with you, and this time I promise that you shall not be
persecuted&mdash;my brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a thin, spare man, who might have been taken for the
elder brother, with a gentle, dreamy expression and soft, tender
voice, such as she could not imagine being able to cope with
pupils.&nbsp; He asked after her brother&rsquo;s health, and she
offered to ascertain whether Mervyn felt well enough to see him,
but he thanked her, saying it was better not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It could not have been his doing,&rsquo; thought
Ph&oelig;be, as she went up-stairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
strong-minded Cecily must be!&nbsp; I wonder whether she would
have done Bertha good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose voice was that?&rsquo; exclaimed Mervyn, at his
door above.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir John Raymond and his brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they coming in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; they thought it might disturb you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was glad that these answers fell to the share of
the unconscious Robert.&nbsp; Mervyn sat down, and did not revert
to the Raymonds through all the homeward journey.&nbsp; Indeed,
he seemed unequal to speaking at all, went to his room
immediately, and did not appear again when the others came home,
bringing tidings that the verdict was guilty, and the sentence
penal servitude.&nbsp; Lady Bannerman had further made a positive
engagement with the sheriff&rsquo;s lady, and was at first
incredulous, then highly displeased, at Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
refusal to be included in it.&nbsp; She was sure it was only that
Ph&oelig;be was bent on her own way, and thought she should get
it when left at home with her guardian and her brothers.</p>
<p><!-- page 425--><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
425</span>Poor Ph&oelig;be, she did not so much as know what her
own way was!&nbsp; She had never so much wished for her
<i>wise</i> guardian, but in the meantime the only wisdom she
could see was to wait patiently, and embrace whatever proposal
would seem best for the others, though with little hope that any
would not entail pain and separation from those who could spare
her as ill as she could spare them.</p>
<p>Dr. Martyn was to come over in the course of the ensuing day
to examine Bertha, and give her guardian his opinion of her
state.&nbsp; There was little danger of its being favourable to
violent changes, for Augusta made a descent on the school-room
after dinner, and the morbid agitation thus occasioned obliged
Miss Fennimore to sit up with the patient till one
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; In the morning the languor was extreme, and
the cough so frequent that the fear for the lungs was in the
ascendant.</p>
<p>But Augusta, knowing of all this, believed her visit to have
been most important, and immediately after breakfast summoned
Robert to a conference, that he might be convinced that there
must be no delay in taking measures for breaking up the present
system.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must hear what Dr. Martyn says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never thought anything of Dr. Martyn since he advised
me to leave off wine at supper.&nbsp; As Juliana says, a
physician can always be taken in by an artful woman, and he is
playing into her hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Into whose?&rsquo; said Robert, unable to suppose it
could be Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Robert, you ought not to let yourself be so
blinded.&nbsp; I am sure it is more for your interest than my
own, but I see you are as simple as ever.&nbsp; Juliana said any
one could hoodwink you by talking of altar-cloths and
Anglo-Saxons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anglo-Catholics, possibly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is all the same!&nbsp; It is those nonsensical
distinctions, rather than your own interests; but when you are
cut out, and depend upon it, she will lose no time in his state
of health&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of whom or what are you talking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never thought well of her, pretending to drink
nothing but water; and with that short, dry way, that I call
impertinence; but I never thought she could be so lost till last
night!&nbsp; Why, when I thought I would just go and see how the
child was&mdash;there, after calling himself too ill to come in
to dinner, there sat Mervyn, actually drinking tea.&nbsp; I
promise you they looked disconcerted!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well they might be!&nbsp; Bertha suffered half the
night from that sudden visit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you believe that, Robert!&nbsp; Well! it is a
convenient blind!&nbsp; But if you won&rsquo;t, we shall do our
best to shame them, and if she dares it, we shall never visit
her!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her drift here becoming revealed to Robert, his uncontrollable
smile caused Augusta to swell with resentment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aye!
<!-- page 426--><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
426</span>nothing on earth will make you own yourself mistaken,
or take the advice of your elders, though you might have had
enough of upholding Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s wilfulness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do you want me to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To join us all in seeing that Miss Fennimore leaves the
house before us.&nbsp; Then I will take the girls to Brighton,
and you and the Actons might keep watch over him, and if he
should persist in his infatuation&mdash;why, in the state of his
head, it would almost come to a commission of lunacy.&nbsp;
Juliana said so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt of it,&rsquo; said Robert,
gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am obliged to you both, Augusta.&nbsp; As
you observe, I am the party chiefly concerned, therefore I have a
right to request that you will leave me to defend my interests as
I shall see best, and that you will confide your surmise to no
one else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert was not easily gainsaid when he spoke in that tone, and
besides, Augusta really was uncertain whether he did not
seriously adopt her advice; but though silenced towards him, she
did not abstain from lamenting herself to Miss Charlecote, who
had come by particular request to consult with Dr. Martyn, and
enforce his opinion on Mr. Crabbe.&nbsp; Honora settled the
question by a laugh, and an assurance that Mervyn had views in
another direction; but Augusta knew of so many abortive schemes
for him, and believed him to be the object of so many reports,
that she treated this with disdain, and much amused Honora by her
matronly superiority and London patronage.</p>
<p>Dr. Martyn came to luncheon, and she endeavoured to extort
from him that indulgence hurt Bertha, and that Mervyn needed
variety.&nbsp; Failing in this, she remembered his anti-supper
advice, and privately warned Mr. Crabbe against him.</p>
<p>His advice threw a new light on the matter.&nbsp; He thought
that in a few weeks&rsquo; time, Bertha ought to be taken to
Switzerland, and perhaps spend the winter in the south of
France.&nbsp; Travelling gave the best hope of rousing her
spirits or bracing her shattered constitution, but the utmost
caution against fatigue and excitement would be requisite; she
needed to be at once humoured and controlled, and her morbid
repugnance to new attendants must be respected till it should
wear off of its own accord.</p>
<p>Surely this might be contrived between sister, governess, and
German nurse, and if Mr. Fulmort himself would go too, it would
be the best thing for his health, which needed exemption from
business and excitement.</p>
<p>Here was playing into the governess&rsquo;s hands!&nbsp;
Mindful of Juliana&rsquo;s injunctions, Lady Bannerman announced
her intention of calling heaven and earth together rather than
sanction the impropriety, and set off for her party at the
sheriff&rsquo;s in a mood which made Ph&oelig;be tremble lest the
attractions of ortolans and Burgundy should instigate the
&lsquo;tremendous sacrifice&rsquo; of becoming chaperon.</p>
<p>Mervyn thought the doctor&rsquo;s sentence conclusive as to
Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s plans, but to his consternation it made no
change <!-- page 427--><a name="page427"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 427</span>in them, except that she fixed the
departure of the family as the moment of parting.&nbsp; Though
her manner towards him had become open and friendly, she was deaf
to all that he could urge, declaring that it was her duty to
leave his sisters, and that the change, when once made, would be
beneficial to Bertha, by removing old associations.&nbsp; In
despair, he came to Miss Charlecote, begging her to try her
powers of persuasion for the sake of poor Bertha, now his primary
object, whom he treated with spoiling affection.&nbsp; He was
quite powerless to withstand any fancy of Bertha in her present
state, and not only helpless without Miss Fennimore, but having
become so far used to her that for his own sake he could not
endure the notion of a substitute.&nbsp; &lsquo;Find out the
objection,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that at least I may know
whether to punch Augusta&rsquo;s head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora gratified him by seeking an interview with the
governess, though not clear herself as to the right course, and
believing that her advice, had she any to give, would go for very
little with the learned governess.&nbsp; Miss Fennimore was soft
and sad, but decided, and begging to be spared useless
arguments.&nbsp; Whether Lady Bannerman had insulted her by
hinting her suspicions, Honor could not divine, for she was
firmly entrenched within her previous motive, namely, that it
would be wrong to remain in a family where first her system, and
then her want of vigilance, had produced such results.&nbsp; And
to the representation that for her own sake the present
conjuncture was the worst in which she could depart, she replied
that it mattered not, since she saw her own deficiencies too
plainly ever to undertake again the charge of young ladies, and
only intended to find employment as a teacher in a school.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say no more,&rsquo; she entreated; &lsquo;and above all
do not let Ph&oelig;be persuade me,&rsquo; and there were tears
on either cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I believe her not having done so is a most
unselfish act of deference to your judgment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it for a sign of true affection!&nbsp; You, who
know what she is, can guess what it costs me to leave her above
all, now that I am one in faith with her, and could talk to her
more openly than I ever dared to do; she whose example first
showed me that faith is a living substance!&nbsp; Yes, Miss
Charlecote, I am to be received into the Church at St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s, where I shall be staying, as soon as I have left
Beauchamp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Overcome with feeling, Honora hastily rose and kissed the
governess&rsquo;s forehead, her tears choking her
utterance.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&mdash;but,&rsquo; she presently said,
&lsquo;that removes all possible doubt.&nbsp; Does not Robert say
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore; &lsquo;but I
cannot think so.&nbsp; After having miserably infused my own
temper of rationalism, how could I, as a novice and learner,
fitly train that poor child?&nbsp; Besides, others of the family
justly complain of me, and I <i>will</i> not be forced on
them.&nbsp; No, nor let my newly-won blessing be alloyed by
bringing me any present advantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 428--><a name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
428</span>&lsquo;I honour you&mdash;I agree with you,&rsquo; said
Miss Charlecote, sadly; &lsquo;but it makes me the more sorry for
those poor girls.&nbsp; I do not see what is to be done!&nbsp; A
stranger will be worse than no one to both the invalids; Lieschen
has neither head nor nerve; and though I do not believe
Ph&oelig;be will ever give way, Bertha behaves very ill to her,
and the strain of anxiety may be too much for such a mere girl,
barely twenty!&nbsp; She may suffer for it afterwards, if not at
the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel it all,&rsquo; sighed Miss Fennimore; &lsquo;but
it would not justify me in letting myself be thrust on a family
whose confidence in me has been deceived.&nbsp; Nobody could go
with them but you, Miss Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me! how much obliged Mervyn would be,&rsquo; laughed
Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a wild wish, such as crosses the mind in moments
of perplexity and distress; but no one else could be so welcome
to my poor Bertha, nor be the motherly friend they all
require.&nbsp; Forgive me, Miss Charlecote; but I have seen what
you made of Ph&oelig;be, in spite of me and my system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Honor returned to announce the ill-success of her
mission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Mervyn; &lsquo;goodness knows what
will become of us!&nbsp; Bertha would go into fits at the sight
of any stranger; and such a hideous old catamaran as Juliana will
be sure to have in pickle, will be the death of her
outright.&nbsp; I think Miss Charlecote had better take pity on
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mervyn, impossible!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be,
shocked at his audacity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I protest,&rsquo; said Mervyn, &lsquo;nothing else can
save you from some nasty, half-bred companion!&nbsp; Faugh!&nbsp;
Now, Miss Charlecote would enjoy the trip, put Maria and Bertha
to bed, and take you to operas, and pictures, and churches, and
you would all be off my hands!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Mervyn,&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, crimson at
his cavalier manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the second such compliment I have received,
Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Fennimore does
me the honour to tell me to be her substitute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if she says so,&rsquo; said Mervyn, &lsquo;it is
our only rescue!&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Honor laughed it was not that she did not think.&nbsp; As
she crossed the park, she felt that each bud of spring beauty,
each promised crop, each lamb, each village child, made the
proposal the more unwelcome; yet that the sense of being rooted,
and hating to move, ought to be combated.&nbsp; It might hardly
be treating Humfrey&rsquo;s &lsquo;goodly heritage&rsquo; aright,
to make it an excuse for abstaining from an act of love; and
since Brooks attended to her so little when at home, he could
very well go on without her.&nbsp; Not that she believed that she
should be called on to decide.&nbsp; She did not think Mervyn in
earnest, nor suppose that he would encumber himself with a
companion who could not be set aside like a governess, and was of
an age more &lsquo;proper&rsquo; and efficient than
agreeable.&nbsp; His unceremonious manner proved sufficiently
that it was a mere joke, and he would <!-- page 429--><a
name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 429</span>probably
laugh his loud, scoffing laugh at the old maid taking him in
earnest.&nbsp; Yet she could not rid herself of the thought of
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s difficulties, and in poor Bertha, she had the
keen interest of nurse towards patient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once before,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;have I gone out
of the beaten track upon impulse.&nbsp; Cruel consequences!&nbsp;
Yet do I repent?&nbsp; Not of the act, but of the error that
ensued.&nbsp; Then I was eager, young, romantic.&nbsp; Now I
would rather abstain: I am old and sluggish.&nbsp; If it is to
be, it will be made plain.&nbsp; I do not distrust my feeling for
Ph&oelig;be&mdash;it is not the jealous, hungering love of old;
and I hope to be able to discern whether this be an act of
charity!&nbsp; At least, I will not take the initiative.&nbsp; I
did so last time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor&rsquo;s thoughts and speculations were all at Beauchamp
throughout the evening and the early morning, till her avocations
drove it out of her mind.&nbsp; She was busy, trying hard to get
her own way with her bailiff as to the crops, when she was
interrupted by tidings that Mr. Fulmort was in the drawing-room;
and concluding it to be Robert, she did not hurry her argument
upon guano.&nbsp; On entering the room, however, she was amazed
at beholding not Robert, but his brother, cast down in an
armchair, and looking thoroughly tired out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn!&nbsp; I did not expect to see you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I just walked over.&nbsp; I thought I would report
progress.&nbsp; I had no notion it was so far.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And in fact he had not been at the Holt since, as a pert boy,
he had found it &lsquo;slow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Honor was rather
alarmed at his fatigue, and offered varieties of sustenance,
which he declined, returning with eager nervousness to the
subject in hand.</p>
<p>The Bannermans, he said, had offered to go with Bertha and
Ph&oelig;be, but only on condition that Maria was left at a
boarding-house, and a responsible governess taken for
Bertha.&nbsp; Moreover, Augusta had told Bertha herself what was
impending, and the poor child had laid a clinging, trembling
grasp on his arm, and hoarsely whispered that if a stranger came
to hear her story, she would die.&nbsp; Alas! it might be easier
than before.&nbsp; He had promised never to consent.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But what can I do?&rsquo; he said, with a hand upon either
temple; &lsquo;they heed me no more than Maria!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert had absolutely half consented to leave his cure in the
charge of another, and conduct his brother and sisters, but this
plan did not satisfy the guardian, who could not send out his
wards without some reliable female.</p>
<p>He swung the tassel of the sofa-cushion violently as he spoke,
and looked imploringly at Honora, but she, though much moved,
felt obliged to keep her resolution of not beginning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very hard,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that when there are
but two women in the world that that poor child likes, she can
have neither!&rsquo; and then, gaining hope from something in her
face, he exclaimed, &lsquo;After all, I do believe you will take
pity on her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you in joke yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it too good to be true!&nbsp; I am not so
cool as Ph&oelig;be <!-- page 430--><a name="page430"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 430</span>thought me.&nbsp; But really,&rsquo;
he said, assuming an earnest, rational, gentlemanly manner,
&lsquo;you have done so much for us that perhaps it makes us
presume, and though I know it is preposterous, yet if it were
possible to you to be long enough with poor Bertha to bring her
round again, I do believe it would make an infinite
difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does Ph&oelig;be say?&rsquo; asked Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, poor child, she does not know I am
come.&nbsp; She looks as white as death, and got up a smile that
was enough to make one cry, but she told me not to mind, for
something would be sure to bring it right; and so it will, if you
will come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mervyn, you don&rsquo;t consider what a nuisance I
shall be to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn looked more gallant than Robert ever could have done,
and said something rather foolish; but anxiety quickly made him
natural again, and he proceeded, &lsquo;After all, they need not
bother you much.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be is of your own sort, and Maria
is inoffensive, and Bertha will have Lieschen, and
I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take my own line, and be as little of a bore
as I can.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If&mdash;if it will do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That odd answer was enough.&nbsp; Mervyn, already leaning
forward with his arms on his knees, held out one hand, and shaded
his eyes with the other, as, half with a sob, he said,
&lsquo;There, then, it is all right!&nbsp; Miss Charlecote, you
can&rsquo;t guess what it is to a man not to be trusted with his
own sisters!&rsquo;</p>
<p>These words made that <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>, John Mervyn
Fulmort, nearly as much a child of her own as his brother and
sister; for they were in a tone of self-blame&mdash;not of
resentment.</p>
<p>She was sufficiently afraid of him to respect his reserve;
moreover, he looked so ill and harassed that she dreaded his
having an attack, and heartily wished for Ph&oelig;be, so she
only begged him to rest till after her early dinner, when she
would convey him back to Beauchamp; and then left him alone,
while she went to look her undertaking in the face, rather amused
to find herself his last resource, and surprised to find her
spirit of enterprise rising, her memories of Alps, lakes,
cathedrals, and pictures fast assuming the old charm that had
erst made her long to see them again.&nbsp; And with
Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; Really it would be almost a disappointment if
the scheme failed.</p>
<p>When she again met her unwonted guest he plunged into plans,
routes, and couriers, treating her as far more completely pledged
than she chose to allow; and eating as heartily as he dared, and
more so than she thought Ph&oelig;be would approve.&nbsp; She was
glad to have him safe at his own door, where Ph&oelig;be ran to
meet them, greatly relieved, for she had been much disturbed by
his absence at luncheon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote!&nbsp; Did you meet him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went after her&rsquo;&mdash;and Mervyn boyishly
caught his sister round the waist, and pushed her down into a
curtsey&mdash;&lsquo;make your obedience; she is going to look
after you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 431--><a name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
431</span>&lsquo;Going with us!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, with
clasped hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see about it,&rsquo; began Honor, but the words were
strangled in a transported embrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dearest, dearest Miss Charlecote!&nbsp; Oh, I knew it
would all come right if we were patient; but, oh! that it should
be so right!&nbsp; Oh! Mervyn, how could you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you see what it is not to be
faint-hearted.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Ph&oelig;be, whose fault was
certainly not a faint heart, laughed at this poor jest, as she
had seldom laughed before, with an <i>abandon</i> of gaiety and
joyousness.&nbsp; The quiet girl was absolutely thrown off her
balance, laughed and cried, thanked and exclaimed, moved
restlessly, and spoke incoherently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! may I tell Bertha?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll do that,&rsquo; said Mervyn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is all my doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Run after him, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Honor.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let Bertha think it settled!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Bertha was, of course, disappointingly indifferent.</p>
<p>Lady Bannerman&rsquo;s nature was not capable of great
surprise, but Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s proposal was not
unwelcome.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not want to go,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;though dear Sir Nicholas would have made any sacrifice,
and it would have looked so for them to have gone alone.&nbsp;
Travelling with an invalid is so trying, and Ph&oelig;be made
such a rout about Maria, that Mr. Crabbe insisted on her
going.&nbsp; But you like the kind of thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor undertook for her own taste for the kind of thing, and
her ladyship continued, &lsquo;Yes, you must find it uncommonly
dull to be so much alone.&nbsp; Where did Juliana tell me she had
heard of Lucy Sandbrook?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is in Staffordshire,&rsquo; answered Honor,
gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes, with Mrs. Willis Beaumont; I remember.&nbsp;
Juliana made a point of letting her know all about it, and how
you were obliged to give her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; exclaimed Honor, alarmed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I never gave her up!&nbsp; There is no cause but her own
spirit of independence that she should not return to me
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed,&rsquo; said Augusta, carelessly letting the
subject drop, after having implanted anxiety too painful to be
quelled by the hope that Lady Acton&rsquo;s neighbourhood might
have learnt how to rate her words.</p>
<p>Mr. Crabbe was satisfied and complimentary; Robert, rejoiced
and grateful; and Bertha, for the first time, set her will upon
recovering, and made daily experiments on her strength, thus
quickly amending, though still her weakness and petulance needed
the tenderest management, and once when a doubt arose as to Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s being able to leave home, she suddenly
withered up again, with such a recurrence of unfavourable
symptoms as proved how precarious was her state.</p>
<p>It was this evidence of the necessity of the arrangement that
chiefly contributed to bring it to pass.&nbsp; When the pressure
of difficulty lessened, Mervyn was half ashamed of his own <!--
page 432--><a name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
432</span>conquest, disliked the obligation, and expected to be
bored by &lsquo;the old girl,&rsquo; as, to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
intense disgust, he <i>would</i> speak of Miss Charlecote.&nbsp;
Still, in essentials he was civil and considerate, and Honor
carefully made it evident that she did not mean to obtrude
herself, and expected him to sit loose to the female part of the
company.&nbsp; Divining that he would prefer the start from home
not to be simultaneous, and also favouring poor Bertha&rsquo;s
shuddering horror of the direct line of railway to London, she
proposed that the ladies should work their way by easy journeys
on cross lines to Southampton, whilst Mervyn settled his affairs
at the office, and then should come to them with Robert, who had
made it possible to take an Easter holiday in which to see them
safe to their destination in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to acquiesce in Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s
advice to trust Mervyn&rsquo;s head to Robert&rsquo;s charge, and
not tease him with solicitude; but the being debarred from going
to London was a great disappointment.&nbsp; She longed for a
sight of St. Matthew&rsquo;s; and what would it not have been to
see the two brothers there like brothers indeed?&nbsp; But she
must be content with knowing that so it was.&nbsp; Mervyn&rsquo;s
opposition was entirely withdrawn, and though he did not in the
least comprehend and was far from admiring his brother&rsquo;s
aims, still his name and his means were no longer withheld from
supporting Robert&rsquo;s purposes, &lsquo;because he was such a
good fellow, it was a shame to stand in his way.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
knew, too, rather by implication than confession, that Mervyn
imagined his chief regrets for the enormous extravagance of the
former year, were because he had thus deprived himself of the
power of buying a living for his brother, as compensation for
having kept him out of his father&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; Whether
Mervyn would ever have made the purchase, and still more whether
Robert would have accepted it, was highly doubtful, but the
intention was a step for which to be thankful; and Ph&oelig;be
watched the growing friendliness of the long estranged pair with
constantly new delight, and anticipated much from Mervyn&rsquo;s
sight of St. Matthew&rsquo;s with eyes no longer jaundiced.</p>
<p>She would gladly, too, have delayed the parting with Miss
Fennimore, who had made all her arrangements for a short stay
with her relatives in London, and then for giving lessons at a
school.&nbsp; To Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s loyal spirit, it seemed hard
that even Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s care should be regarded as
compensating for the loss of the home friend of the last seven
years, and the closer, dearer link was made known as she sat late
over the fire with the governess on Easter Sunday evening, their
last at Beauchamp.&nbsp; Silent hitherto, Miss Fennimore held her
peace no longer, but begged Ph&oelig;be to think of one who on
another Sunday would no longer turn aside from the Altar.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be lifted her eyes, full of hope and inquiry, and as she
understood, exclaimed, &lsquo;O, I am glad!&nbsp; I knew you must
have some deep earnest reason for not being with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never guessed?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 433--><a name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
433</span>&lsquo;I never tried.&nbsp; I saw that Robert knew, so
I hoped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And prayed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you belonged to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I belong to you now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, more than ever now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, my child, you never traced my unsettled
faith?&mdash;my habit of testing mystery by reason never
perplexed you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be thought a moment, and said, &lsquo;I knew that
Robert distrusted, though I never asked why.&nbsp; There was a
time when I used to try to sift the evidence and logic of all I
learnt, and I was puzzled where faith&rsquo;s province began and
reasoning ended.&nbsp; But when our first sorrow came, all the
puzzles melted, and it was not worth while to argue on realities
that I felt.&nbsp; Since that, I have read more, and seen where
my own ignorance made my difficulties, and I have
prized&mdash;yes, adored, the truths all the more because you had
taught me to appreciate in some degree their perfect foundation
on reasoning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange,&rsquo; said Miss Fennimore, &lsquo;that we
should have lived together so long, acting on each other, yet
each unconscious of the other&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; I see
now.&nbsp; What to you was not doubt, but desire for a reason for
your hope, became in poor Bertha, not disbelief, but contempt and
carelessness of what she did not feel.&nbsp; I shall never have a
sense of rest, till you can tell me that she enters into your
faith.&nbsp; I am chiefly reconciled to leaving her, because I
trust that in her enfeebled, dependent state, she may become
influenced by Miss Charlecote and by you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot argue with her,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When she is well, she can always puzzle me; I lose her
when she gets to her <i>ego</i>.&nbsp; You are the only one who
can cope with that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very reason for keeping away.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
argue.&nbsp; Live and act.&nbsp; That was your lesson to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be did not perceive, and Miss Fennimore loved her
freedom from self-consciousness too well even for
gratitude&rsquo;s sake to molest her belief that the conversion
was solely owing to Robert&rsquo;s powers of controversy.</p>
<p>That one fleeting glimpse of inner life was the true
farewell.&nbsp; The actual parting was a practical matter of
hurry of trains, and separation of parcels, with Maria too busy
with the Maltese dog to shed tears, or even to perceive that this
was a final leave-taking with one of those whom she best
loved.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
<blockquote><p>Tak down, tak down the mast of gowd,<br />
Set up the mast of tree,<br />
It sets not a forsaken lady<br />
To sail so gallantly.&mdash;<i>Annie of Lochroyan</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Quaint little white-capped objects!&nbsp; The St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s girls marching to St. Paul&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Ah! the
banner I helped to <!-- page 434--><a name="page434"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 434</span>work!&nbsp; How well I remember the
contriving that crozier upon it!&nbsp; How well it has
worn!&nbsp; Sweet Honey must be in London; it was the sight she
most grudged missing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So thought Lucilla Sandbrook as a cab conveyed her through the
Whittingtonian intricacies.</p>
<p>Her residence with Mrs. Willis Beaumont was not a passage in
her life on which she loved to dwell.&nbsp; Neither party had
been well content with the other, though deference to Mrs.
Prendergast had held them together.&nbsp; The lady herself was
worthy and kind-hearted, but dull and tedious; and Lucilla, used
to animation and intellect, had wearied excessively of the
platitudes which were meant as friendly conversation, while her
keen remarks and power of drollery and repartee were just
sufficiently perceived to be dreaded and disliked.&nbsp; The
children were like their mother, and were frightened and
distressed by her quickness and unreasonable expectations.&nbsp;
Their meek, demure heaviness and complacency, even at their
sports, made her positively dislike them, all but one scapegrace
boy, in favour with no one, and whom she liked more from
perverseness and compassion than from any merits of his
own.&nbsp; Lady Acton&rsquo;s good offices gave the widow a
tangible cause, such as was an absolute satisfaction, for her
antipathy, and shook the implicit trust in Mrs.
Prendergast&rsquo;s recommendation that had hitherto overridden
her private sentiments; yet still, habitual awe of her
sister-in-law, and her own easiness and dread of change, left
things in the same state until a crisis caused by a grand
disturbance among the children.&nbsp; In the nice matter of
meting out blame, mamma&rsquo;s partiality and the
children&rsquo;s ungenerosity left an undue share upon the
scapegrace; his indignant partisan fought his battles &lsquo;not
wisely but too well,&rsquo; lost temper, and uttered sarcastic
home truths which startled and stung the lady into the request
for which she could hardly have nerved herself in cooler moments,
namely, that they might part.</p>
<p>This settled, each secretly felt that there was something to
be regretted, and both equally wished that a new engagement
should be made before the termination of the present should be
made known at Southminster.&nbsp; For this purpose, every
facility had been given for Miss Sandbrook&rsquo;s coming to town
personally to answer two ladies to whom she had been
mentioned.&nbsp; A family in the neighbourhood had already been
tried, but had declined her, and Mrs. Beaumont had shown her the
note; &lsquo;so stylish, such strange stories
afloat.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lucilla felt it best to break upon new
ground, and wounded and depressed, had yet resentment enough to
bear her through boldly.&nbsp; She wished to inspect Owen&rsquo;s
child, and wrote to ask Mrs. Murrell to give her a bed for a
couple of nights, venturing on this measure because, in the old
woman&rsquo;s monthly report, she had mentioned that Mr. Fulmort
had gone abroad for a fortnight.</p>
<p>It had not been an exhilarating evening.&nbsp; Small children
<!-- page 435--><a name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
435</span>were not much to Lucilla&rsquo;s taste, and her nephew
was not a flattering specimen.&nbsp; He had the whitened drawn-up
appearance of a child who had spent most of his life in a London
cellar, with a pinched little visage and preternatural-looking
black eyes, a squeaky little fretful voice, and all the language
he had yet acquired decidedly cockney.&nbsp; Moreover, he had the
habits of a spoilt child, and that a vulgar one, and his
grandmother expected his aunt to think him a prodigy.&nbsp; There
was a vacant room where Lucilla passed as much of her time as she
could without an assumption of superiority, but she was obliged
to spend the evening in the small furniture-encumbered parlour,
and hear by turns of her nephew&rsquo;s traits of genius, of the
merits of the preachers in Cat-alley, and the histories of the
lodgers.&nbsp; The motherly Mrs. Murrell had invited any of the
young men whose &lsquo;hearts might be touched&rsquo; to attend
her &lsquo;simple family worship;&rsquo; and to Lucilla&rsquo;s
discomfiture and her triumph, a youth appeared in the evening,
and the young lady had her doubts whether the expounding were the
attraction.</p>
<p>It was a relief to quit the close, underground atmosphere even
for a cab; and &lsquo;an inspecting lady must be better than that
old woman,&rsquo; thought poor Lucy, as, heartily weary of Mrs.
Murrell&rsquo;s tongue and her own graciousness, she rattled
through the streets.&nbsp; Those long ranks of charity children
renewed many an association of old.&nbsp; The festival which had
been the annual event of Honor Charlecote&rsquo;s youth, she had
made the same to her children, and Cilla had not despised it till
recently.&nbsp; Thoughts of better days, of home-feelings, of
tenderness, began to soften her.&nbsp; She had spent nearly two
years without the touch of a kindred hand, and for many months
past had been learning what it was to be looked at by no loving
eye.&nbsp; She was on her way to still greater strangers!&nbsp;
No wonder her heart yearned to the gentle voice that she had once
spurned, and well-nigh in spite of herself, she muttered,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really I do think a kiss of poor Honor&rsquo;s would do
me good!&nbsp; I have a great mind to go to her when I come back
from Kensington.&nbsp; If I have taken a situation she cannot
suppose that I want anything from her.&nbsp; It would be very
comfortable; I should hear of Owen!&nbsp; I will go!&nbsp; Even
if she be not in town, I could talk to Mrs. Jones, and sit a
quarter of an hour in the cedar room!&nbsp; It would be like
meeting Owen; it would be rest and home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt quite happy and pleased with herself under this
resolution, but it was late before she could put it in
practice.&nbsp; The lady at Kensington rather started on entering
the room where she had been waiting nearly an hour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought&mdash;&rsquo; she said, apologetically,
&lsquo;Did my servant say Miss Sandbrook?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla assented, and the lady, a little discomposed, asked a
few questions, furtively surveying her all the time, seemed
confused, then begged her to take some luncheon.&nbsp; It was so
long since Mrs. Murrell&rsquo;s not very tempting breakfast, that
the <!-- page 436--><a name="page436"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 436</span>invitation was welcome, even though
the presence of a gentleman and an elderly lady showed that it
was a pretext for a family inspection, and again she detected the
same start of surprise, and a glance passing round the circle,
such as made her glad when afterwards an excuse was made for
leaving her alone, that she might apply to the glass to see
whether anything were amiss in her dress.</p>
<p>Then first she remarked that hers was not the governess
air.&nbsp; She had long felt very virtuous for having spent
almost nothing on her clothes, eking out her former wardrobe to
the utmost; and the loose, dove-coloured jacket over her black
silk skirt betrayed Parisian make, as did the exquisite rose,
once worn in her hair, and now enlivening the white ribbon and
black lace of the cheap straw bonnet, far back upon the rippling
hair turned back from her temples, and falling in profuse
ringlets.&nbsp; It was her ordinary unpremeditated appearance,
but she perceived that to these good people it was startlingly
stylish, and she was prepared for the confused intimation that
there was no need for entering upon the discussion of terms.</p>
<p>She had been detained too late to make her other call, and the
processions of tired children showed her that the service at St.
Paul&rsquo;s was over.&nbsp; The depression of disappointment
inclined her the more to the loving old face; and she caused
herself to be set down at the end of Woolstone-lane, feeling as
if drawn by a magnet as she passed the well known warehouse
walls, and as if it were home indeed when she reached the court
door.</p>
<p>It would not yield to her intimate manipulation of the old
latch&mdash;a bad sign, and the bell re-echoed in vacancy.&nbsp;
Again and again she rang, each moment of exclusion awakening a
fresh yearning towards the cedar fragrance, every stare of
passer-by making her long for the safe shelter of the
bay-windowed parlour.&nbsp; At last a step approached, and a
greeting for the friendly old servant was on her tongue&rsquo;s
end.&nbsp; Alas! a strange face met her eye, elderly,
respectable, but guarded.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote was not at home,
not in town, not at Hiltonbury&mdash;gone abroad, whither was not
known.&nbsp; Mrs. Jones?&nbsp; Dead more than a year ago.&nbsp;
Every reply was followed by an attempt to close the door, and it
needed all Lucy&rsquo;s native hardihood, all her ardent craving
for her former home, to venture on an entreaty to be admitted for
a few minutes.&nbsp; She was answered, that the house might be
shown to no one without orders from Mr. Parsons.</p>
<p>Her heart absolutely fainted within her, as the heavy door was
closed on her, making her thoroughly realize her voluntary
renunciation of home and protection, and the dreariness of the
world on which she had cast herself.&nbsp; Anxiety on
Honor&rsquo;s behalf began to awaken.&nbsp; Nothing but illness
could have induced her to leave her beloved Holt, and in the
thought of her sick, lonely, and untended by the children she had
<!-- page 437--><a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
437</span>fostered, Cilla forgave her adoption, forgave her
forgiveness, forgave everything, in the impulse to hasten to her
to requite the obligation by the tenderest care.</p>
<p>She had actually set off to the parsonage in quest of
intelligence, when she recollected that she might appear there as
a discarded governess in quest of her offended patroness; and her
pride impelled her to turn back, but she despatched Mrs.
Murrell&rsquo;s little maid with a note, saying that, being in
town for a day, and hearing of Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s absence on
the continent, she could not help begging to be certified that
illness was not the cause.&nbsp; The reply was brief and formal,
and it only altered Lucilla&rsquo;s uneasiness, for Mrs. Parsons
merely assured her of Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s perfect health, and
said she was gone abroad with the Fulmort family, where there had
been a good deal of illness.</p>
<p>In her displeasure and desire to guard Honora from becoming a
prey to the unworthy Sandbrooks, Mrs. Parsons never guessed at
the cruelty of her own words, and at the conclusion drawn from
them.&nbsp; Robert Fulmort likewise absent!&nbsp; No doubt his
health had broken down, and Honor was taking Ph&oelig;be to be
with him!&nbsp; She examined Mrs. Murrell, and heard of his
activity, indeed, but of his recent absences from his parish, and
by and by the good woman bethought her of a report that Mr.
Fulmort was from home on account of his health.&nbsp; Oh, the
misery of not daring to make direct inquiry!</p>
<p>But the hard practical world was before her, and the new
situation was no longer a matter of wilful choice, but of dire
necessity.&nbsp; She would not be hastily thrust from her present
post, and would be lovingly received at Southminster in case of
need, but she had no dependence save on her own exertions, and
perverse romance had died away into desolateness.&nbsp; With
strange, desperate vehemence, and determination not again to
fail, she bought the plainest of cap-fronts, reduced her bonnet
to the severest dowdiness, hid, straightened, tightened the
waving pale gold of her hair, folded her travelling-shawl
old-womanishly, cast aside all the merely ornamental, and
glancing at herself, muttered, &lsquo;I did not know I could be
so insignificant!&rsquo;&nbsp; Little Owen stared as if his
beautiful aunt had lost her identity, and Mrs. Murrell was ready
to embrace her as a convert to last night&rsquo;s exposition.</p>
<p>Perhaps the trouble was wasted, for the lady, Mrs. Bostock,
did not seem to be particular.&nbsp; She was quite young, easily
satisfied, and only eager to be rid of an embarrassing interview
of a kind new to her; the terms were fixed, and before many weeks
had passed Lucilla was settled at a cottage of gentility, in
sight of her Thames, but on the Essex side, where he was not the
same river to her, and she found herself as often thinking that
those tainted waters had passed the garden in Woolstone-lane as
that they had sparkled under Wrapworth Bridge.</p>
<p><!-- page 438--><a name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
438</span>It was the greatest change she had yet undergone.&nbsp;
She was entirely the governess, never the companion of the
elders.&nbsp; Her employers were mercantile, wrapped up in each
other, busy, and gay.&nbsp; The husband was all day in London,
and, when the evenings were not given to society, preferred
spending them alone with his wife and children.&nbsp; In his
absence, the nursery absorbed nearly all the time the mother
could spare from her company and her household.&nbsp; The
children, who were too old for playthings, were consigned to the
first-rate governess, and only appeared in the evening.&nbsp;
Lucilla never left her schoolroom but for a walk, or on a formal
request to appear in the drawing-room at a party; a solitude
which she at first thought preferable to Mrs. Willis
Beaumont&rsquo;s continued small chatter, especially as the
children were pleasant, brisk, and lovable, having been well
broken in by their Swiss <i>bonne</i>.</p>
<p>Necessity had trained Cilly in self-restraint, and the want of
surveillance made her generous nature the more scrupulous in her
treatment of her pupils; she taught them diligently, kept good
order, won their affection and gave them some of her own, but
nothing could obviate her growing weariness of holding
intercourse with no mind above eleven years old.&nbsp; Trouble
and anxiety she had known before, and even the terrible heartache
that she carried about with her might have failed to wear down a
being constituted as she was, without the long solitary evenings,
and the total want of companionship.&nbsp; The first shock had
been borne by the help of bustle and change, and it was only as
weeks passed on, that care and depression grew upon her.&nbsp;
Lessons, walks, children&rsquo;s games were oppressive in turn,
and though the last good-night was a welcome sound, yet the
solitude that ensued was unspeakably forlorn.&nbsp; Reading she
had never loved, even had this been a house of books; the
children were too young to need exertion on her part to keep in
advance of them, and their routine lessons wore out her energies
too much for her to turn to her own resources.&nbsp; She did
little but repair her wardrobe, work for the boy in
Whittington-street, and let thoughts drift through her
mind.&nbsp; That death-bed scene at Hy&egrave;res, which had so
often risen unbidden to her mind as she lay on her crib, was
revived again, but it was not her father whose ebbing life she
watched.&nbsp; It was one for whom she durst not ask, save by an
inquiry from her brother, who had never dropped his
correspondence with Honora; but Owen was actively employed, and
his locality and habits were so uncertain that his letters were
often astray for long together.&nbsp; His third year of
apprenticeship had begun, and Lucilla&rsquo;s sole hope of a
change from her present dreary captivity was in his either
returning with Mr. Currie, or finding employment and sending for
her and his child to Canada.&nbsp; &lsquo;By that time,&rsquo;
she thought, &lsquo;Europe will contain nothing to me.&nbsp; Nay,
what does it contain that I have a right to care for now?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t delude myself.&nbsp; I know his look and
manner.&nbsp; <!-- page 439--><a name="page439"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 439</span>His last thought will be for his
flock at St. Matthew&rsquo;s, not for her who drove him to the
work that has been killing him.&nbsp; Oh, no, he won&rsquo;t even
forgive me, for he will think it the greatest service I could
have done him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her eyes were hot and dry; what a
relief would tears have been!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
<blockquote><p>Enid, my early and my only love,<br />
I thought, but that your father came between,<br />
In former days you saw me favourably,<br />
And if it were so, do not keep it back,<br />
Make me a little happier, let me know it.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Tennyson</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foreign tour proved a great success.&nbsp; The summer in
the Alps was delightful.&nbsp; The complete change gave Bertha
new life, bodily strength first returning, and then mental
activity.&nbsp; The glacier system was a happy exchange for her
<i>ego</i>, and she observed and enjoyed with all the force of
her acute intelligence and spirit of inquiry, while Ph&oelig;be
was happy in doing her duty by profiting by all opportunities of
observation, in taking care of Maria and listening to Mervyn, and
Miss Charlecote enjoyed scenery, poetry, art, and natural objects
with relish keener than even that of her young friends, who were
less impressible to beauty in every shape.</p>
<p>Mervyn behaved very well to her, knowing himself bound to make
the journey agreeable to her; he was constantly kind to Bertha,
and in the pleasure of her revival submitted to a wonderful
amount of history and science.&nbsp; All his grumbling was
reserved for the private ear of Ph&oelig;be, whose privilege it
always was to be his murmuring block, and who was only too
thankful to keep to herself his discontents whenever his route
was not chosen (and often when it was), his disgusts with inns,
railroads, and sights and his impatience of all pursuits save
Bertha&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Many a time she was permitted to see and
hear nothing but how much he was bored, but on the whole the
growls were so mitigated compared with what she had known, that
it was almost contentment; and that he did not absolutely dislike
their habits was plain from his adherence to the ladies, though
he might have been quite independent of them.</p>
<p>Bertha&rsquo;s distortion of eye and hesitation of speech,
though much modified, always recurred from fatigue, excitement,
or meeting with strangers, or&mdash;still worse&mdash;with
acquaintance.&nbsp; The difficulty of utterance distressed her
far more than if she had been subject thereto from infancy, and
increased her exceeding repugnance to any sort of society beyond
her own party.&nbsp; The question whether she were fit to return
home for the winter was under debate, when at Geneva, early in
September, tidings reached the travellers that produced such a
shock as to settle the point.</p>
<p><!-- page 440--><a name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
440</span>Juliana Acton was dead!&nbsp; It had been a very short
attack of actual illness, but disease had long been secretly
preying on her&mdash;and her asperity of disposition might be
accounted for by constant unavowed suffering.&nbsp; It was a
great blow.&nbsp; Her unpleasant qualities were all forgiven in
the dismay of learning what their excuse had been; for those who
have so lived as to make themselves least missed, are perhaps at
the first moment the more mourned by good hearts for that very
cause.</p>
<p>Augusta was so much terrified on her own account, that she
might almost have been made a hydropathist on the spot; and
Robert wrote that poor Sir Bevil was perfectly overwhelmed with
grief and self-reproach, giving himself no credit for his
exemplary patience and forbearance, but bitterly accusing himself
of hardness and neglect.&nbsp; These feelings were shared in some
degree by all the others, and Mervyn was especially
affected.&nbsp; There had been much to soften him since his
parents&rsquo; death, and the sudden loss of the sister with whom
he had always been on terms of scorn and dislike, shocked him
excessively, and drew him closer to the survivors, sobering him,
and silencing his murmurs for the time in real grief and
awe.&nbsp; Bertha likewise was thoroughly overcome, not so much
by these feelings, as by the mere effect of the sudden tidings on
her nervous temperament, and the overclouding of the cheerfulness
that had hitherto surrounded her.&nbsp; This, added to a day of
over-fatigue and exposure, brought back such a recurrence of
unfavourable symptoms, that a return to an English winter was not
to be thought of.&nbsp; The south of France was decided upon at
once, and as Lucilla had truly divined, Honor Charlecote&rsquo;s
impulse led them to Hy&egrave;res, that she might cast at least
one look at the grave in the Stranger&rsquo;s corner of the
cypress-grown burial-ground, where rested the beloved of her
early days, the father of the darlings of her widowed
heart&mdash;loved and lost.</p>
<p>She endured her absence from home far better than she had
expected, so much easier was it to stay away than to set off, and
so completely was she bound up with her companions, loving
Ph&oelig;be like a parent, and the other two like a nurse, and
really liking the brother.&nbsp; All took delight in the winter
paradise of Hy&egrave;res, that fragment of the East set down
upon the French coast, and periodically peopled with a motley
multitude of visitors from all the lands of Europe, all invalids,
or else attendants on invalids.</p>
<p>Bertha still shrank from all contact with society, and the
ladies, for her sake, lived entirely apart; but Mervyn made
acquaintance, and sometimes went out on short expeditions with
other gentlemen, or to visit his mercantile correspondents at
Marseilles, or other places on the coast.</p>
<p>It was while he was thus absent that the three sisters stood
one afternoon on the paved terrace of the <i>Hotel des Isles
d&rsquo;Or</i>, which rose behind them, in light coloured stone,
of a kind of <!-- page 441--><a name="page441"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 441</span>Italian-looking architecture,
commanding a lovely prospect, the mountains on the Toulon side,
though near, melting into vivid blue, and white cloud wreaths
hanging on their slopes.&nbsp; In front lay the plain, covered
with the peculiar gray-tinted olive foliage, overtopped by date
palms, and sloping up into rounded hills covered with dark pines,
the nearest to the sea bearing on its crest the Church <i>de
l&rsquo;Ermitage</i>.&nbsp; The sea itself was visible beyond the
olives, bordered by a line of <i>&eacute;tangs</i> or pools, and
white heaps of salt, and broken by a peninsula and the three
Isles d&rsquo;Or.&nbsp; It was a view of which Bertha seemed
never able to have enough, and she was always to be found gazing
at it when the first ready for a walk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you going to sketch, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; she
said, as the sisters joined her.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can you, on
such a day as this, with the air, as it were, loaded with
cheiranthus smell?&nbsp; It makes one lazy to think of
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to be a duty to preserve some remembrance of
this beautiful place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be a pity to miss it, but as for the
duty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, not to give pleasure at home, and profit by
opportunities?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too hard to carry about an embodiment of Miss
Fennimore&rsquo;s rules!&nbsp; Why, have you no individuality,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must I not sketch, then?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very welcome, if you would do it for your
pleasure, not as an act of bondage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not as bondage,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;it is
only because I ought that I care to do so at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s the reason you only make maps of the
landscape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was quite true that Ph&oelig;be had no accomplished turn,
and what had been taught her she only practised as a duty to the
care and cost expended on it, and these were things where
&lsquo;all her might&rsquo; was no equivalent for a spark of
talent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ought&rsquo; alone gave her the zest that
Bertha would still have found in &lsquo;ought not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all I can do,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and Miss
Fennimore may like to see them; so, Bertha, I shall continue to
carry the sketchbook by which the English woman is known like the
man by his &ldquo;Murray.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Charlecote has
letters to write, so we must go out by ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Proven&ccedil;al natives of Hy&egrave;res had little
liking for the foreigners who thronged their town, but did not
molest them, and ladies walked about freely in the lovely
neighbourhood, so that Honor had no scruple in sending out her
charges, unaccompanied except by Lieschen, in case the two others
might wish to dispose of Maria, while they engaged in some
pursuit beyond her powers.</p>
<p>Poor Lieschen, a plump Prussian, grown portly on Beauchamp
good living, had little sympathy with the mountain tastes of her
frauleins, and would have wished all Hy&egrave;res like the shelf
on <!-- page 442--><a name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
442</span>the side of the hill where stood their hotel, whence
the party set forth for the Place des Palmiers, so called from
six actual palms bearing, but not often ripening, dates.&nbsp;
Two sides were enclosed by houses, on a third an orange garden
sloped down the descent; the fourth, where the old town climbed
straight up the hill, was regarded by poor Lieschen with dread,
and she vainly persuaded Maria at least to content herself with
joining the collection of natives resting on the benches beneath
the palms.&nbsp; How willingly would the good German have
produced her knitting, and sought a compatriot among the nurses
who sat gossiping and embroidering, while Maria might have played
among their charges, who were shovelling about, or pelting each
other with the tiny white sea-washed pebbles that thickly strewed
the place.</p>
<p>But Maria, with the little Maltese dog in her arms, to guard
him from a hailstorm of the pebbles, was inexorably bent on
following her sisters; and Bertha had hurried nervously across
from the strangers, so that Lieschen must pursue those light
steps through the winding staircase streets, sometimes consisting
of broad shallow steps, sometimes of actual flights of steep
stairs hewn out in the rock, leading to a length of level
terrace, where, through garden gates, orange trees looked out,
dividing the vantage ground with houses and rocks&mdash;up
farther, past the almost desolate old church of St.
Paul&mdash;farther again&mdash;till, beyond all the houses, they
came forth on the open mountainside, with a crest of rock far
above, surmounted by the ruins of a castle, said to have been
fortified by the Saracens, and taken from them by Charles
Martel.&nbsp; It was to this castle that Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
sketching duty was to be paid, and Maria and Bertha expressed
their determination of climbing up to it, in hopes, as the latter
said, of finding Charles Martel&rsquo;s original hammer.&nbsp;
Lieschen, puffing and panting already, looked horrified, and
laughingly they bade her sit down and knit, whilst they set out
on their adventure.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be smiled as she looked up,
and uttered a prognostic that made Bertha the more defiant,
exhilarated as she was by the delicious compound of sea and
mountain breeze, and by the exquisite view, the roofs of the town
sloping rapidly down, and the hills stretching round, clothed in
pine woods, into which the gray olivettes came stealing up, while
beyond lay the sea, intensely blue, and bearing on its bosom the
three Isles d&rsquo;Or flushed with radiant colour.</p>
<p>The sisters bravely set themselves to scramble among the
rocks, each surface turned to the sea-breeze exquisitely and
fantastically tinted by coloured lichens, and all interspersed
with the classical acanthus&rsquo; noble leaves, the juniper, and
the wormwood.&nbsp; On they went, winding upwards as Bertha
hoped, but also sideways, and their circuit had lasted a weary
while, and made them exhausted and breathless, when looking round
for their bearings, they found themselves in an enchanted maze of
gray rocks, half hidden in myrtle, beset by the bristly
battledores of prickly pear, <!-- page 443--><a
name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 443</span>and shaded
by cork trees.&nbsp; Above was the castle, perched up, and
apparently as high above them as when they began their
enterprise; below was a steep descent, clothed with pines and
adorned with white heaths.&nbsp; The place was altogether
strange; they had lost themselves; Bertha began to repent of her
adventure, and Maria was much disposed to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Maria,&rsquo; said Bertha, &lsquo;we will
not try to go any higher.&nbsp; See, here is the dry bed of a
torrent that will make a famous path down.&nbsp; There,
that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; What a picture it is! what an exquisite
peep of the sea between the boughs!&nbsp; What now, what
frightens you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old woman, she looks so horrid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The witch for the lost children?&nbsp; No, no, Maria,
she is only gathering fir cones, and completing the picture in
her red <i>basquine</i>, brown jacket, and great hat.&nbsp; I
would ask her the way, but that we could not understand her
Proven&ccedil;al.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear! I wish Ph&oelig;be was here! I wish we were
safe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I ever come mountain-climbing again with you at my
heels!&nbsp; Take care, there&rsquo;s no danger if you mind your
feet, and we must come out somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The somewhere, when the slope became less violent, was among
vineyards and olivettes, no vestige of a path through them, only
a very small cottage, picturesquely planted among the rocks,
whence proceeded the sounds of a
<i>cornet-&agrave;-piston</i>.&nbsp; As Bertha stood considering
which way to take, a dog flew out of the house and began
barking.&nbsp; This brought out a man, who rudely shouted to the
terrified pair that they were trespassing.&nbsp; They would have
fled at once up the torrent-bed, bad as it was for ascent, but
there was a derisive exclamation and laugh, and half-a-dozen men,
half-tipsy, came pouring out of the cottage, bawling to Colibri,
the rough, shaggy white dog, that seemed disposed to spring at
the Maltese in Bertha&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>The foremost, shouting in French for the sisters to stop,
pointed to what he called the way, and Bertha drew Maria in that
direction, trusting that they should escape by submission, but
after going a little distance, she found herself at the edge of a
bare, deep, dry ravine, steep on each side, almost so as to be
impassable.&nbsp; The path only ran on the other side.&nbsp;
There was another shout of exultation and laughter at the English
girls&rsquo; consternation.&nbsp; At this evident trick of the
surly peasants, Maria shook all over, and burst into tears, and
Bertha, gathering courage, turned to expostulate and offer a
reward, but her horrible stammer coming on worse than ever,
produced nothing but inarticulate sounds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monsieur, there is surely some mistake,&rsquo; said a
clear voice in good French from the path on the other side, and
looking across, the sisters were cheered by an unmistakable
English brown hat.&nbsp; The peasants drew back a little,
believing that the young ladies were not so unprotected as they
had supposed, and the first speaker, with something like apology,
declared that this was <!-- page 444--><a
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>really the
path, and descending where the sides were least steep, held out
his hand to help Bertha.&nbsp; The lady, whose bank was more
practicable, came down to meet them, saying in French, with much
emphasis, that she would summon &lsquo;those gentlemen&rsquo; to
their assistance if desired; words that had considerable effect
upon the enemy.</p>
<p>Poor Maria was in such terror that she could hardly keep her
footing, and the hands both of Bertha and the unknown friend were
needed to keep her from affording still more diversion to the
peasants by falling prostrate.&nbsp; The lady seemed intuitively
to understand what was best for both, and between them they
contrived to hush her sobs, and repress her inclination to scream
for Ph&oelig;be, and thus to lead her on, each holding a hand
till they were at a safe distance; and Bertha, whose terror had
been far greater than at the robbery at home, felt that she could
let herself speak, when she quivered out an agony of trembling
thanks.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad you are safe from these vile
men,&rsquo; said the lady, kindly, &lsquo;though they could
hardly have done anything really to hurt you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frenchmen should not laugh at English girls,&rsquo;
cried Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I wish my brothers were
here,&rsquo; and she turned round with a fierce gesture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, Ph&oelig;be; I want Ph&oelig;be and
Lieschen!&rsquo; was Maria&rsquo;s cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I help you find your party?&rsquo; was the next
question; and the voice had a gentle, winning tone that reassured
Maria, who clung tight to her hand, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go away;&rsquo; and though for months past the
bare proposal of encountering a stranger would have made Bertha
almost speechless, she felt a soothing influence that enabled her
to reply with scarcely a hesitation.&nbsp; On comparing notes, it
was discovered that the girls had wandered so far away from their
sister that they could only rejoin her by re-entering the town
and mounting again; and their new friend, seeing how nervous and
agitated both still were, offered to escort them, only giving
notice to her own party what had become of her.</p>
<p>She had come up with some sketching acquaintance, and not
drawing herself, had, like the sisters, been exploring among the
rocks, when she had suddenly come on them in the distress which
had so much shaken them, that, reluctant to lose sight of their
guardian, they accompanied her till she saw one of her friends,
and then waited while she ran down with the announcement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How ridiculous it is in me,&rsquo; muttered Bertha to
herself, discontentedly; &lsquo;she will think us wild
creatures.&nbsp; I wish we were not both so tall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And embarrassment, together with the desire to explain,
deprived her so entirely of utterance, that Maria volunteered,
&lsquo;Bertha always speaks so funnily since she was
ill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rather a perplexing speech for the lady to
hear; but instead of replying, she asked which was their hotel;
and Bertha answering, she turned with a start of surprise and
interest, as if to see their <!-- page 445--><a
name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 445</span>faces
better, adding, &lsquo;I have not seen you at the <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>;&rsquo; and under the strange influence of
her voice and face, Bertha was able to answer, &lsquo;No.&nbsp;
As Maria says, I have been very silly since my illness in the
winter, and&mdash;and they have given way to me, and let me see
no one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we shall see <i>you</i>; you are in our
hotel,&rsquo; cried Maria.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do come and let me show
you all my Swiss costumes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you; if&mdash;&rsquo; and she paused, perhaps a
little perplexed by Maria; and Bertha added, in the most womanly
voice that she could muster, &lsquo;My sister and Miss Charlecote
will be very glad to see you&mdash;very much obliged to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Maria, who was unusually demonstrative, put another
question&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you ill?&nbsp; Bertha says everybody here is
ill.&nbsp; I hope you are not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
here with my uncle and aunt.&nbsp; It is my uncle who has been
unwell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha, afraid that Maria might blunder into a history of her
malady, began to talk fast of the landscape and its
beauties.&nbsp; The stranger seemed to understand her desire to
lead away from herself, and readily responded, with a manner that
gave sweetness to all she said.&nbsp; She was not very
young-looking, and Maria&rsquo;s notion might be justified that
she was at Hy&egrave;res on her own account, for there was hardly
a tint of colour on her cheek; she was exceedingly spare and
slender, and there was a wasted, worn look about the lower part
of her face, and something subdued in her expression, as if some
great, lasting sorrow had passed over her.&nbsp; Her eyes were
large, brown, soft, and full of the same tender, pensive kindness
as her voice and smile; and perhaps it was this air of patient
suffering that above all attracted Bertha, in the soreness of her
wounded spirit, just as the affectionateness gained Maria, with
the instinct of a child.</p>
<p>However it might be, Ph&oelig;be, who had become uneasy at
their absence, and only did not go to seek them from the
conviction that nothing would set them so completely astray as
not finding her at her post, was exceedingly amazed to be hailed
by them from beneath instead of above, and to see them so
amicably accompanied by a stranger.&nbsp; Maria went on in
advance to greet the newly-recovered sister, and tell their
adventure; and Bertha, as she saw Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s pretty,
grateful, self-possessed greeting, rejoiced that their friend
should see that one of the three, at least, knew what to say, and
could say it.&nbsp; As they all crept down together through the
rugged streets, Ph&oelig;be felt the same strange attraction as
her sisters, accompanied by a puzzling idea that she had seen the
young lady before, or some one very like her.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be
was famous for seeing likenesses; and never forgetting a face she
had once seen, her recognitions were rather a proverb in the
family; and she felt her credit almost at stake in making out the
countenance before her; but it was all in vain, and she was
obliged to resign herself to discuss the <!-- page 446--><a
name="page446"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 446</span>Pyrenees,
where it appeared that their new friend had been spending the
summer.</p>
<p>At the inn-door they parted, she going along a corridor to her
aunt&rsquo;s rooms, and the three Fulmorts hurrying
simultaneously to Miss Charlecote to narrate their
adventure.&nbsp; She was as eager as they to know the name of
their rescuer, and to go to thank her; and ringing for the
courier, sent him to make inquiries.&nbsp; &lsquo;Major and Mrs.
Holmby, and their niece,&rsquo; was the result; and the next
measure was Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s setting forth to call on them
in their apartments, and all the three young ladies wishing to
accompany her&mdash;even Bertha!&nbsp; What could this encounter
have done to her?&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be withdrew her claim at once,
and persuaded Maria to remain, with the promise that her new
friend should be invited to enjoy the exhibition of the book of
Swiss costumes; and very soon she was admiring them, after having
received an explanation sufficient to show her how to deal with
Maria&rsquo;s peculiarities.&nbsp; Mrs. Holmby, a commonplace,
good-natured woman, evidently knew who all the other party were,
and readily made acquaintance with Miss Charlecote, who had, on
her side, the same strange impression of knowing the name as
Ph&oelig;be had of knowing the face.</p>
<p>Bertha, who slept in the same room with Ph&oelig;be, awoke her
in the morning with the question, &lsquo;What do you think is
Miss Holmby&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not hear it mentioned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but you ought to guess.&nbsp; Do you not see how
names impress their own individuality?&nbsp; You need not laugh;
I know they do.&nbsp; Could you possibly have been called
Augusta, and did not Katherine quite pervade Miss
Fennimore?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, according to your theory, what is her
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is either Eleanor or Cecily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;what put that
into your head?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her expression&mdash;no, her entire <i>Wesen</i>.&nbsp;
Something homely, simple, a little old-fashioned, and yet
refined.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is odd,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, pausing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is odd?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have explained the likeness I could not make
out.&nbsp; I once saw a photograph of a Cecily, with exactly the
character you mention.&nbsp; It was that of which she reminded
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cecily?&nbsp; Who could it have been?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the Raymond cousinhood.&nbsp; What o&rsquo;clock
is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get up yet, Ph&oelig;be; I want to tell
you Miss Holmby&rsquo;s history, as I make it out.&nbsp; She said
she was not ill, but I am convinced that her uncle and aunt took
her abroad to give her change, not after illness, but
sorrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am sure she has known trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Bertha, stifling her voice, so that
her sister could hardly hear, &lsquo;that sorrow could have been
only of one kind.&nbsp; Patient waiting is stamped on her
brow.&nbsp; She is trying to lift up her head after cruel
disappointment.&nbsp; Oh, I hope he is dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 447--><a name="page447"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
447</span>And, to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s surprise and alarm, the
poor little fortune-teller burst into tears, and sobbed
violently.&nbsp; There could be no doubt that her own
disappointment, rather than that which she ascribed to a
stranger, prompted this gush of feeling; but it was strange, for
in all the past months the poor child&rsquo;s sorrow and shame
had been coldly, hardly, silently borne.&nbsp; The new scenes had
thrust it into abeyance, and spirits and strength had forced
trouble aside, but this was the only allusion to it since her
conversation with Miss Charlecote on her sick bed, and the first
sign of softening.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be durst not enter into the
subject, but soothed and composed her by caresses and
cheerfulness; but either the tears, or perhaps their original
cause&mdash;the fatigue and terror of the previous day&mdash;had
entirely unhinged her, and she was in such a nervous, trembling
state, and had so severe a headache, that she was left lying
down, under Lieschen&rsquo;s charge, when the others went to the
English chapel.&nbsp; Her urgent entreaty was that they would
bring Miss Holmby to her on their return.&nbsp; She had conceived
almost a passion for this young lady.&nbsp; Secluded as she had
been, no intercourse beyond her own family had made known to her
the pleasure of a friendship; and her mind, in its revival from
its long exhaustion, was full of ardour, in the enthusiasm of a
girl&rsquo;s adoration of a full-grown woman.&nbsp; The new and
softening sensation was infinite gain, even by merely lessening
her horror of society; and when the three churchgoers joined the
Holmby party on their way back from the chapel, they begged, as a
kindness to an invalid, for a visit to Bertha.</p>
<p>It was granted most readily, as if equally pleasant to the
giver of the kindness and to the receiver, and the two young
maidens walked home together.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be could not but
explain their gratitude to any one who could rouse Bertha, saying
that her spirits had received a great shock, and that the effects
of her illness on her speech and her eyes had made her painfully
bashful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad,&rsquo; was the hurried, rather quivering
answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad if I can be of any use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was surprised, while gratified, by the eager
tenderness of her meeting with Bertha, who, quite revived, was in
the sitting-room to greet her, and seemed to expand like a plant
in the sunshine, under the influence of those sweet brown
eyes.&nbsp; Her liveliness and drollery awoke, and her sister was
proud that her new friend should see her cleverness and
intelligence; but all the time the likeness to that photograph
continued to haunt Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s mind, as she continued to
discover more resemblances, and to decide that if such were
impressed by the Christian name, Bertha was a little witch to
detect it.</p>
<p>Afternoon came, and as usual they all walked seawards.&nbsp;
As Bertha said, they had had enough of the heights, and tried
going towards the sea, as their new friend wished, although
warned by the Fulmorts that it was a long walk, the
<i>&eacute;tangs</i>, or great <!-- page 448--><a
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>salt-pools,
spoiling the coast as a beach.&nbsp; But all were brave walkers,
and exercise always did Bertha good.&nbsp; They had lovely views
of the town as they wound about the hills, and admired its old
streets creeping up the hill, and the two long wings stretching
on either side.&nbsp; An iron cross stood up before the old
church, relieved by the exquisite radiance of the sunset
sky.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Honor, &lsquo;I always choose
to believe that is the cross to which the legend
belongs.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell it, please, Miss
Charlecote,&rsquo; cried Maria.</p>
<p>And Honor told a veritable legend of Hy&egrave;res:&mdash;A
Moorish princess, who had been secretly baptized and educated as
a Christian by her nurse, a Christian slave, was beloved by a
genie.&nbsp; She regarded him with horror, pined away, and grew
thin and pale.&nbsp; Her father thought to raise her spirits by
marrying her, and bestowed her on the son of a neighbouring king,
sending her off in full procession to his dominions.&nbsp; On the
way, however, lay a desert, where the genie had power to raise a
sand-storm, with which he overwhelmed the suite, and flew away
with the princess.&nbsp; But he could not approach her; she kept
him at bay with the sign of the cross, until, enraged, he drove
her about on a whirlwind for three days, and finally dashed her
dead upon this coast.&nbsp; There she lay, fair as an almond
blossom, and royally robed, and the people of Hy&egrave;res took
her up and gave her honourable burial.&nbsp; When the king her
father heard of it, he offered to reward them with a cross of
gold of the same weight as his daughter; but, said the townsmen,
&lsquo;Oh, king, if we have a cross of gold, the Moors will come
and slay us for its sake, therefore give us the gold in coin, and
let the cross be of iron.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there it stands,&rsquo; said the guest, looking
up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it does,&rsquo; said Honor, confronting, as
usual, the common-sense led pupils of Miss Fennimore, with her
willing demi-credulity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a beautiful story!&rsquo; was the comment;
&lsquo;and, like other traditions, full of unconscious
meaning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A speech this, as if it had been made to delight Honor, whose
eyes were met by a congratulatory glance from Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
At the farther words, &lsquo;It is very striking&mdash;the evil
spirit&rsquo;s power ending with the slaying the body, never
harming the soul, nor bending the will&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bending the will is harming the soul,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; was her companion&rsquo;s answer,
&lsquo;the fatal evil is, when both wills are bent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was too single-minded, too single-willed, at once
to understand this, till Miss Charlecote whispered a reference to
St. Paul&rsquo;s words of deep experience, &lsquo;To will is
present with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;she might even have
preferred the genie, but as long as her principle and better will
resisted, she was safe from herself as well as from
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Liked the nasty genie?&rsquo; said Maria, who had
listened only as <!-- page 449--><a name="page449"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 449</span>to a fairy tale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
Ph&oelig;be, genies come out of bottles, and go away in smoke,
Lieschen told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Bertha, in a low voice of
feeling, piteous in one of her years, &lsquo;if so, it needed no
outward whirlwind to fling her dead on the coast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there she found peace,&rsquo; answered the guest,
with a suppressed, but still visible sign of weariness.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh! it was worth the whirlwind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was forced to attend to Maria, whose imagination
had been a good deal impressed, and who was anxious to make
another attempt on a pilgrimage to castle and cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Mervyn comes back, Maria, we may try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The guest, who was speaking, stopped short in the midst.&nbsp;
Had she been infected by Bertha&rsquo;s hesitation?&nbsp; She
began again, and seemed to have forgotten what she meant to have
said.&nbsp; However, she recovered herself; and there was nothing
remarkable through the rest of the walk, but, on coming indoors,
she managed to detain Ph&oelig;be behind the others, saying,
lightly, &lsquo;Miss Fulmort, you have not seen the view from my
window.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be followed to her little bed-room,
and gazed out at the lovely isles, bathed in light so as to be
almost transparent, and the ship of war in the bay, all shadowy
and phantom-like.&nbsp; She spoke her admiration warmly, but met
with but a half assent.&nbsp; The owner of the room was leaning
her head against the glass, and, with an effort for indifference
said, &lsquo;Did I hear that&mdash;that you were expecting your
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are Cecily!&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be, instead
of answering.</p>
<p>And Cecily, turning away from the window, leant against the
wall for support, and her pale face crimsoning, said, &lsquo;I
thought you did not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sisters do not,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but
he told me, when&mdash;when he hoped&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now you will help me?&rsquo; said Cecily, hurrying
out her words, as if overpowering one of her wills.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You will, I know!&nbsp; I have promised my father and
uncle to have nothing to do with him.&nbsp; Do not let me be
taken by surprise.&nbsp; Give me notice, that I may get Aunt
Holmby away before he comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! must it be so?&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is not like what he used to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have promised,&rsquo; repeated Cecily; and grasping
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s wrist, she added, &lsquo;you will help me to
keep my promise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, in her grave, reliable
voice, and Cecily drew a long breath.</p>
<p>There were five minutes of silence, while Ph&oelig;be stood
studying Cecily, and thinking how much injustice she had done to
her, how little she had expected a being so soft and feeling in
her firmness, and grieving the more at Mervyn&rsquo;s loss.&nbsp;
Cecily at last spoke, &lsquo;When will he come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot tell; most likely not for a week, perhaps not
for a fortnight.&nbsp; It depends on how he likes
Corsica.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 450--><a name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
450</span>&lsquo;I think my aunt will be willing to go,&rsquo;
said Cecily.&nbsp; &lsquo;My uncle has been talking of
Nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then must we lose you,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
&lsquo;when you are doing Bertha so much good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to be with you while I can, if I
may,&rsquo; said Cecily, her eyes full of tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you know us at first?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you were in this hotel; and after your sisters
had spoken, and I saw Bertha&rsquo;s face, I was sure who she
was.&nbsp; I thought no one was with you but Miss Charlecote, and
that no one knew, so that I might safely indulge
myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word was out before she could recall it,
and trying, as it were, to hide it, she said, &lsquo;But how, if
you knew what had passed, did you not sooner know it was
I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because we thought your name was Holmby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you, indeed.&nbsp; You did not know that my aunt
Holmby is my mother&rsquo;s sister?&nbsp; She kindly took me when
my uncle was ordered to spend this winter abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were ill and tried.&nbsp; Bertha read that in your
face.&nbsp; Oh! when you see how much
difference&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not see.&nbsp; Do not talk of it, or we must not
be together; and indeed it is very precious to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She rested her head on Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s shoulder, and put an
arm round her waist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only one thing I must
ask,&rsquo; she said, presently; &lsquo;is he well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite well,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
has been getting better ever since we left home.&nbsp; Then you
did not know he was with us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; It is not right for me to dwell on those
things, and they never mention any of you to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will write to us now?&nbsp; You will not desert
Bertha?&nbsp; You do not know how much you are doing for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear child!&nbsp; She is so like what he was when first
he came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you could guess what she has suffered, and how fond
he is of her, you would not turn away from her.&nbsp; You will
let her be your friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be right,&rsquo; said Cecily, with tearful eyes,
but her mouth set into a steadfast expression, as resolute as
sweetly sad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know better what is right than I do,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;I who feel for him and Bertha.&nbsp; But if
you have not heard from him for so long, I think there are things
you ought to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At home, at home,&rsquo; said Cecily; &lsquo;there it
may be right to listen.&nbsp; Here I am trusted alone, and I have
only to keep my promise.&nbsp; Tell me when I am at home, and it
will make me happy.&nbsp; Though, nonsense! my wizened old face
is enough to cure him,&rsquo; and she tried to laugh.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be regretted what she had said of Bertha&rsquo;s
impression, and believed that the gentle, worn face ought to be
far more touching than the most radiant charms, but when she
strove to say that it was not beauty that Mervyn loved, she was
hushed at once, and by the same mild authority turned out of the
room.</p>
<p>Well for her that she could tell her story to Miss Charlecote
<!-- page 451--><a name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
451</span>without breach of confidence!&nbsp; Honor&rsquo;s first
impulse was displeasure with the aunt, who she was sure had let
her speak <i>of</i>, though not <i>to</i>, Miss Holmby without
correcting her, and must purposely have kept the whole Raymond
connection out of sight.&nbsp; &lsquo;Depend upon it,
Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;she will keep her niece
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Cecily, what will she do?&nbsp; I wish they would
go, for I feel sure that she will think it her duty to hold out
against him, till she has her father&rsquo;s sanction; she will
seem hard, and he&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not reckon too much on him, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Yes,
it is a hard saying, but men care so much for youth and beauty,
that he may find her less attractive.&nbsp; He may not understand
how superior she must have become to what she was when he first
knew her.&nbsp; Take care how you plead his cause without being
sure of his sentiments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact, Honor thought Cecily Raymond so infinitely above
Mervyn Fulmort, at his very best, that she could not regard the
affair as hopeful under any aspect; and the parties concerned
being just at the time of life when a woman becomes much the
elder of a man of the same years, she fully expected that
Cecily&rsquo;s loss of bloom would entirely take away his desire
to pursue his courtship.</p>
<p>The next event was a diplomatic call from Mrs. Holmby, to
sound Miss Charlecote, whose name she knew as a friend both of
the Fulmorts and Moorcroft Raymonds, and who, she had feared,
would use her influence against so unequal a match for the
wealthy young squire.&nbsp; When convinced of her admiration of
Cecily, the good aunt proceeded to condemn the Raymond
pride.&nbsp; They called it religion, but she was not so taken
in.&nbsp; What reasonable person heeded what a young man might
have done when he was sowing his wild oats?&nbsp; No, it was only
that the Baronet blood disdained the distillery, whereas the
Fulmorts represented that good old family, the Mervyns, and it
was a very fine estate, was not it?&nbsp; She had no patience
with such nonsense, not she!&nbsp; All Sir John&rsquo;s doing;
for, between themselves, poor dear George Raymond had no spirit
at all, and was quite under his brother&rsquo;s thumb.&nbsp; Such
a family, and such a thing as it would be for them to have that
girl so well married.&nbsp; <i>She</i> would not take her
away.&nbsp; The place agreed with the Major, and she had told
Cecily she could not think of leaving it.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be saw how close a guard Cecily must have learnt to
keep on herself, for not a tone nor look betrayed that she was
suffering unusual emotion.&nbsp; She occupied herself quietly,
and was most tenderly kind to Bertha and Maria, exerting herself
to converse with Bertha, and to enter into her pursuits as
cheerfully as if her mind was disengaged.&nbsp; Sometimes
Ph&oelig;be fancied that the exceeding gentleness of her voice
indicated when she was most tried, but she attempted no more
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>, and Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s conjecture that in the recesses of her <!--
page 452--><a name="page452"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
452</span>heart she was rejoiced to be detained by no fault of
her own, remained unverified.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be resigned Cecily
for the present to Bertha&rsquo;s exclusive friendship.&nbsp;
Competition would have been unwise, even if the forbidden subject
had not been a restraint where the secret was known, while to
soothe and cherish Bertha and settle her mind to begin life again
was a welcome and fitting mission for Cecily, and inclination as
well as discretion therefore held Ph&oelig;be aloof, preventing
Maria from interfering, and trusting that Cecily was becoming
Bertha&rsquo;s Mr. Charlecote.</p>
<p>Mervyn came back sooner than she had expected him, having soon
tired of Corsica.&nbsp; His year of ill-health and of her
attendance had made him dependent on her; he did not enter into
novelty or beauty without Bertha; and his old restless demon of
discontent made him impatient to return to his ladies.&nbsp; So
he took Ph&oelig;be by surprise, walking in as she was finishing
a letter to Augusta before joining the others in the
olivettes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ph&oelig;be, how&rsquo;s Bertha?&nbsp; Ready to
leave this hot-vapour-bath of a hole?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will say to it now,&rsquo;
she answered looking down, and a little tremulous.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who do you think is here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Hastings?&nbsp; If he dares to show his nose here,
I&rsquo;ll get him hissed out of the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, something very different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, make haste,&rsquo; he said, in the grim voice of
a tired man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is here&mdash;Cecily Raymond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of that?&rsquo;&nbsp; He sat down, folded his
arms, and crossed his ankles, the picture of dogged
indifference.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does it matter to me who comes or goes?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t stop to rehearse arrivals, but ring for something to
eat.&nbsp; An atrocious <i>mistral</i>!&nbsp; My throat is like a
turnpike road?&nbsp; Call it January?&nbsp; It is a
mockery!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be obeyed him; but she was in a ferment of wrath and
consternation, and clear of nothing save that Cecily must be
prepared for his appearance.&nbsp; She was leaving the room when
he called her to ask what she was doing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to tell the others that you are
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the olive yards behind the hotel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry, and I&rsquo;ll
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, but I had better go on before.&nbsp; Miss
Raymond is with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It makes no odds to her.&nbsp; Stop a minute, I tell
you.&nbsp; What is the matter with her?&rsquo;&nbsp; (Said with
some uneasiness, hidden by gruffness.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not here for her own health, but Major Holmby is
rheumatic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that intolerable woman is here, is she?&nbsp; Then
you may <!-- page 453--><a name="page453"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 453</span>give Miss Charlecote notice to pack
up her traps, and we&rsquo;ll set off to-morrow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>If a desire to box a man&rsquo;s ears ever tingled in
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s fingers, it was at that moment.&nbsp; Not
trusting herself to utter a word, she went up-stairs, put on her
hat, and walked forth, feeling as if the earth had suddenly
turned topsy-turvy with her, and as if she could look no one in
the face.&nbsp; Set off to-morrow!&nbsp; He might tell Miss
Charlecote himself, she would not!&nbsp; Yet, after all, he had
been rejected.&nbsp; His departure might not torture Cecily like
the sight of his indifference.&nbsp; But what despair for Bertha,
thought Ph&oelig;be, as she saw the friends pacing the paths
between the rows of olives, while Miss Charlecote and Maria were
gathering magnificent blue violets.&nbsp; At the first hint, Miss
Charlecote called to Bertha, who came reluctantly, while
Ph&oelig;be, with almost sickening pity, murmured her tidings to
Cecily&mdash;adding, &lsquo;I do not think he is coming
out.&nbsp; He is having something to eat,&rsquo; in hopes that
this tardiness might be a preparation.&nbsp; She was relieved
that Bertha rushed back again to monopolize Miss Raymond, and
overwhelm her with schemes for walks under Mervyn&rsquo;s
escort.&nbsp; Cecily let her talk, but made no promises, and the
soft gentleness of those replies thrilled as pangs of pain on
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s pitying heart.</p>
<p>As they walked homewards, Mervyn himself appeared, slowly
sauntering towards them.&nbsp; The younger sisters sprang to meet
him, Cecily fell back to Miss Charlecote.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be held
her breath, and scarcely durst look.&nbsp; There was a touch of
the hand, a greeting, then Bertha pounced on her brother to tell
the adventure of the ravine; and Cecily began to set Maria off
about the flowers in her nosegay.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be could only
come close to Miss Charlecote and squeeze her hand
vehemently.</p>
<p>The inn-door was reached, and Mervyn waiting till Cecily came
up, said with grave formality, &lsquo;I hear my sisters are
indebted to you for your assistance in a very unpleasant
predicament.</p>
<p>She bowed, and he bowed.&nbsp; That was all, and they were in
their several apartments.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be had never felt in
such a fever.&nbsp; She could discern character, but love was but
an external experience to her, and she could not read the riddle
of Mervyn&rsquo;s repudiation of intercourse with their
fellow-inmates, and his restlessness through the evening,
checking Bertha for boring about her friend, and then encouraging
her to go on with what she had been saying.&nbsp; At last,
however, Bertha voluntarily ceased her communications and could
be drawn out no farther; and when the candle was put out at
night, she electrified Ph&oelig;be with the remark, &lsquo;It is
Mervyn, and you know it; so you may as well tell me all about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had no choice but compliance; advising Bertha not
to betray her knowledge, and anxious to know the conclusions
which this acute young woman would draw from the present
conjuncture.&nbsp; But Bertha was too fond of both parties not to
<!-- page 454--><a name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
454</span>be full of unmitigated hope.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;with Cecily there, I shall
not mind going home, I shall not mind anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If only she will be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; The more Mervyn sulks, the
more it shows that he cares for her; and if she cares for him, of
course it will come right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember what she said about the two wills
contending?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if she ever <i>did</i> think Mervyn the genie,
she has crossed him once, twice, thrice, till she may turn him
from Urgan into Ethert Brand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks it her duty not to hear that she
has.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, oh! from you who know all about it; but
didn&rsquo;t I tell her plenty about Mervyn&rsquo;s kindness to
me?&nbsp; Yes, indeed I did.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help it, you
know.&nbsp; It did not seem true to let anybody begin to be my
friend unless she knew&mdash;<i>all that</i>.&nbsp; So I told
her&mdash;and oh! Ph&oelig;be, she was so dear and nice, better
than ever after that,&rsquo; continued Bertha, with what sounded
like sobs; &lsquo;and then you know she could not help hearing
how good and patient he was with me&mdash;only growing kinder and
kinder the more tiresome I was.&nbsp; She must feel that,
Ph&oelig;be, must not she?&nbsp; And then she asked about Robert,
and I told her how Mervyn has let him get a chaplain to look
after the distillery people, and the Institute that that old
gin-palace is to be made into.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those were just the things I was longing to tell
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She could not stop <i>me</i>, you know, because I knew
nothing,&rsquo; cried Bertha, triumphantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are not
you satisfied, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought to be, if I were sure of his feelings.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t plunge about so, Bertha,&mdash;and I am not sure
either that she will believe him yet to be a religious
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; I was just
going to begin to like religion, and think it the only true key
to metaphysics and explanation of existence, but if it sticks
between those two, I shall only see it as a weak, rigid
superstition, parting those who were meant for one
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was strongly tempted to answer, but the little
travelling clock struck, and thus acted as a warning that to let
Bertha pursue an exciting discussion at this time of night would
be ruinous to her nerves the next day.&nbsp; So with a
good-night, the elder sister closed her ears, and lay pondering
on the newly disclosed stage in Bertha&rsquo;s mind, which
touched her almost as closely as the fate of her brother&rsquo;s
attachment.</p>
<p>The ensuing were days of suppressed excitement, chiefly
manifested by the yawning fits that seized on Bertha whenever no
scene in the drama was passing before her.&nbsp; In fact, the
scenes presented little.&nbsp; Cecily was not allowed to shut
herself up, and did nothing remarkable, though avoiding the walks
that she would otherwise have taken with the Fulmort party; and
when she found that Bertha was aware of her position, firmly
making silence on that head the condition of their <!-- page
455--><a name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
455</span>interviews.&nbsp; Mervyn let her alone, and might have
seemed absolutely indifferent, but for the cessation of all
complaints of Hy&egrave;res, and for the noteworthy brightness,
obligingness, and good humour of his manners.&nbsp; Even in her
absence, though often restless and strangely watchful, he was
always placable and good-tempered, never even scolding
Ph&oelig;be; and in her presence, though he might not exchange
three words, or offer the smallest service, there was a repose
and content on his countenance that gave his whole expression a
new reading.&nbsp; He was looking particularly well, fined down
into alertness by his disciplined life and hill climbing, his
complexion cleared and tanned by mountain air, and the habits and
society of the last year leaving an unconscious impress unlike
that which he used to bring from his former haunts.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be wondered if Cecily remarked it.&nbsp; She was not
aware that Cecily did not know him without that restful look.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be came to the conclusion that Cecily was persuaded
of the cessation of his attachment, and was endeavouring to be
thankful, and to accustom herself to it.&nbsp; After the first,
she did not hide herself to any marked degree; and, probably to
silence her aunt, allowed that lady to take her on one of the
grand Monday expeditions, when all the tolerably sound visiting
population of Hy&egrave;res were wont to meet, to the number of
thirty or forty, and explore the scenery.&nbsp; Exquisite as were
the views, these were not romantic excursions, the numbers
conducing to gossip and chatter, but there were some who enjoyed
them the more in consequence; and Mervyn, who had been loudest in
vituperation of his first, found the present perfectly
delightful, although the chief of his time was spent in
preventing Mrs. Holmby&rsquo;s cross-grained donkey from lying
down to roll, and administering to the lady the chocolate drops
that he carried for Bertha&rsquo;s sustenance; Cecily, meantime,
being far before with his sisters, where Mrs. Holmby would gladly
have sent him if bodily terror would have permitted her to
dismiss her cavalier.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote and Ph&oelig;be, being among the best and
briskest of the female walkers, were the first to enter the town,
and there, in the <i>Place des Palmiers</i>, looking about him as
if he were greatly amazed at himself, they beheld no other than
the well-known figure of Sir John Raymond, standing beside the
Major, who was sunning himself under the palm-trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote, how are you?&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye do,
Miss Fulmort?&nbsp; Is your sister quite well again?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my little niece?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a little way behind with Bertha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we never thought to meet in such a place, did
we?&nbsp; What a country of stones I have come over to-day,
enough to break the heart of a farmer; and the very sheep are no
better than goats!&nbsp; Vineyards?&nbsp; What they call
vineyards are old black stumps that ought to be grubbed up for
firewood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I was struck by the wonderful cultivation of every
<!-- page 456--><a name="page456"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
456</span>available inch of ground.&nbsp; It speaks well for the
Proven&ccedil;als, if we judge by the proverb, &ldquo;<i>Autant
vaut l&rsquo;homme que vaut sa terre</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! there she comes;&rsquo; and he hastened to join
Cecily, while the deserted Bertha, coming up to her sister,
muttered, &lsquo;Wretched girl!&nbsp; I hear she had written to
him to fetch her home.&nbsp; That was what made her stay so
quietly, was it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No one could accuse Mervyn of indifference who saw the blank
look that overspread his face on hearing of Sir John&rsquo;s
arrival, but he said not a word, only hurried away to dress for
the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&nbsp; The first notice the
anxious ladies had that the tedious dinner was broken up, was a
knock at their door, and Cecily&rsquo;s entrance, looking
exceedingly white, and speaking very low.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am come
to wish you good-bye,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Uncle John
has been so kind as to come for me, and I believe we shall set
out to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maria alone could dare to shriek out, &lsquo;Oh! but you
promised to show me how to make a crown of my pink heaths, and I
have been out with Lieschen, and gathered such
beauties!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will come with me to my room I will show you
while I pack up,&rsquo; said Cecily, reducing Bertha to despair
by this most effectual barrier to confidence; but she entreated
leave to follow, since seeing Cecily playing with Maria was
better than not seeing her at all.</p>
<p>After some time, Mervyn came in, flushed and breathless, and
Honor kindly made an excuse for leaving him alone with
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; After diligently tossing a book from one hand
to the other for some minutes, he observed, <i>sotto voce</i>,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a more decent old fellow than I gave him
credit for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who, Sir John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And that was the whole result of the
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; He was in no mood
for questions, and marched out of the room for a moonlight
cigar.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be only remained with the conviction that
something had happened.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote was more fortunate.&nbsp; She had met the
Baronet in the passage, and was accosted by him with, &lsquo;Do
you ever do such a thing as take a turn on that
terrace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a welcome invitation, and in no more time than it took
to fetch a shawl, the two old friends were pacing the paved
terrace together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do you think of him?&rsquo; began Sir
John.&nbsp; &lsquo;There must be more good in him than I
thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much more than I thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has been speaking to me, and I can&rsquo;t say but
that I was sorry for him, though why it should have gone so hard
with so sensible and good a girl as Cecily to give up such a
scamp, I never could guess!&nbsp; I told George that seeing what
I saw of him, and knowing what I knew, I could think it nothing
better than a sacrifice to give her to him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly what I thought!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 457--><a name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
457</span>&lsquo;After the way he had used her, too&mdash;talking
nonsense to her, and then playing fast and loose, trying his luck
with half the young ladies in London, and then fancying she would
be thankful to him as soon as he wanted a wife to keep
house!&nbsp; Poor child, that would not have weighed with her a
moment though&mdash;it puts me out of patience to know how fond
she is of him&mdash;but for his scampishness, which made it a
clear duty to refuse him.&nbsp; Very well she behaved, poor
thing, but you see how she pined away&mdash;though her mother
tells me that not a fretful word was ever heard from her, as
active and patient and cheerful as ever.&nbsp; Then the Holmbys
took her abroad, the only thing to save her health, but I never
trusted the woman, and when by and by she writes to her father
that Fulmort was coming, and her aunt would not take her away,
&ldquo;George,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;never mind; I&rsquo;ll go at
once, and bring her home&mdash;she shall not be kept there to be
torn to pieces between her feelings and her duty.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And now I am come, I declare I don&rsquo;t know what to be
at&mdash;I should think nothing of it if the lad only talked of
reforming&mdash;but he looks so downcast, and owns so honestly
that we were quite right, and then that excellent little sister
of his is so fond of him, and you have stood his company this
whole year&mdash;that I declare I think he must be good for
something!&nbsp; Now you who have looked on all his life, just
say what you think of him&mdash;such a way as he went on in last
year, too&mdash;the crew that he got about him&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be thinks that was the consequence of his
disappointment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man that could bring such a lot into the same house
with that sister of his, had no business to think of
Cecily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has suffered for it, and pretty severely, and I do
think it has done him good.&nbsp; You must remember that he had
great disadvantages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which didn&rsquo;t hinder his brother from turning out
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert went to a public school&mdash;&rsquo; and there
she perceived she was saying something awkward, but Sir John half
laughed, and assented.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right, Miss Charlecote; private pupils are a
delusion?&nbsp; George never had one without a screw loose about
him.&nbsp; Parish priests were never meant for tutors&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ve told my boy, Charlie, that the one thing I&rsquo;ll
never consent to is his marrying on pupils&mdash;and doing two
good things by halves.&nbsp; It has well nigh worried his uncle
to death, and Cecily into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robert was younger, and the elders were all worse
managed.&nbsp; Besides, Mervyn&rsquo;s position, as it was
treated, made him discontented and uncomfortable; and this
attachment, which he was too&mdash;too&mdash;I can find no word
for it but contemptible&mdash;to avow, must have preyed on his
temper and spirits all the time he was trying to shake it
off.&nbsp; He was brought up to selfishness, and nothing but what
he underwent last year could have shaken him out of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you think he is shaken out of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 458--><a name="page458"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
458</span>&lsquo;Where Bertha is concerned I see that he
is&mdash;therefore I should hope it with his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, I suppose what must be must be.&nbsp; Not
that I have the least authority to say anything, but I could not
help telling the poor fellow thus much&mdash;that if he went on
steadily for a year or so, and continued in the same mind, I did
not see why he should not ask my brother and Cecily to reconsider
it.&nbsp; Then it will be for them to decide, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For them!&nbsp; As if Sir John were not in character as well
as name the guiding head of the family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;you will let me come
to your rooms this evening, for Mrs. Holmby is in such
displeasure with me, that I shall get nothing but black
looks.&nbsp; Besides, I want to see a little more of that nice
girl, his sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! Sir John, if ever you do consent, it will be more
than half for love of Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, for a girl like that to be so devoted to
him&mdash;her brother though he be&mdash;shows there must be more
in him than meets the eye.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just the girl that
I would not mind John&rsquo;s marrying.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>
<blockquote><p>Turn again, Whittington!&mdash;<i>Bow
Bells</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May had come round again before Robert Fulmort stood waiting
at the Waterloo Station to welcome the travellers, who had been
prohibited from putting Bertha&rsquo;s restored health to the
test of east winds.&nbsp; It was a vista of happy faces that he
encountered as he looked into the carriage window, yet the first
questions and answers were grave and mournful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Henderson still alive?&rsquo; asked Honora.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he sank rapidly, and died on Sunday week.&nbsp; I
was at the funeral on Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right; I am glad you went.&nbsp; I am sorry I was
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was deeply felt.&nbsp; Nearly all the clergy in the
archdeaconry, and the entire parish, were present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is taking care of the parish?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlecote Raymond has been coming over for the
Sundays, and giving great satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Robert, where&rsquo;s the Bannerman
carriage?&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be is to be victimized
there&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity,&rsquo; interposed Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is their brougham.&nbsp; I meant to drive to
Albury-street with her,&rsquo; said Robert, gazing at his brother
as if he scarcely knew him without the characteristic knitting of
the brow under a grievance, the scowl, or the half-sneering
smile; and with the cleared and lightened air that he had worn
ever since that little spark of hope had been left to burn and
shine undamped by dissipation or worldly policy.&nbsp; Bertha
also was changed.&nbsp; She had grown tall and womanly, her looks
beyond <!-- page 459--><a name="page459"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 459</span>her age, and if her childish
vivacity were gone, the softened gravity became her much
better.&nbsp; It was Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s report, however, for
which he chiefly longed, and he was soon seated beside her on the
way to Albury-street, while the others betook themselves
Citywards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, Ph&oelig;be, it is all right, and you are
satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Satisfied, grateful, thankful to the utmost,&rsquo;
said Ph&oelig;be, fervently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think I never was so
happy as all through the latter part of the journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think well of Bertha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot call her restored, for she is far more than
she was before.&nbsp; That meeting with Cecily Raymond did for
her what we could not do, and she is growing to be more than we
knew how to wish for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her spirits?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never high, and easily shaken.&nbsp; Her nerves are not
strong yet, and she will never, I fear, be quite girlishly
careless and merry, but she is grave and sweet.&nbsp; She does
not shrink from people now, and when I saw her among other girls
at Paris, she seemed older, much deeper, and altogether
superior.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does she think seriously?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks and reads, but it is not easy to guess what
she thinks, for she keeps silence, and has happily quite left off
arguing with Miss Charlecote.&nbsp; I believe Cecily has great
influence over her, and I think she will talk a great deal to
Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; Robin, do you think we could have dear Miss
Fennimore again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know what Mr. Parsons would say to you.&nbsp;
As you know, she told him that she wanted to do the most useful
work he could trust to her, so he has made her second mistress at
the day-school for his tradesmen&rsquo;s daughters; and what they
would do without her I cannot think!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must have very insufficient pay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but I think she is glad of that, and she had saved
a good deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I give you notice that I shall try hard to get her, if
Mr. Crabbe will only let us be as we were before.&nbsp; Do you
think there is any hope for us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell.&nbsp; I suspect that he will not consent
to your going home till Mervyn is married; and Augusta wants very
much to have you, for the season at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn and Miss Charlecote both say I ought to see a
little of the London world, and she promises to keep Maria and
Bertha till we see our way.&nbsp; I should not like them to be
without me anywhere else.&nbsp; You have not told me of poor
Bevil.&nbsp; You must have seen him often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he clings very much to me, poor fellow, and is
nearly as much cast down as at first.&nbsp; He has persuaded
himself that poor Juliana always continued what he thought her
when they met in their youth.&nbsp; Perhaps she had the germs of
it in her, <!-- page 460--><a name="page460"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 460</span>but I sometimes hardly know which
way to look when he is talking about her, and then I take shame
to myself for the hard judgments I cannot put away even
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Juliana!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, saddened by her
own sense that the difficulties of her present position were
lessened by the removal of this sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;And little
Elizabeth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a nice little thing, and her father hardly lets
her out of his sight.&nbsp; I have sometimes speculated whether
he might not ask you to keep house for him, but last time I saw
him, I fancied that he was inclined to hold aloof from
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather he did not ask us,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I am afraid Bertha would not look up to him if
she lived with him,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>Robert smiled, having himself become conscious of that
weakness in his good brother-in-law which Ph&oelig;be felt, but
did not name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Robert, suddenly
changing the subject, &lsquo;I have something for you to do; I
want you to call on Miss Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On her astonished look, he explained that he had made it his
business frequently to see Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s child, and of
late to give it some religious teaching.&nbsp; While thus
engaged, he had been surprised by the entrance of Lucilla,
looking wretchedly ill and exhausted, and though she had rallied
her spirits after the first moment, talked of having come up from
Essex for a day&rsquo;s holiday of shopping and seeing her
nephew, and had inquired eagerly and warmly for Miss Charlecote,
he had been sufficiently uneasy about her to go afterwards to
Mrs. Murrell, from whom he had learnt that she had avowed having
consulted a physician in the morning, and had procured her
address.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;I want you, with
whom she has never quarrelled, to call on her as an old friend
just come into her neighbourhood, and find out what was the
doctor&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; I am sure she is destroying
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole was said with perfect simplicity, without shrinking
from Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eye, as though he had absolutely
forgotten what sentiments he had once entertained; and
Ph&oelig;be could, neither in kindness nor humanity, refuse to be
the means of reopening communication with the voluntary
exile.&nbsp; She proposed to write and offer a call, but Robert,
fearing to rouse the old perverse pride, recommended that there
should be no preparation.&nbsp; Indeed, the chances of an
independent expedition seemed likely to be scanty, for Lady
Bannerman pounced on her sister as a truant bond-slave, who, when
captured, was to be useful all day, and go to parties all
night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have told all my friends that I was going to
introduce my sister, and what expectations you have,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;See, here are two cards for to-morrow night,
Lady Jane Hewett and Mrs. Gosling, the young widow that I want
Mervyn to meet, you <!-- page 461--><a name="page461"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 461</span>know.&nbsp; Clear &pound;5000 a
year, and such a charming house.&nbsp; Real first-rate suppers;
not like Lady Jane&rsquo;s bread-and-butter and cat-lap, as Sir
Nicholas says, just handed round.&nbsp; We would never go near
the place, but as I said to Sir Nicholas, any sacrifice for my
sister; and she has a son, you know, a fine young man; and if we
manage well, we shall be in time for Carrie Gosling&rsquo;s
supper.&nbsp; So mind that, Ph&oelig;be, and don&rsquo;t get
engaged to too many dances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there to be dancing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most likely.&nbsp; I hope you have something to
wear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I provided myself at Paris, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not mourning, I trust!&nbsp; That will never do!&nbsp;
Nobody thinks of mourning for a sister more than six months, and
it makes me so low to think of poor Juliana, and this horrid
complaint being in the family.&nbsp; It is quite a duty to keep
one&rsquo;s spirits up.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s Robert always so
lugubrious; and poor Sir Bevil looks as deplorable, and comes up
to town with that poor little girl all in crape, and won&rsquo;t
eat any luncheon!&nbsp; I declare it gave me such a turn that I
was obliged to have my little cordial before I could swallow a
mouthful!&nbsp; And now you come in black!&nbsp; It is quite
provoking!&nbsp; You must and shall get some colours
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, what I have is white and lilac.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On which neutral ground Ph&oelig;be took her stand, and the
French style and fashion so impressed Augusta&rsquo;s maid, that
she forced her ladyship to accept even simplicity as &lsquo;the
thing,&rsquo; and to sink back rebuked for the barbarism of
hinting at the enlivenment of pink ribbons or scarlet
flowers.</p>
<p>Though thus fortified against shopping on her own account,
liberty even to go to see her sisters was denied her, in
Augusta&rsquo;s infinite disgust at the locality, and
consideration for the horses.&nbsp; She was forced to be
contented with the report of Mervyn, who came to dinner and to go
to the evening parties, and who spoke of the girls as well and
happy; Maria &lsquo;in her native element&rsquo; at the infant
school, and both in a perfect rapture at receiving Miss
Fennimore, whom their hostess had asked to spend the evening in
Woolstone-lane.</p>
<p>Mervyn professed that he came entirely to see
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s debut in her Parisian costume, and amused
himself maliciously with endeavouring to delay the start from
Lady Jane&rsquo;s till too late for Mrs. Gosling&rsquo;s supper;
but Ph&oelig;be, who did not wish to enhance the sacrifice, would
not abet him, and positively, as he declared, aided Augusta in
her wild goose chase.</p>
<p>He contrived to have a good deal of conversation with
Ph&oelig;be in the course of the evening, and she heard from him
that old Crabbe was more crusty than ever, and would not hear of
his taking his sisters home, but, said he, that mattered the
less, considering that now they would be able to be at the
parsonage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The parsonage?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 462--><a name="page462"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
462</span>&lsquo;What! did you not know the living was in Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s gift?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that she has offered it to
Robert?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;at least she has told me of her
intentions.&nbsp; Highly proper in the old girl, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; They will settle it to-night, of course.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have the grounds laid out, and make quite a pretty
modern place of it.&nbsp; It has quite taken a weight off my mind
to know he is so well provided for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will make us all very happy; but I think he will be
sorry for St. Matthew&rsquo;s, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! parsons think nothing of changes.&nbsp; He can
appoint his own successor, and I&rsquo;ll not let things die
away.&nbsp; And now, Ph&oelig;be, is there anything you want to
do?&nbsp; I will not have Augusta tie you by the leg.&nbsp; I
will look out a lady&rsquo;s horse to-morrow, and come to ride
with you; or if you want to do anything, you can have the
brougham any day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you; there is one thing I want very much to
do,&rsquo; and she explained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Mervyn, &lsquo;a romantic
meeting.&nbsp; If I remember right, Mr. Robin used to be much
smitten with that little thing.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t reckon too much
on the parsonage, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are we to do if both brothers turn us out?&rsquo;
smiled Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of that.&nbsp; I should be glad enough
to get you in&mdash;and I am far enough from <i>the other
thing</i> yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Ph&oelig;be obtained the use of the brougham for the next
day and set off for her long Essex drive, much against
Augusta&rsquo;s will, and greatly wondering what it would
produce; compassionate of course for poor Lucilla, yet not
entirely able to wish that Robert should resign the charge for
which he was so eminently fitted, even for the sake of Hiltonbury
and home.&nbsp; Lucy must be altered, indeed, if he would not be
happier without her.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had written a few lines, saying that hearing that
Lucy was so near, she could not help begging to see her.&nbsp;
This she sent in with her card, and after a little delay, was
invited to come in.&nbsp; Lucilla met her at the top of the
stairs, and at first Ph&oelig;be only felt herself, clasped,
clung to, kissed, fondled with a sudden gasping, tearful
eagerness.&nbsp; Then as if striving to recall the ordinary tone,
Lucilla exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;There&mdash;I beg your pardon for
such an obstreperous greeting, but I am a famished creature here,
you see, and I did not expect such kindness.&nbsp; Luckily some
of my pupils are driving out with their mamma, and I have sent
the others to the nurse.&nbsp; Now then, take off your bonnet,
let me see you; I want to look at a home face, and you are as
fresh and as innocent as if not a year had passed over
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla fervently kissed her again, and then holding her hand,
gazed at her as if unwilling that either should break the happy
silence.&nbsp; Meantime Ph&oelig;be was shocked to see how
completely Robert&rsquo;s alarms were justified by Lucy&rsquo;s
appearance.&nbsp; The mere absence of the coquettish ringlets
made a considerable <!-- page 463--><a name="page463"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 463</span>difference, and the pale colour of
the hair, as it was plainly braided, increased the wanness of her
appearance.&nbsp; The transparent complexion had lost the lovely
carnation of the cheek, but the meandering veins of the temples
and eyelids were painfully apparent; and with the eyes so large
and clear as to be more like veronicas than ever, made the effect
almost ghastly, together with excessive fragility of the form,
and the shadowy thinness of the hand that held
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Bertha&rsquo;s fingers, at her
weakest, had been more substantial than these small things, which
had, however, as much character and force in their grasp as
ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, I am sure you are ill!&nbsp; How thin you
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, cod-liver oil is a base deception!&nbsp;
Never mind that&mdash;let me hear of Honor&mdash;are you with
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my sisters are, but I am with Augusta.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you do not come from her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; she does not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You excellent Ph&oelig;be; what have you done to keep
that bonny honest face all this time to refresh weary
eyes&mdash;being a little heroine, too.&nbsp; Well, but the
Honor&mdash;the old sweet Honey&mdash;is she her very
self?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I hope so; she has been so very kind to
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And found subjects in you not too cross-grained for her
kindness to be palatable!&nbsp; Ah! a good hard plunge into the
world teaches one what one left in the friendly ship!&nbsp; Not
that mine has been a hard one.&nbsp; I am not one of the pathetic
governesses of fiction.&nbsp; Every one has been kinder to me
than I am worth&mdash;But, oh! to hear myself called Lucy
again!&rsquo;&mdash;and she hid her face on Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
shoulder in another access of emotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You used not to like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Cilly days were over long ago.&nbsp; Only one person
ever used to call me Cilla;&rsquo; and she paused, and went on
afresh&mdash;&lsquo;So it was for Bertha&rsquo;s sake and
Mervyn&rsquo;s that Honor escorted you abroad.&nbsp; So much
Robert told me; but I don&rsquo;t understand it yet.&nbsp; It had
haunted me the whole winter that Robert was the only Mr. Fulmort
<i>she</i> could nurse; and if he told you I was upset, it was
that I did not quite know whether he were ghost or body when I
saw him there in the old place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he only told me you were looking very ill; and
indeed&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not ask him what concatenation made Honor take
Mervyn under her wing, like a hen hovering a vulture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a long story,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;but Bertha was very ill, and Mervyn much out of health;
and we were in great distress for an escort.&nbsp; I think it was
the kindest thing ever done, and the most successful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has it been a comfort to her?&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s
letters must be, I am sure.&nbsp; He will come home this autumn,
as soon as he has done laying out his railway, and then I shall
get him to beg <!-- page 464--><a name="page464"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 464</span>leave for me to make a little visit
to Hiltonbury before we go out to Canada.&nbsp; I could not go
out without a good word from her.&nbsp; She and Mr. Prendergast
are all that remains of the old life.&nbsp; I say, Ph&oelig;be,
did you hear of those cousins of mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was one of the reasons I wished to see you.&nbsp; I
thought you might like to hear of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charteris called on us at Nice.&nbsp;
She&mdash;oh, Lucy! you will be surprised&mdash;she is a Plymouth
sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rashe!&mdash;old Rashe!&nbsp; We reverse the old
transformation, butterflies into grubs!&rsquo; cried Lucy, with
somewhat spasmodic laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me how the wonder
came about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know little about it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Miss Charlecote thought most likely it was the first
earnest kind of religion that presented itself when she was
craving for some such help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did Honor make such a liberal remark?&nbsp; There, I am
sorry I said it; but let me hear of dear old Rashe.&nbsp; Has it
made her very grim?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know it is not an embellishing dress, and she did
look gaunt and haggard; but still somehow we liked her better
than ever before; and she is so very good and
charitable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&nbsp; Nice is a grand place for colporteurs and
tracts.&nbsp; She would be a shining specimen there, and
dissipation, religious or otherwise, old Rashe <i>must</i>
have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not only in that line,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
suppressing a smile at the truth of the surmise, &lsquo;but she
is all kindness to sick English&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She tried to convert you all!&mdash;confess it.&nbsp;
Rashe converting dear old Honor!&nbsp; Oh! of all comical
conjunctions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote hushed it down,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;and, indeed, nobody could be with her and
think that she needed rousing to religious thoughts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By this attempt on Honor, I fear she has not succeeded
with Lolly, whom poor Owen used to call an Eastern woman with no
soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does everything for Mrs. Charteris&mdash;dresses
her, works for her&mdash;I do believe cooks for her.&nbsp; They
live a strange, rambling life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard Lolly plays as deeply as Charles, does not
she?&nbsp; All Castle Blanch mortgaged&mdash;would be sold, but
that Uncle Kit is in the entail!&nbsp; It breaks one&rsquo;s
heart to hear it!&nbsp; They all live on generous old Ratia, I
suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe she pays the bills when they move.&nbsp; We
were told that it was a beautiful thing to see how patiently and
resolutely she goes on bearing with them and helping them, always
in hopes that at last they may turn to better things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucy was much touched.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Rashe!&rsquo; she
said; &lsquo;there was something great in her.&nbsp; I have a
great mind to write to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They diverged into other subjects, but every minute she became
more open and confidential; and as the guarded reserve <!-- page
465--><a name="page465"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
465</span>wore off, Ph&oelig;be contrived to lead to the question
of her spirits and health, and obtained a fuller answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Till you try, Ph&oelig;be, you can&rsquo;t guess the
wear of living with minds that have got nothing in them but what
you have put in yourself.&nbsp; There seems to be a fur growing
over one&rsquo;s intellects for want of something to rub
against.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fennimore must often have felt that with
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you were older and besides, you have some
originality in a sober way; and don&rsquo;t imagine Miss
Fennimore had the sore heart at the bottom&mdash;the foolishness
that took to moaning after home as soon as it had cast it off
past recall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lucy! not past recall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not past pardon, I am trying to hope.&nbsp; At least,
there are some people who, the more unpardonable one is, pardon
the more readily.&nbsp; When Owen comes home, I mean to
try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I saw you had been going through a great
deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t charge my looks on
sentiment,&rsquo; said Cilla, hastily; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
plenty to account for them besides.&nbsp; One never falls into
those foibles when one is quite strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you have been unwell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to the point of giving in.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never say die&rdquo; was always my motto, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To what point, dear Lucy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To that of feeling as if the entire creation was out of
joint&mdash;not one child here and there, but everybody was
cross; and I could not walk with the children, and my bones
ached, and all that sort of thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had advice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I thought it economical to patch myself up in
time; so I asked for a holiday to go to the doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did after the nature of doctors; poked me about, and
asked if there were decline in the family;&rsquo; and in spite of
the smile, the great blue eyes looked ghastly; &lsquo;and he
forbade exertion, and ordered good living and cod-liver
oil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then surely you should be taking care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I am.&nbsp; These are very good-natured people, and
I&rsquo;m a treasure of a governess, you know.&nbsp; I have
refections ten times a day, and might swim in port wine, and the
little Swiss <i>bonne</i> walks the children, and gives them an
awful accent, which their mamma thinks the correct
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Change&mdash;rest&mdash;you should have
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall, when Owen comes.&nbsp; It is summer-time, and
I shall hold on till then, when it will be plenty of time to see
whether this is nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether what is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About my lungs.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look horrified.&nbsp;
He could only trace the remains of a stupid old cold, and if it
were more, I know of no fact of so little moment to
anybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not say that, Lucy; it is wrong and
cruel.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 466--><a name="page466"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
466</span>&lsquo;It is your fault; I did not want to have talked
of it, and in good time here comes half my flock.&nbsp; Edie,
Reggie, Flo, come and show Miss Fulmort what my torments
are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They ran in, apparently on excellent terms with her, and
greeted her guest without shyness; but after a little whispering
and shoving the youngest spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Edie and Reggie want
to know if she is the lady that put out the light?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you heroine,&rsquo; said Lucy, &lsquo;you
don&rsquo;t know how often I have told of your doughty
deeds!&nbsp; Ay, look at her, she is the robber-baffler; though
now I look at her I don&rsquo;t quite believe it
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is true?&rsquo; asked the little girl,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell us all the story,&rsquo; added the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; tell us,&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;I read
all your evidence, so like yourself as it was, but I want to know
where you were sleeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be found her present audience strangely more
embarrassing than the whole assize court, perhaps because there
the solemn purpose swallowed up the sense of admiration; but she
laughed at last at the boy&rsquo;s disappointment at the escape
of the thieves; &lsquo;he would have fired a pistol through the
keyhole and shot them!&rsquo;&nbsp; When she rose to go, the
children entreated her to stay and be seen by the others, but
this she was glad to escape, though Lucilla clung to her with a
sort of anguish of longing, yet stifled affection, that would
have been most painful to witness, but for the hopes for her
relief.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be ordered her brother&rsquo;s carriage in time to
take her to breakfast in Woolstone-lane the next morning, and
before ten o&rsquo;clock Honor had heard the account of the visit
in Essex.&nbsp; Tearfully she thanked the trusty reconnoitrer as
for a kindness to herself, dwelling on the tokens of relenting,
yet trembling at the tidings of the malady.&nbsp; To write and
recall her child to her motherly nursing was the foremost thought
in her strange medley of grief and joy, hope and fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Robert,&rsquo; she said, when she understood that
he had organized Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s mission; &lsquo;I am glad I
told him to give no answer for a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn told me how kind you were about
Hiltonbury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kind to myself, my dear.&nbsp; It seems like a crime
when I look at St. Matthew&rsquo;s; but when I think of you all,
and of home, I believe it is right that he should have the
alternative.&nbsp; And now, if poor Lucy come, and it be not too
late&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he say anything?&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only wrote to him; I thought he had rather not let me
see his first impulse, so I told him to let me hear nothing till
Thursday evening.&nbsp; I doubted before, now I feel sure he will
take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy has the oldest claim,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
thoughtfully, wishing she could feel equally desirous of success
in this affair as in that of Mervyn and Cecily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she was his first love, before
Whittingtonia.&nbsp; Did you mention the vacancy at
Hiltonbury?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 467--><a name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
467</span>&lsquo;No; there was so much besides to talk
of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is well; for perhaps if she knew, that spirit of
hers might keep her aloof.&nbsp; I feel like Padre Cristoforo
dispensing Lucia from her vow!&nbsp; If she will only get
well!&nbsp; And a little happiness will do more than all the cods
in Hammerfest!&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be, we will have a chapel-school at
the hamlet, and a model kitchen at the school: and Robert will
get hold of all the big boys.&nbsp; His London experience is
exactly what we want to brighten Hiltonbury, and all our
clergy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hiltonbury had a right to stand first with Honora, and
Whittingtonia had sunk into a mere training-school for her
pattern parson.&nbsp; If there were a sigh to think that Owen was
exactly of the right age to have been ordained to Hiltonbury, she
put it away, for this was next best.</p>
<p>Her note to Lucilla was penned with trembling caution, and
each word was reconsidered day and night, in case the perverse
temper might take umbrage.&nbsp; The answer came.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Honor</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is beyond my deserts to be so kindly taken
home.&nbsp; I have learnt what that means now.&nbsp; I can be
spared for a fortnight; and as Mr. Bostock dines in town the day
after to-morrow, he will set me down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your
affectionate</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">L.
Sandbrook</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote is like a person ten years
younger,&rsquo; observed Bertha to Ph&oelig;be, when she came
with the rest to &lsquo;quite a family party,&rsquo; at
Albury-street.&nbsp; Robert alone was absent, it being what
Augusta called &lsquo;a fast or something;&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> a
meeting of St. Wulstan&rsquo;s Young Men&rsquo;s Institute.&nbsp;
Bertha heartily wished she could call herself a young man, for
her morbid sense of disgrace always recurred with those whom she
knew to be cognizant of her escapade.&nbsp; However, this evening
made a change in her ladyship&rsquo;s views, or rather she had
found Ph&oelig;be no longer the mere submissive handmaid of
schoolroom days, but a young woman accustomed to liberty of
action and independence of judgment; and though perfectly
obliging and unselfish, never admitting Augusta&rsquo;s claims on
her time to the exclusion of those of others of the family, and
quietly but decidedly carrying out her intentions.&nbsp;
Bertha&rsquo;s shrinking silence and meekness of demeanour
persuaded her sister that she would be more comfortable, and her
womanly appearance not only rendered the notion of school
ridiculous, but inspired the desire of bringing her out.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be might dedicate herself to Maria if she pleased;
Bertha should shine through the season under her sister&rsquo;s
patronage.</p>
<p>Not since the adventure with the Hy&egrave;res peasants had
Bertha&rsquo;s tongue been so unmanageable, as when she tried to
protest against going into society; and when Mervyn came to her
help, Augusta owned that such hesitation was indeed an <!-- page
468--><a name="page468"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
468</span>objection, but it might easily be cured by good
management; cordials would prevent nervousness, and, after all,
no one would care when a girl had such a fortune.&nbsp; Poor
Bertha crept away, feeling as if she could never open her mouth
again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mervyn and Augusta amicably agreed on the excellence
of Hiltonbury parsonage as a home for the girls, the latter only
regretting what Robert had sunk on his fancies at
Whittingtonia.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rsquo;
returned Mervyn; &lsquo;all I regret is, that we never took our
share.&nbsp; It is a different thing now, I assure you, to see
the turn out from the distillery since the lads have come under
his teaching!&nbsp; I only hope his successor may do as
well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t understand about such
things,&rsquo; said Augusta, crossly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor papa
never made such a rout about the hands.&nbsp; It would not have
been thought good taste to bring them forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you wish to understand,&rsquo; said Mervyn,
maliciously, &lsquo;you had better come and see.&nbsp; Robert
would be very glad of your advice for the kitchen he is setting
going&mdash;sick cookery and cheap dinners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray who pays for them?&nbsp; Robert has made
himself a beggar.&nbsp; Is it you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; those who eat.&nbsp; It is to be
self-supporting.&nbsp; I do nothing but lend the house.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t remember it.&nbsp; It is the palace at the corner of
Richard Alley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no concern of mine, I know; but what is to become
of the business if you go giving away the houses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I am getting into the foreign and exportation
line.&nbsp; It is infinitely less bother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well!&nbsp; I am glad my poor father does not see
it.&nbsp; He would have said the business was going to the
dogs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he was fast coming into Robert&rsquo;s views, and I
heartily wish I had not hindered him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Augusta told her admiral that evening that there was no hope
for the family, since Robert had got hold of Mervyn as well as of
the rest of them.&nbsp; People in society actually asked her
about the schools and playground at Mr. Fulmort&rsquo;s
distillery; there had been an educational report about
them.&nbsp; Quite disgusting!</p>
<p>There passed a day of conflicting hope and fear, soothed by
the pleasure of preparation, and at seven in the evening there
came the ring at the house door, and Lucilla was once more in
Honora&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; It was for a moment a convulsive
embrace, but it was not the same lingering clinging as when she
met Ph&oelig;be, nor did she look so much changed as then, for
there was a vivid tint of rose on either cheek; she had restored
her hair to the familiar fashion, and her eyes were bright with
excitement.&nbsp; The presence of Maria and Bertha, which Miss
Charlecote had regretted, was probably a relief; for Lucilla, as
she threw off her bonnet, and sat down to the &lsquo;severe
tea&rsquo; <!-- page 469--><a name="page469"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 469</span>awaiting her, talked much to them,
observed upon their growth, noticed the little Maltese dog, and
compared her continental experiences with Bertha&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
To Honor she scarcely spoke voluntarily, and cast down her eyes
as she did so, making brief work of answers to inquiries, and
showing herself altogether disappointingly the old Cilly.&nbsp;
Robert&rsquo;s absence was also a disappointment to Honor, though
she satisfied herself that it was out of consideration.</p>
<p>Lucy would not go up to her room till bed-time; and when
Honor, accompanying her thither, asked tender and anxious
questions about her health, she answered them, not indeed
petulantly, as of old, but with a strange, absent manner, as if
it were duty alone that made her speak.&nbsp; Only when Honor
spoke of her again seeing the physician whom she had consulted,
she at first sharply refused, then, as if recollecting herself,
meekly said: &lsquo;As you think fit, but I had rather it was not
the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought he was your own preference,&rsquo; said
Honor, &lsquo;otherwise I should have preferred Dr. F.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, let it be,&rsquo; said Lucy, hastily.</p>
<p>The good-nights, the kisses past, and Honor went away, with a
heavy load of thwarted hopes and baffled yearning at her
heart&mdash;yearnings which could be stilled only in one way.</p>
<p>A knock.&nbsp; She started up, and called &lsquo;Come
in,&rsquo; and a small, white, ghostly figure glided in, the
hands tightly clasped together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, dear child, you are ill!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with me,&rsquo;
said a husky, stifled voice; &lsquo;I meant it&mdash;I wanted
it.&nbsp; I longed after it when it was out of reach, but
now&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, my dear?&rsquo; asked Honor, appalled at the
effort with which she spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your pardon!&rsquo; and with a pressure of hands and
contraction of the brow as of physical agony, she exclaimed,
&lsquo;Honor, Honor, forgive me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor held out her arms, she flung herself prone into them,
and wept.&nbsp; Tears were with her an affection as violent as
rare, and her sobs were fearful, heaving her little fragile frame
as though they would rend it, and issuing in short cries and
gasps of anguish.&nbsp; Honor held her in her arms all the time,
much alarmed, but soothing and caressing, and in the midst,
Lucilla had not lost all self-control, and though unable to
prevent the paroxysm, restrained it as much as possible, and
never attempted to speak; but when her friend laid her down, her
whole person still quivering with the long swell of the last
uncontrollable sobbing, she looked up with the sweetest smile
ever seen by Honor, who could not help thinking that such a sight
might have met the eyes of the mother who found the devil gone
out and her daughter laid on the bed.</p>
<p>The peace was such that neither could bear to speak for many
seconds.&nbsp; At last Lucy said, &lsquo;Dear Honor.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 470--><a name="page470"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
470</span>&lsquo;My dearest&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lie down by me; please put your arms round me.&nbsp;
There!&nbsp; Oh! it is so comfortable.&nbsp; Why did I never find
it out before?&nbsp; I wish I could be a little child, and begin
again from the time my father made me over to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, we all would begin again if we could.&nbsp; I
have come to the perception how often I exasperated
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An angel who did his duty by me would have exasperated
me in your place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that was one error of mine.&nbsp; I thrust myself
in against the wishes of your nearest relative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My thanklessness has made you feel that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk on, dear one&mdash;you are exhausting
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little more I must say before I can sleep under your
roof in peace, then I will obey you in all things.&nbsp; Honor,
these few years have shown me what your education did for me
against my will.&nbsp; What would have become of me if I had been
left to the poor Castle Blanch people?&nbsp; Nothing could have
saved me but my spirit of contradiction!&nbsp; No; all that saved
my father&rsquo;s teaching from dying out in me&mdash;all that
kept me at my worst from the Charteris standard, all that has
served me in my recent life, was what you did for me!&nbsp;
There! I have told you only the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor could only kiss her and whisper something of
unlooked-for happiness, and Lucilla&rsquo;s tears flowed again at
the tenderness for which she had learnt to hunger; but it was a
gentle shower this time, and she let herself be hushed into
calmness, till she slept peacefully on Honor&rsquo;s bed, in
Honor&rsquo;s arms, as she had never done, even as a young
child.&nbsp; Honor watched her long, in quiet gladness and
thankfulness, then likewise slept; and when awakened at last by a
suppressed cough, looked up to see the two stars of blue eyes,
soft and gentle under their swollen lids, gazing on her full of
affection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have wakened you,&rsquo; Lucy said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been awake long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not very; but to lie and look at the old windows, and
smell the cedar fragrance, and see you, is better than
sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still the low morning cough and the pallor of the face filled
Honor with anxiety; and though Lucilla attributed much to the
night&rsquo;s agitation, she was thoroughly languid and unhinged,
and fain to lie on the sofa in the cedar parlour, owning that no
one but a governess could know the full charm of doing
nothing.</p>
<p>The physician was the same who had been consulted by her
father, and well remembered the flaxen-haired child whom he had
so cruelly detached from his side.&nbsp; He declared her to be in
much the same reduced and enfeebled condition as that in which
her father brought on his malady by reckless neglect and
exposure, and though he found no positive disease in progress, he
considered that all would depend upon anxious care, and complete
rest for the autumn and winter, and he thought her <!-- page
471--><a name="page471"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
471</span>constitution far too delicate for governess life,
positively forbidding her going back to her situation for another
day.</p>
<p>Honor had left the room with him.&nbsp; She found Lucilla with
her face hidden in the sofa cushions, but the next moment met a
tremulous half-spasmodic smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I humbled enough?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Failed, failed, failed!&nbsp; One by my flirting, two by
my temper, three by my health!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get my own
living, and necessity sends me home, without the grace of
voluntary submission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, my child, the very calling it home shows that it
need not humble you to return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very odd that I should like it so much!&rsquo;
said Lucy; &lsquo;and now,&rsquo; turning away as usual from
sentiment, &lsquo;what shall I say to Mrs. Bostock?&nbsp; What a
wretch she will think me!&nbsp; I must go over and see all those
children once more.&nbsp; I hope I shall have a worthy successor,
poor little rogues.&nbsp; I must rouse myself to
write!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not while you can sit and talk.&nbsp; I have so much to
hear of at home!&nbsp; I have never inquired after Mr.
Henderson!&nbsp; Not dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not heard?&nbsp; It was a very long, gradual
decay.&nbsp; He died on the 12th.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! he was a kind old man, and home will not be
itself without his white head in the reading-desk.&nbsp; Have you
filled up the living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have offered it&rsquo;&mdash;and there was a
pause&mdash;&lsquo;to Robert Fulmort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so!&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor durst not ask the grounds of this prediction, and the
rest of that family were discussed.&nbsp; It was embarrassing to
be asked about the reports of last winter, and Lucy&rsquo;s keen
penetration soon led to full confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I was sure that a great flood had passed over that
poor child!&nbsp; I was desperate when I wrote to Ph&oelig;be,
for it seemed incredible that it should be either of the others,
but I might have trusted her.&nbsp; I wonder what will become of
her.&nbsp; I have not yet seen the man good enough for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen one&mdash;and so have you&mdash;but I could
not have spared him to her, even if she had been in his
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Truly Lucilla was taken home when Honor was moved to speak
thus.</p>
<p>For her sake Honor had regretted that the return dinner to the
Albury-street household and the brothers was for this day, but
she revived towards evening, and joined the party, looking far
less pretty and piquante, and her dress so quiet as to be only
just appropriate, but still a fair bright object, and fitting so
naturally into her old place, that Lady Bannerman was scandalized
at her presumption and Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s weakness.&nbsp;
Honor and Ph&oelig;be both watched the greeting between her and
Robert, but could infer nothing, either from it or from their
<!-- page 472--><a name="page472"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
472</span>deportment at dinner, both were so entirely
unembarrassed and easy.&nbsp; Afterwards Robert sought out
Ph&oelig;be, and beguiled her into the window where his affairs
had so often been canvassed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I must do what I
fear will distress you, and I want to prepare you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was it coming?&nbsp; But how could he have guessed that she
had rather not?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel deeply your present homeless condition.&nbsp; I
wish earnestly that I could make a home for you.&nbsp; But,
Ph&oelig;be, once you told me you were content to be sacrificed
to my foremost duty&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I love this smoky old black wife of mine,
and don&rsquo;t want to leave her even for my sisters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never thought of your leaving her for your sisters,
but&mdash;&rsquo; and as Lucilla&rsquo;s music effectually veiled
all words&mdash;&lsquo;I had thought that there might be other
considerations.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her eyes spoke the rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you knew that folly had passed away,&rsquo;
he said, somewhat sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I trust that no one else
has thought of it!&rsquo; and he indicated Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not when the offer was made to you, but since she heard
of my mission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I am glad that on other grounds my mind was made
up.&nbsp; No,&rsquo; after a pause, &lsquo;there is a great
change.&nbsp; She is far superior to what she was in the days of
my madness, but it is over, and never could be renewed.&nbsp; She
herself does not desire it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was called to the piano, not sorry that such
should be Robert&rsquo;s conviction, and glad that he should not
be disturbed in work that suited him so well as did St.
Matthew&rsquo;s, but thinking him far too valuable for Lucy not
to suffer in losing her power over him.</p>
<p>And did she?</p>
<p>She was alone in the cedar parlour with Honor the next day,
when the note was brought in announcing his refusal on the ground
that while he found his strength and health equal to the calls of
his present cure, and his connection with the Fulmort firm gave
him unusual facilities in dealing with the workmen, he did not
think he ought to resign his charge for another for which many
better men might be found.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right; I knew it,&rsquo; said Lucilla, when Honor
had with some attempt at preparation shown her the note.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I saw a man in his vocation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A long silence, during which Cilly caught a pitying
glance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please to put that out of your head!&rsquo; she
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no pity, no ill-usage in
the case.&nbsp; I wilfully did what I was warned that he would
not bear, and there was an end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had hoped not past recall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you will have the truth, when it was done and
not <!-- page 473--><a name="page473"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 473</span>to be helped, we were both very
sorry; I can answer at least for one, but he had bound himself
heart and soul to his work, and does not care any longer for
me.&nbsp; What, you, the preacher of sacrifice, wishing to see
your best pupil throw up your pet work for the sake of a little
trumpery crushed fire-fly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Convict me out of my own mouth,&rsquo; said Honor,
sadly, &lsquo;it will not make me like to see my fire-fly
crushed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the poor fire-fly has lit the lamp of learning for
six idle children, no other cause for dimness need be
sought.&nbsp; No, I was well and wicked in the height of the
pain, and long after it wore out&mdash;for wear out it
did&mdash;and I am glad he is too wise to set it going
again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like emotions.&nbsp; I only want to be
let alone.&nbsp; Besides, he has got into such a region of
goodness, that his wife ought to be super-excellent.&nbsp; I know
no one good enough for him unless you would have him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As usual, Honor was balked by bestowing sympathy, and could
only wonder whether this were reserve, levity, or resignation,
and if she must accept it as a fact that in the one the
attachment had been lost in the duties of his calling, in the
other had died out for want of requital.&nbsp; For the present,
in spite of herself, her feeling towards Robert verged more on
distant rather piqued admiration than on affection, although he
nearly approached the ideal of her own first love, and Owen
Sandbrook&rsquo;s teaching was, through her, bearing good fruit
in him, even while recoiling on her woman&rsquo;s heart through
Owen&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>Mervyn was easily reconciled to the decision, not only because
his brother was even more valuable to him in London than in the
country, but because Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s next alternative was
Charlecote Raymond, Sir John&rsquo;s second son, a fine,
open-tempered young man of thirty, who had made proof of vigour
and judgment in the curacy that he had just left, and who had the
farther recommendation of bearing the name of the former squire,
his godfather.&nbsp; Anything called Raymond was at present so
welcome to Mervyn that he felt himself under absolute obligations
to Robert for having left the field clear.&nbsp; When no longer
prejudiced, the sight of Robert&rsquo;s practical labours struck
him more and more, and his attachment grew with his
admiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said,
when riding with her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a notion of pleasing
the parson.&nbsp; Yesterday we got obstructed by an interminable
procession of school children going out for a lark in the country
by an excursion train, and he began envying their keepers for
being able to give them such a bath of country air.&nbsp; Could
we not let him do the same by his lot at Beauchamp?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mervyn, what a mass of happiness you would
produce!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mass of humbug!&nbsp; I only want to please Robin and
have no trouble.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t come near it.&nbsp; You
only tell me what it will cost, carriage, provender, and all, and
let me hear no more of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was destined to hear a good deal more.&nbsp; The proposal
<!-- page 474--><a name="page474"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
474</span>caused the utmost gratitude and satisfaction, except
that Honor and Robert doubted whether it were a proper moment for
merry-making at Hiltonbury.&nbsp; They were in full consultation
when in walked Sir John Raymond, who could not help coming to
town at once to express his thanks at having his son settled so
near him.&nbsp; Ere long, he learnt what was under discussion,
and made the amendment that the place should be the Forest, the
occasion the Horticultural Show.&nbsp; He knew of a capital spot
for the whole troop to dine in, even including the Wulstonians
proper, whom Honor, wondering she had never thought of it before,
begged to include in the treat at her own expense.&nbsp; But
conveyance from the station for nearly two thousand?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Sir John; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
undertake for that!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make it a county concern,
and get the farmers to lend their wagons, borrow all the breaks
we can, and I know of some old stage-coaches in dock.&nbsp; If
there&rsquo;s not room for all, they must ride and tye.&nbsp; It
is only three miles from the little Forest station, and
we&rsquo;ll make the train stop there.&nbsp; Only, young ladies,
you must work Whittington&rsquo;s cat upon all the banners for
your kittens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla clapped her hands, and undertook that the
Whittingtonians should be marshalled under such an array of
banners as never were seen before.&nbsp; Maria was in ecstasies,
and Bertha was, in the excitement, forgetting her dread of
confronting the county.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where&rsquo;s Miss Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; asked Sir
John, who had sat half an hour waiting in vain for her to appear;
and when he heard, he declared his intention of calling on
her.&nbsp; And where was Mervyn himself?&nbsp; He was at the
office, whither Robert offered to conduct the Baronet, and where
Mervyn heard more of his proposal than he had bargained for;
though, perhaps, not more than he liked.&nbsp; He was going to an
evening party at the Bannermans&rsquo;, and seeing Sir
John&rsquo;s inclination to see Ph&oelig;be, proposed to call for
him and take him there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the use, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; demanded Lady
Bannerman, after the party was over, &lsquo;of my getting all
these young men on purpose to dance with you, if you get up in a
corner all the evening to talk to nobody but Mervyn and old Sir
John?&nbsp; It can be nothing but perverseness, for you are not a
bit shy, and you are looking as delighted as possible to have put
me out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to have put you out, Augusta, but I am
delighted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, at what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are asked to stay at Moorcroft, that&rsquo;s one
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stupid place.&nbsp; No wines, no dinners,&rsquo; said
Augusta; &lsquo;and so ridiculous as you are!&nbsp; If the son is
at home you&rsquo;ll do nothing but talk to Sir John.&nbsp; And
if ever a girl ought to get married off I am sure it is
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know what good use I may make of my
opportunities?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be positively danced up-stairs, and indulged in a
private <!-- page 475--><a name="page475"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 475</span>polka round her bedroom.&nbsp; She
had been told not only of the Forest plan, but that Sir John was
going to &lsquo;run down&rsquo; to his brother&rsquo;s at Sutton
the next day, and that he had asked Mervyn to come with him.</p>
<p>Mervyn had not this time promised to send her a blank
cover.&nbsp; He thought he had very little present hope, for the
talk had been of a year&rsquo;s probation&mdash;of his showing
himself a changed character, etc.&nbsp; And not only was this
only half that space, but less than a month had been spent in
England.&nbsp; This time he was not setting off as one about to
confer a favour.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be heard no more for two days.&nbsp; At last, as she
was finishing her toilette to go out with Augusta, a hasty knock
came to her door, and Mervyn entreated to be let in.&nbsp; His
face told more than his tongue could utter.&nbsp; He had little
guessed the intensity of the happiness of which he had so long
deprived himself, and Cecily&rsquo;s acceptance had filled him
with a flood of bliss, tinctured, however, by the sense of his
own unworthiness of her constant affection, and increasing
compunction for what he had made her endure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how she could do it, or why she
cared for such a miserable scamp, breaking her heart all this
time!&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will make up for it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I may; but, bless me, Ph&oelig;be, she is a
perfect little nun, and what is she to do with a graceless dog
like me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think, then?&rsquo; he demanded, in some
alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know I can&rsquo;t take to the pious
tack.&nbsp; Will nothing else satisfy her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not the same as you were.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
know what will happen to you yet,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
playfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The carriage is ready, ma&rsquo;am; my lady is
waiting,&rsquo; said a warning voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; quoth Mervyn, intercepting her,
&lsquo;not a word to my lady.&nbsp; It is all conditional, you
understand&mdash;only that I may ask again, in a year, or some
such infernal time, if I am I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;but
they do, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will by that time.&nbsp; Dear Mervyn, I am
sorry, but I must go, or Augusta will be coming here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made a ludicrous gesture of shrinking horror, but still
detained her to whisper, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll meet her at
Moorcroft; they will have her for the Forest to-do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be signed her extreme satisfaction, and ran away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am surprised at you, Ph&oelig;be; you have kept me
five minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some young ladies do worse,&rsquo; said the Admiral,
who was very fond of her; &lsquo;and her time was not lost.&nbsp;
I never saw her look better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like such a pair of milkmaid&rsquo;s
cheeks, looking so ridiculously delighted, too,&rsquo; said Lady
Bannerman, crossly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Really, Ph&oelig;be, one would
think you were but just come up from the country, and had never
been to a concert before.&nbsp; Those stupid little white
marabouts in your hair again, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 476--><a name="page476"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
476</span>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Sir Nicholas, &lsquo;I take
them as a compliment&mdash;Ph&oelig;be knows I think they become
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say they are amiss in themselves, but it
is all obstinacy, because I desire her to buy that magnificent
ruby bandeau!&nbsp; How is any one to believe in her fortune if
she dresses in that twopenny-halfpenny fashion?&nbsp; I declare I
have a great mind to leave her behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could almost have said &lsquo;pray do,&rsquo; so
much did she long to join the party in Woolstone-lane, where the
only alloy was, that poor Maria&rsquo;s incapacity for secrecy
forbade her hearing the good news.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote, likewise, was secretly a little scandalized
at the facility with which the Raymonds had consented to the
match; she thought Mervyn improved, but neither religious nor
repentant, and could not think Cecily or her family justified in
accepting him.&nbsp; Something of the kind became perceptible to
Robert when they first talked over the matter together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I really
believe that Mervyn will be more susceptible of real repentance
when he has imperceptibly been led to different habits and ways
of thinking.&nbsp; In many cases, I have seen that the mind has
to clear itself, and leave old things behind before it has the
capacity of perceiving its errors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Repentance must precede amendment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Some</i> repentance must, but even the sense of the
inexpedience and inconvenience of evil habits may be the first
step above them, and in time the power of genuine repentance may
be attained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, glad as I am for all your sakes, I cannot
understand it on Cecily&rsquo;s part, or how a girl of her tone
of mind can marry where there can as yet be no communion of the
highest kind.&nbsp; You would be sorry to see Ph&oelig;be do
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very sorry.&nbsp; It is no example, but there may be
claims from the mere length of the attachment, which seems to
mark her as the appointed instrument for his good.&nbsp; Besides,
she has not fully accepted him; and after such change as he has
made, she might not have been justified in denying all
encouragement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did not seek such justification,&rsquo; said Honor
laughing, but surprised to find Robert thus lenient in his
brother&rsquo;s case, after having acted so stern a part in his
own.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>
<blockquote><p>Then Robin Hood took them both by the hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And danced about the oak tree,<br />
For three merry men, and three merry men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And three merry men we be.&mdash;<i>Old
Ballad</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case of the three sisters remained a difficulty.&nbsp; The
Bannermans professed to have &lsquo;washed their hands of
them,&rsquo; their advice not being taken, and Mr. Crabbe could
not think <!-- page 477--><a name="page477"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 477</span>himself justified in letting them
return to the protection that had so egregiously failed.&nbsp;
Bertha was fretted by the uncertainty, and became nervous, and
annoyed with Ph&oelig;be for not showing more distress&mdash;but
going on from day to day in the confidence that matters would
arrange themselves.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, who had come of age during her foreign tour, had
a long conference with her guardian when he put her property into
her hands.&nbsp; The result was that she obtained his permission
to inhabit with her sisters the Underwood, a sort of
dowager-house belonging to Beauchamp, provided some elderly lady
could be found to chaperon them&mdash;Miss Fennimore, if they
preferred her.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore was greatly touched with the earnestness of the
united entreaties of her pupils, and though regretting the field
of usefulness in which she had begun to work, could not resist
the pleasure of keeping house with Ph&oelig;be, and resuming her
studies with Bertha on safer ground.&nbsp; She could not,
however, quit her employment without a half-year&rsquo;s notice,
and when Mervyn went down for a day to Beauchamp, he found the
Underwood in such a woful state of disrepair, that turn in as
many masons, carpenters, and paperers as he would, there was no
hope of its being habitable before Martinmas.&nbsp; Therefore the
intermediate time must be spent in visiting, and though the
head-quarters were at the Holt, the Raymonds of Moorcroft claimed
the first month, and the promise of Cecily&rsquo;s presence
allured Bertha thither, though the Fulmort mind had always
imagined the house highly religious and dull.&nbsp; Little had
she expected to find it ringing with the wild noise and nonsense
of a joyous home party of all ages, full of freaks and frolics,
laughter and merriment.&nbsp; Her ready wit would have made her
shine brilliantly if her speech had been constantly at command,
but she often broke down in the midst of a repartee, and was
always in danger of suffering from over-excitement.&nbsp; Maria,
too, needed much watching and tenderness.&nbsp; Every one was
very kind to her, but not exactly knowing the boundary of her
powers, the young people would sometimes have brought her into
situations to which she was unequal, if Ph&oelig;be had not been
constantly watching over her.</p>
<p>Between the two sisters, Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s visit was no
sinecure.&nbsp; She was always keeping a motherly eye and hand
over one or the other, sometimes over both, and not unseldom
incurring Bertha&rsquo;s resistance under the petulance of
overwrought spirits, or anger at troublesome precautions.&nbsp;
After Cecily&rsquo;s arrival, however, the task became
easier.&nbsp; Cecily took Bertha off her hands, soothing and
repressing those variable spirits, and making a wise and gentle
use of the adoration that Bertha lavished on her, keeping her
cousins in order, and obviating the fast and furious fun that was
too great a change for girls brought up like the Fulmorts.&nbsp;
Maria was safe whenever Cecily was in the room, and Ph&oelig;be
was able to relax her care and enjoy herself doubly for feeling
all the value of the future sister.</p>
<p><!-- page 478--><a name="page478"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
478</span>She thought Miss Charlecote and Lucilla both looked
worn and dispirited, when one day she rode with Sir John to see
them and inspect the Underwood, as well as to make arrangements
for the Forest Show.&nbsp; Poor Honora was seriously discomposed
at having nothing to show there.&nbsp; It was the first time that
the Holt had failed to shine in its produce, but old Brooks had
allowed the whole country round to excel so palpably in all farm
crops, and the gardener had taken things so easily in her
absence, that everything was mediocre, and she was displeased and
ashamed.&nbsp; Moreover, Brooks had controverted her strictest
instructions against harbouring tenants of bad character; he had
mismanaged the cattle, and his accounts were in confusion.&nbsp;
He was a thoroughly faithful servant, but like Ponto and the
pony, he had grown masterful with age.&nbsp; Honor found that her
presiding eye had certainly done some good, since going away had
made things so much worse, and she took Sir John with her to the
study to consult him on her difficulties.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be and
Lucilla were left together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you are not much better,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, looking at the languid fragile little being, and her
depressed air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;in
essentials&mdash;but, oh! Ph&oelig;be, if you could only teach me
to get on with Honor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, with a tone of
disappointment, &lsquo;I hoped all was comfortable
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it ought to be!&nbsp; I am a wretch that it is not;
but somehow I get tired to death.&nbsp; I should like it to be my
own fault, but with her I always have a sense of
<i>fluffiness</i>.&nbsp; There is so much figurativeness and
dreamy sentiment that one never gets to the firm, clear
surface.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought that her great charm,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a pity to be so dull and
unimaginative as I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like you best as you are!&nbsp; I know what to be
at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides, her sensibility and poetry are a fund of happy
youthfulness.&nbsp; Abroad, her enjoyment was multiplied, because
every place was full of associations, lighted up by her
fancy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Made unsubstantial by her fluff!&nbsp; No, I cannot
like mutton with the wool on!&nbsp; It is a shame, though, good
creature as she is!&nbsp; I only wanted to make out the
philosophy of the wearied, worried condition that her
conversation is so apt to bring on in me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
think it pure wickedness on my own part, for I esteem, and love,
and venerate the good soul with all my heart.&nbsp; I say,
Ph&oelig;be, were you never in an inward rage when she would say
she would not <i>let</i> some fact be true, for the sake of some
mythical, romantic figment?&nbsp; You smile.&nbsp; Own that you
have felt it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thought of Miss Fennimore&rsquo;s theory, that
legends are more veritable exponents of human nature than bare
facts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say it again, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; It sounds very
grand.&nbsp; Whipped cream is a truer exponent of milk than
cheese, especially when it tastes of soap-suds.&nbsp; Is that
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 479--><a name="page479"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
479</span>&lsquo;It is a much prettier thing, and not near so
hard and dry,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but, you see, you
are talking in figures after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The effect of example.&nbsp; Look here, my dear, the
last generation was that of medi&aelig;valism, ecclesiology,
chivalry, symbolism, whatever you may call it.&nbsp; Married
women have worked out of it.&nbsp; It is the middle-aged maids
that monopolize it.&nbsp; Ours is that of common
sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is better or
prettier,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it may be worse!&nbsp; But how are the two to live
together when there is no natural conformity&mdash;only
undeserved benefits on one side and gratitude on the
other?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will be more at ease when you are stronger and
better,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your brother will
make you feel more natural with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it, Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Think of the
scene those two will get up!&nbsp; And the showing him that
terrible little Cockney, Hoeing, as the old woman calls
him.&nbsp; If I could only break the neck of his h&rsquo;s before
poor Owen hears them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote did say something of having him here,
but she thought you were not strong enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Justly judged!&nbsp; I shall have enough of him by and
by, if I take him out to Canada.&nbsp; Once I used to think that
would be deliverance; now it has become nothing but a gigantic
trouble!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are really equal to it, you will not feel it so,
when the time comes.&nbsp; Bertha was miserable at the thought of
moving, till just when she had come to the right point, and then
she grew eager for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was wonderful how much freshened Lucy was by this brief
contact with Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s clear, practical mind; but only
for the time.&nbsp; Ever since her arrival at the Holt she had
sadly flagged, though making every effort against her
depression.&nbsp; There was something almost piteous in her
obedience and submission.&nbsp; All the employments once pressed
upon her and then spurned, were solicitously resumed; or if Honor
remonstrated against them as over-fatiguing, were relinquished in
the same spirit of resigned meekness.&nbsp; Her too visible
desire to make an onerous atonement pressed with equal weight on
both, and the essential want of sympathy rendered the confidences
of the one mysteries to the other.</p>
<p>Honora was grieved that her child had only returned to pine
and droop, charging much of her melancholy lassitude upon Robert,
and waiting on her with solicitude and tenderness that were
unhappily only an additional oppression; and all Lucilla&rsquo;s
aversion to solitude did not prevent her friend&rsquo;s absence
from being a relief.&nbsp; It was all that she could at present
desire to be released from the effort of being companionable, and
be able to indulge her languor without remark, her wayward
appetite without causing distress, and her dejection without
caresses, commiseration, or secret imputations on Robert.</p>
<p>Tidings came from Vancouver&rsquo;s Land of her uncle&rsquo;s
death by <!-- page 480--><a name="page480"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 480</span>an accident.&nbsp; Long as it was
since she had seen him, the loss was deeply felt.&nbsp; She
better appreciated what his care of her father had been, and knew
better what gratitude he deserved, and it was a sore
disappointment that he should not live to see her prove her
repentance for all her flightiness and self-will.&nbsp; Moreover,
his death, without a son, would enable his nephew to alienate the
family estate; and Lucy looked on this as direful shame and
humiliation.&nbsp; Still there was something soothing in having a
sorrow that could be shared with Miss Charlecote; and the
tangible cause for depression and retirement was a positive
comfort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trouble&rsquo; was the chief dread of her wearied
spirit; and though she had exerted herself to devise and work the
banners, she could not attempt being present at the grand Forest
show, and marvelled to see Honor set off, with twice her years
and more than twice her sorrows, yet full of the fresh eagerness
of youthful anticipation, and youthful regrets at leaving her
behind, and at having nothing to figure at the show!</p>
<p>But vegetables were not the order of that day, the most
memorable the Forest had perhaps ever known, since six bold
Lancastrian outlaws had there been hung, on the very knoll where
the flag of England was always hoisted, superior to the flags of
all the villages.</p>
<p>The country population and the exhibitors were all early in
the field, and on the watch for the great feature of the
day&mdash;the Londoners.&nbsp; What cheering rent the air as the
first vehicle from the little Forest station appeared, an old
stage-coach, clustered within and without by white bibs, tippets,
and caps, blue frocks, and grave, demure faces, uncertain whether
to be charmed or frightened at their elevation and reception, and
almost dazzled by the bright sunshine and pure air, to their
perception absolutely thin, though heavy laden with the scents of
new-mown hay and trodden ferns.</p>
<p>The horses are stopped, down springs Mr. Parsons from the box,
releases the staid mistress from within, lifts or jumps down the
twenty girls, and watches them form in well-accustomed file,
their banner at their head, just pausing to be joined by the
freight of a rattling omnibus, the very roof laden with the like
little Puritan damsels.&nbsp; The conveyances turn back for
another load, the procession is conducted slowly away, through
the road lined by troops of country children, regarding the
costume as the latest London fashion, and holding out many an
eager gift of nosegays of foxgloves, marigolds, southernwood, and
white pinks.&nbsp; Meanwhile break, cart, fly, van, barouche,
gig, cart, and wagon continue in turn to discharge successive
loads, twenty children to each responsible keeper.&nbsp; White
caps are over!&nbsp; Behold the parish school of St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here <i>is</i> fashion!&nbsp; Here are
hats, polkas, and full short skirts, but pale faces and small
limbs.&nbsp; The country mothers cry &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Poor little dears, they look very tuly,&rsquo; and
complacently regard their own <!-- page 481--><a
name="page481"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 481</span>sturdy,
sunburnt offspring, at whose staring eyes and ponderous boots the
city mice glance with disdain.</p>
<p>Endless stream!&nbsp; Here waves a proud blue banner, wrought
with a noble tortoiseshell cat; and behind it, each class led by
a cat-flag, marches the Whittingtonian line, for once no ragged
regiment, but arrayed by their incumbent&rsquo;s three sisters in
lilac cotton and straw bonnets, not concealing, however, the
pinched and squalid looks of the denizens of the over-crowded
lanes and alleys.</p>
<p>That complaint cannot be made of these sixteen wearers of gray
frocks and checked jackets.&nbsp; Stunted indeed they are,
several with the expressionless, almost featureless, visages of
hereditary misery, others with fearfully refined loveliness, but
all are plump, well-fed, and at ease.&nbsp; They come from the
orphanage of St. Matthew&rsquo;s, under the charge of the two
ladies who walk with them, leading two lesser younglings, all but
too small to be brought to the festival.&nbsp; Yes, these are the
waifs and strays, of home and parents absolutely unknown, whom
Robert Fulmort has gathered from the streets&mdash;his most
hopeful conquest from the realm of darkness.</p>
<p>Here, all neatly, some stylishly dressed, are the St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s Young Women&rsquo;s Association, girls from
fifteen upwards, who earn their own livelihood in service or by
their handiwork, but meet on Sunday afternoons to read, sing, and
go to church together, have books lent out for the week, or
questions set for those who like them.&nbsp; It is Miss Fennimore
who is the nucleus of the band; she sits with them in church, she
keeps the books, writes the questions, and leads the singing; and
she is walking between her two chief friends, answering their
eager and intelligent questions about trees and flowers, and
directing their observation.</p>
<p>Boys! boys! boys!&nbsp; Objects in flat caps and little round
buttons atop, knee-breeches, and short-tailed coats, funnier to
look at than their white-capped sisters, gentlemanly choristers,
tidy sons of artisans and warehousemen, ragged half-tamed little
street vagabonds, all file past, under curate, schoolmaster or
pupil teacher, till the whole multitude is safely deposited in a
large mead running into the heart of the Forest, and belonging to
the ranger, Sir John Raymond, who has been busy there, with all
his family, for the last three days.</p>
<p>Policemen guard the gates from intruders, but all can look
over the low hedge at the tents at either end, the cord dividing
boy from girl, and the scattered hay, on which the strangers move
about, mostly mazed by the strange sights, sounds, and smells,
and only the petted orphans venturing to tumble about that
curious article upon the ground.&nbsp; Two little sisters,
however, evidently transplanted country children, sit up in a
corner where they have found some flowers, fondling them and
hugging them with ecstasy.</p>
<p>The band strikes up, and, at the appointed signal, grace is
<!-- page 482--><a name="page482"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
482</span>said by the archdeacon from the centre, the children
are seated on the grass, and &lsquo;the nobility, clergy, and
gentry&rsquo; rush to the tents, and emerge with baskets of
sandwiches of the largest dimensions, or cans full of Sir
John&rsquo;s beer.&nbsp; The Whittingtonians devour as those that
have eaten nothing this morning, the Wulstonites as though
country air gave great keenness of appetite; the subdued silence
of awe passes off, and voices, laughing, and play begin to betray
some real enjoyment and familiarity.</p>
<p>Such as are not too perfectly happy in the revelry of tumbling
on the grass are then paraded through the show, to gaze at peas,
currants, and potatoes, pyramids of geraniums, and roses peeping
through white paper.&nbsp; Thence the younger ones return to play
in the field; such of the elder ones as prefer walking are
conducted through forest paths to gather flowers, and to obtain a
closer view of that oft-described sight, a corn-field.&nbsp; Some
of the elder Wulstonians get up a dance, tall girls dancing
together with the utmost enjoyment; but at four o&rsquo;clock the
band plays <i>Dulce Domum</i>, the captains of twenties count
heads and hunt up stragglers, all gather together in their
places, plum buns and tea are administered till even these
thirsty souls can drink no more.&nbsp; Again the files are
marshalled, the banners displayed, and the procession moves
towards the little Forest church, a small, low-walled,
high-roofed building, enclosed by stately beeches, making a sort
of outer cathedral around the little elevation where it stood in
its railed-in churchyard.</p>
<p>Two thousand children besides spectators in a building meant
for three hundred!&nbsp; How came it to be devised?&nbsp; There
is a consultation among the clergy.&nbsp; They go from one
portion to another of the well-generalled army, and each division
takes up a position on the ground strewn with dry beech leaves;
hassocks and mats are brought to the ladies, a desk set at the
gate, and a chair for the archdeacon; the choristers are brought
near, and the short out-door service is begun.</p>
<p>How glorious and full the responses, &lsquo;as the voice of
many waters,&rsquo; and the chanted Psalms, the beautiful songs
of degrees of the 27th of the month, rise with new fulness and
vividness of meaning among the tall trees and sunlit
foliage.&nbsp; One lesson alone is read, in Charlecote
Raymond&rsquo;s fine, powerful voice, and many an eye is filled
with tears at the words, &lsquo;One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,
one God and Father of us all,&rsquo; as he gazes on the troops on
troops of young and old, rich and poor, strangers and homeborn,
all held together in that great unity, typified by the
overshadowing sky, and evidenced by the burst of the Creed from
every voice and every heart.</p>
<p>Then follow the Versicles, the Collects, the Thanksgiving, and
the Blessing, and in a few warm, kind words the archdeacon calls
on all to keep the bond of peace and brotherly love, and bade the
strangers bear home with them the thought of the wonderful works
of God.&nbsp; Then&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 483--><a name="page483"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 483</span>All people that on earth do
dwell,<br />
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>arises from the congregation in all its simple exultant
majesty, forcing, as it were, every voice to break forth into
singing unless it be choked by heart-swelling.</p>
<p>The last note has died away, but there is a sweet hush, as
though lingering still, ere breaking the sense that this is none
other than the gate of heaven.</p>
<p>Rattle and rumble, the vehicles are coming!&nbsp; The children
rise, and somewhere begins the indispensable cheer.&nbsp; The
gentlemen take the lead.&nbsp; &lsquo;Three times three for Mr.
Fulmort!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Three cheers for Sir John
Raymond!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Three for the Forest
show!&rsquo;&nbsp; Shouting and waving of hats will never cease,
the gentlemen are as crazy as the boys, and what will become of
the train?</p>
<p>Tumble them in&mdash;hoist up the girls while mankind is still
vociferous.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all this, coming in at the omnibus
windows?&nbsp; Stand back, child, you don&rsquo;t want to be set
down in London!&nbsp; Your nosegay, is it?&nbsp; Here are the
prize nosegays, prize potatoes, prize currants, prize everything
showering in on the Londoners to display or feast on at
home.&nbsp; Many a family will have a first taste of fresh
country green meat to-morrow, of such freshness, that is, as it
may retain after eight hours of show and five of train.&nbsp; But
all is compared!&nbsp; How the little girls hug their
flowers.&nbsp; If any nosegays reach London alive, they will be
cherished to their last hour, and maybe the leaves will live in
prayer-books for many a year.</p>
<p>Poor little things!&nbsp; It has been to them apparently a
rather weary and oppressive pleasure, too strange for the most
part to be thoroughly enjoyed; but it will live in their memories
for many a day, and as time goes on, will clear itself from the
bewilderment, till it become one of the precious days that make
gems on the thread of life.</p>
<p>Mervyn!&nbsp; Where has he been all this time?&nbsp; True, he
once said he would see nothing of it, and seems to have kept his
word.&nbsp; He did not even acknowledge the cheers for Mr.
Fulmort.</p>
<p>Is not something visible behind the broad smooth bole of
yonder beech tree?&nbsp; Have Mervyn and Cecily been there all
the time of the evening service?</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact, that though nobody has told anybody,
every person who is curious, and many who are not, know who is to
be Mrs. Fulmort of Beauchamp.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There was some truth in Lucilla&rsquo;s view of herself and
Honor as belonging to two distinct classes of development.&nbsp;
Honor had grown up among those who fed on Scott, Wordsworth, and
Fouqu&eacute;, took their theology from the <i>British
Critic</i>, and their taste from Pugin; and moulded their
opinions and practice on the past.&nbsp; Lucilla and Ph&oelig;be
were essentially of the new generation, that of Kingsley,
Tennyson, Ruskin, and the <i>Saturday Review</i>.&nbsp; Chivalry
had given way to common sense, romance to realism, respect for
antiquity to pitying patronage, the past to the future.&nbsp;
Perhaps the present has lost in reverence and refinement as much
as it has gained in clearness and confidence!&nbsp; Lucilla
represented reaction, therefore her attitude was antagonistic;
Ph&oelig;be was the child of the newer system, therefore she
loved the elder one, and sought out the likenesses to, rather
than the differences from, her own tone of thought.&nbsp; And
well was it that she had never let slip her hold on that broad,
unchanging thread of truth, the same through all changes, making
faith and principle one, though the developments in practice and
shades of thought shake off the essential wisdom on which it
grew, only to adopt some more fatal aberration of their own!</p>
<p>Thus standing between the two, Ph&oelig;be was a great help to
both in understanding each other, and they were far more at ease
when she was with them.&nbsp; In October, all three went to
Woolstone-lane for a brief stay.&nbsp; Honor wished that the
physician should see Lucilla before the winter, and Ph&oelig;be
was glad to avail herself of the opportunity of choosing
furniture and hiring servants for her new establishment, free
from the interference of Lady Bannerman, who was of course at
Brighton.</p>
<p>She had been obliged to let her sisters go to Sutton without
her, as the little parsonage had not room for three guests
besides Lieschen, who was more indispensable to Maria than even
herself, and both the others were earnestly set upon accepting
the invitation.&nbsp; Cecily silenced her scruples by begging, as
a proof of acceptance as a sister, that she might be intrusted
with them, and promising that in her own quiet home, whence most
of the family had been launched into life, they should meet with
none of the excitements of merry Moorcroft; and Ph&oelig;be was
obliged to resign her charge for these few weeks, and trust from
Bertha&rsquo;s lively letters that all was well.</p>
<p><!-- page 485--><a name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
485</span>Another cause which made Honor and Lucy anxious to be
in London was the possibility of Owen&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; He
had last been heard of on the shores of Lake Superior, when he
spoke of returning as soon as the survey for a new line of
railway should have been completed, and it was not unlikely that
he might come even before his letter.&nbsp; News would await him
that he would regret as much as did his sister.&nbsp; Uncle
Kit&rsquo;s death had enabled Charles Charteris, or rather his
creditors, to advertise Castle Blanch for sale, and Lucilla, who
had a more genuine affection for the place than had any of the
natives, grieved extremely over the family disgrace that was
causing it to pass into other hands.</p>
<p>She had an earnest desire to take advantage of the display of
the house and grounds to pay the scenes of her youth one last
visit.&nbsp; The vehemence of this wish was her first recurrence
to her old strength of will, and Honora beheld it as a symptom of
recovery, though dreading the long and fatiguing day of
emotion.&nbsp; Yet it might be taken as another token of
improvement that she had ceased from that instinctive caution of
feebleness which had made her shrink from all exertion or
agitation.</p>
<p>Her chest was pronounced to be in a satisfactory state, her
health greatly improved; and as there was no longer need for
extra precaution, the three ladies set forth together on the
first fine day.</p>
<p>The Indian summer was in full glory, every wood arrayed in
brightness; and as they drove from the Wrapworth Station, the
banks of the river were surpassingly lovely, brown, red, and
olive, illuminated by sprays of yellow, like fireworks, and
contrasting with the vivid green of the meadows and dark blue
water.&nbsp; Honor recollected the fairy boat that once had
floated there, and glancing at the pale girl beside her, could
not but own the truth of the similitude of the crushed fire-fly;
yet the fire of those days had scorched, not lighted; and it had
been the mirth that tendeth to heaviness.</p>
<p>Cilla was gazing, with all her soul in her eyes, in
silence.&nbsp; She was trying to revive the sense of home that
once had made her heart bound at the first glimpse of Wrapworth;
but her spirit leapt up no more.&nbsp; The familiar scene only
impressed the sense of homelessness, and of the severance of the
last tie to her father&rsquo;s parish, her mother&rsquo;s native
place.&nbsp; Honor asked if she would stop in the village.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;let us have the Castle
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the next turn they overtook Mr. Prendergast, and he was
instantly at the carriage-door, exacting a willing promise of
taking luncheon with him on the way back, a rest for which Honor
was thankful, sure as she was that this visit was costing Lucy
more than she had anticipated.</p>
<p>Without a word, she beheld the green space of park, scattered
with groups of glowing trees, the elms spangled with gold, the
maples blushing themselves away, the parterre a gorgeous
patchwork of scarlet, lilac, and orange, the Virginian creeper
<!-- page 486--><a name="page486"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
486</span>hanging a crimson mantle on the cloister.&nbsp; There
was something inexpressibly painful in the sight of all this
beauty, unheeded and cast away by the owners, and displayed as a
matter of bargain and sale.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be thought of the
strange, uncomfortable dream that it had been to her when she had
before looked and wondered at the scene before her.&nbsp; She
retraced Robert&rsquo;s restless form in every window, and
thought how little she had then augured the fruit of what he had
suffered.</p>
<p>The rooms were opened, and set out for inspection.&nbsp; Honor
and Ph&oelig;be made it their duty to occupy the chattering maid,
a stranger to Lucilla, and leave her free to move through the
apartments, silent and very white, as if it were a sacred duty to
stand wherever she had stood, to gaze at whatever her eyes had
once met.</p>
<p>Presently she stood still, in the dining-room, her hand
grasping the back of a chair, as she looked up to a large picture
of three children, two boys and a girl, fancifully dressed, and
playing with flowers.&nbsp; The waxen complexion, fair hair, and
blue eyes of the girl were almost her own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This to be sold?&rsquo; she said, turning round, and
speaking for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, ma&rsquo;am!&mdash;everything,
unreservedly.&nbsp; That picture has been much admired&mdash;by
the late Sir Thomas Lawrence, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;the children of
the late General Sir Christopher Charteris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla, whiter than before, walked quickly away.&nbsp; In a
few seconds Ph&oelig;be followed, and found her leaning on the
balustrade of the terrace, her breathing heavily oppressed; but
she smiled coldly and sternly, and tightened a stiff, cold grasp
on Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s arm as she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor has her revenge, Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp; These are the
kindred for whom I broke from her!&nbsp; Well, if Charles sells
his birthright and his own father, I don&rsquo;t know how I can
complain of his selling my mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Lucy, listen.&nbsp; Miss Charlecote was asking
about the agent.&nbsp; I am sure she means to try to get it for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say.&nbsp; It is right that I should bear
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the maid said that there had been a gentleman
speaking about it, and trying to secure it.&nbsp; She thought he
had written to Mr. Charteris about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What gentleman?&rsquo; and Lucy was ready to spring
back to inquire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote asked, and I believe it was Mr.
Prendergast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a bright, though strange flickering of pleasure and
pain over Cilla&rsquo;s face, and her eyelids quivered as she
said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;of course; but he must
not&mdash;he must not do it!&nbsp; He cannot afford it!&nbsp; I
cannot let him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps your cousin only needed to be
reminded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no hope of him.&nbsp; Besides, he cannot help
himself; but at least&mdash;I say, Ph&oelig;be, tell Honor that
it is kindness itself in her; but I can&rsquo;t talk about it to
her&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 487--><a name="page487"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
487</span>And Lucilla&rsquo;s steps sprang up-stairs, as desirous
to escape the sight and speech of all.</p>
<p>After the melancholy round of deserted bedrooms, full of
bitter recollections, Lucilla again descended first, and at the
door met the curate.&nbsp; After a few words, she turned, and
said, &lsquo;Mr. Prendergast would row us down to the vicarage,
if you liked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, my dear,&rsquo; said Honor, unwillingly,
&lsquo;I am afraid of the cold on the water for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then pray let me walk across the park!&rsquo; she said
imploringly; and Miss Charlecote yielded rather than try her
submission too severely, though dreading her over-fatigue, and
set off with Ph&oelig;be in the fly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure it is not too far for you?&rsquo; asked
the curate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite.&nbsp; You know I always used to fly upon
Wrapworth turf.&rsquo;&nbsp; After some silence&mdash;&lsquo;I
know what you have been doing,&rsquo; she said, with a choking
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About the picture?&nbsp; I am sorry you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of no use for you to know that your cousin has no
more heart than a lettuce run to seed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I knew that before, why may I not know that there
are others not in the same case?&rsquo; she said, with full heart
and eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because the sale must take place, and the purchaser may
be a brute, so it may end in disappointment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t end in disappointment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be far beyond my means,&rsquo; continued the
curate, as if he had been answering her importunities for a new
doll.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I know it is,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it
can be done at all, the doing of it may be left to Miss
Charlecote&mdash;it is an expiation I owe to her generous
spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would rather she did it than I?&rsquo; he asked,
mortified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I tell you that I let her do it
as an expiation.&nbsp; Does not that prove what it costs
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why not&mdash;&rsquo; he began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; she interrupted, &lsquo;in the first
place, you have no idea of the price of Lawrence&rsquo;s
portraits; and, in the second, it is so natural that you should
be kind to me that it costs even my proud spirit&mdash;just
nothing at all&rsquo;&mdash;and again she looked up to him with
beamy, tearful eyes, and quivering, smiling lip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, it is still a bore to live with Miss
Charlecote,&rsquo; cried he, in his rough eagerness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t use such words,&rsquo; she answered,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is all kindness and forgiveness, and
what can it be but my old vixen spirit that makes this hard to
bear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 488--><a name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
488</span>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a great mind to tell you why I came to
Southminster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To look at a living?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To look at you.&nbsp; If I had found you pining and
oppressed, I had thought of asking if you could put up with your
father&rsquo;s old friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked with eyes of wonder, drew her arm away, and stood
still, partly bewildered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rsquo;
she said, half in interrogation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw my mistake; you were too young and gay.&nbsp;
But, Cilla,&rsquo; he added, more tremulously, &lsquo;if you do
wish for a home&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t have you talk as if I only wanted a home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And indeed I have none as yet,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But do you indeed mean that you could think of
it?&rsquo;&mdash;and he came nearer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It!&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; Of you!&rsquo; she vehemently
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;How could you think of anything
else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cilla,&rsquo; he said, in great agitation, &lsquo;let
me know what you are saying.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t drive me crazy
when it is not in the nature of things you should mean
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; asked Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is only
too good for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it true, then?&rsquo; he said, as he took both her
hands in his.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it true that you understand me, and
are willing to be&mdash;to be my own&mdash;darling
charge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it would be such rest!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was as if the storm-tossed bird was folding its weary wing
in perfect calm and confidence.&nbsp; Nor could he contain his
sudden joy, but spoke incoherent words, and well-nigh wept over
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you come to think of it?&rsquo; exclaimed she,
as, the first gush of feeling over, they walked on
arm-in-arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought of it from the moment when I hoped I might be
a resource, a comforter at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not before?&rsquo; was the rather odd question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; The place was forlorn enough without you; but
I was not such a fool as to think of a young beauty, and all
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>All that</i> meaning my wickedness,&rsquo; said
Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me again.&nbsp; You always did like
the sprite even when it was wicked, only you were too good and
right-minded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too old and too poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is old and poor now,&rsquo; said Cilla; &lsquo;worn
out and washed out into a mere rag.&nbsp; And you like her the
better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not washed out!&rsquo; he said, as her countenance
flushed into more than its wonted loveliness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I used
to wish you hadn&rsquo;t such a face when those insolent fellows
talked of you&mdash;but you will get up your looks again when I
have the care of you.&nbsp; The first college living&mdash;there
are some that can&rsquo;t choose but drop before long!&nbsp; The
worst is, I am growing no younger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but I am growing older!&rsquo; she cried,
triumphantly.&nbsp; <!-- page 489--><a name="page489"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 489</span>&lsquo;All women from twenty-five to
forty are of the same age as all men from thirty to fifty.&nbsp;
We are of just the same standing, you see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seventeen years between us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all, as you will see when I put on my cap,
and look staid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; I can&rsquo;t spare all that yellow
hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yellow indeed! if you don&rsquo;t know better what to
call it, the sooner it is out of sight the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what do you call it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Flaxen, to be sure&mdash;<i>blonde cendr&eacute;e</i>,
if you like it better&mdash;that is the colour of tow and
ashes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was like a playful kitten for the next quarter of a mile,
her prettiest sauciness returning in the exuberant, confiding
gladness with which she clung to the affection that at length
satisfied her spirit; but gravity came back to her as they
entered the village.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Wrapworth!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you will soon
pass to strangers!&nbsp; It is strange to know that, yet to feel
the old days returning for which I have pined ever since we were
carried away from home and Mr. Pendy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, nothing is wanting but that we could remain
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind!&nbsp; We will make a better Wrapworth for
one another, free from the stains of my Castle Blanch errors and
sorrows!&nbsp; I am even glad of the delay.&nbsp; I want a little
time to be good with poor dear Honor, now that I have heart and
spirit to be good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I grudge every week to her!&nbsp; I declare, Cilla,
you make me wish evil to my neighbour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then follow my example, and be content with this
present gladness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! ha! I wonder what they&rsquo;ll say at
Southminster.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I row them for using you so
abominably?&nbsp; I have not been near them since!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More shame for you!&nbsp; Sarah is my best
correspondent, and no one ever did me so much good as Mrs.
Prendergast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask her to do you good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to have done so then; for I should not be the
happy woman I am now if she had not done me good because she
could not help it!&nbsp; I hope they won&rsquo;t take it to
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope they will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Turning you out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I meant your throwing yourself away on a
broken-down governess!&nbsp; There&mdash;let us have done with
nonsense.&nbsp; Come in this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was through the churchyard, past the three graves, which
were as trim as if Lucilla had daily tended them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she said; then gazed in silence, till
with a sigh she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 490--><a name="page490"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
490</span>&lsquo;Poor Edna!&nbsp; Monument of my faults!&nbsp;
What perverse determination of mine it was that laid her
here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was your generous feeling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not miscall and embellish my perverse tyranny, as
much to defy the Charterises as to do her justice.&nbsp; I am
more ashamed now that I have the secret of your yielding!&rsquo;
she added, with downcast eyes, yet a sudden smile at the end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will take that child home and bring him up,&rsquo;
said Mr. Prendergast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If his father wishes it, it will be right; not as if it
were the pleasantest of charges.&nbsp; Thank you,&rsquo; said
Cilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Three o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp; Poor Honor, she
must be starving!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What about her?&rsquo; stammered Mr. Prendergast,
hanging back shyly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Must she be told?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; said Lucilla, with all her alert
readiness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will tell her to-night.&nbsp; You will
come in the first day you can!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow!&nbsp; Every possible day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor had truly been uneasy, fearing that Lucilla was walking,
sitting down, or fasting imprudently; but the brilliant colour,
the joyous eyes, and lively manner spoke wonderfully for the
effects of native air.&nbsp; Mr. Prendergast had become more
absent and awkward than ever, but his extra shyness passed
unremarked, and Lucilla&rsquo;s tact and grace supplied all
deficiencies without obtrusiveness.&nbsp; Always at home in the
vicarage, she made none of her former bantering display of
familiarity, but only employed it quietly to secure the guests
having what they wanted, and to awaken the host to his duties,
when he forgot that any one save herself needed attention.</p>
<p>She was carried off before the river fog should arise, and her
abstracted silence all the way home was not wondered at; although
Ph&oelig;be, sitting opposite to her, was at a loss to read the
furtive smiles that sometimes unclosed her lips, or the calm,
pensive look of perfect satisfaction on her features; and Honor
could not comprehend her entire absence of fatigue after so
trying a day, and wondered whether it were really the old
complaint&mdash;want of feeling.</p>
<p>At night, Honor came to her room, and began&mdash;&lsquo;My
dear, I want to make a little explanation to you, if you are not
tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! no&mdash;I had a little explanation to make to
you,&rsquo; she answered, with a flush and a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it may be on the same subject,&rsquo; and as
Cilla half laughed, and shook her head, she added&mdash;&lsquo;I
meant to tell you that long ago&mdash;from the time I had the
Holt&mdash;I resolved that what remained of my income after the
duties of my property were fulfilled, should make a fund for you
and Owen.&nbsp; It is not much, but I think you would like to
have the option of anticipating a part, in case it should be
possible to rescue that picture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear Honor,&rsquo; exclaimed Cilla; &lsquo;how
very kindly you <!-- page 491--><a name="page491"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 491</span>are doing it!&nbsp; Little did I
think that Charles&rsquo;s heartlessness would have brought me so
much joy and kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you would like it to be done,&rsquo; said Honor,
delighted to find that she had been able so to administer a
benefit as to excite neither offence nor resignation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We will take care that the purchaser learns the
circumstances, and he can hardly help letting you have it at a
fair valuation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, thanks, dear Honor,&rsquo; repeated Lucy;
&lsquo;and now for <i>my</i> explanation.&nbsp; Mr. Prendergast
has asked me to marry him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Had it been herself, Honor could not have been more
astounded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My child! impossible!&nbsp; Why, he might be your
father!&nbsp; Is it that you want a home, Lucy?&nbsp; Can you not
stay with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can and I will for the present, Sweetest
Honey,&rsquo; said Cilly, caressingly drawing her arm round
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to have been good and happy with you;
but indeed, indeed I can&rsquo;t help his being more to
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a very excellent man,&rsquo; began bewildered
Honor; &lsquo;but I cannot understand&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His oddity?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the very thing which
makes him my own, and nobody else&rsquo;s, Mr. Pendy!&nbsp;
Listen, Honor.&nbsp; Sit down, you don&rsquo;t half know him, nor
did I know my own heart till now.&nbsp; He came to us, you know,
when my father&rsquo;s health began to break after my
mother&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He was quite young, only a deacon; he
lived in our house, and he was, with all his dear clumsiness, a
daughter to my father, a nurse to us.&nbsp; I could tell you of
such beautiful awkward tendernesses!&nbsp; How he used to help me
with my sums&mdash;and tie Owen&rsquo;s shoes, and mince his
dinner for him&mdash;and spare my father all that was
possible!&nbsp; I am sure you know how we grieved after
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now I know that it was <i>he</i> that I cared for
at Wrapworth.&nbsp; With him I never was wild and naughty as I
was with others, though I did not know&mdash;oh! Honor, if I had
but known&mdash;that he always cared for the horrid little thing
I was, I could not have gone on so; but he was too good and wise,
even while he <i>did</i> love me, to think of <i>this</i>, till I
had been tamed and come back to you!&nbsp; I am sure I
can&rsquo;t be so naughty now, since he has thought of
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy, dearest, I am glad to see you so happy, but it is
very strange to me.&nbsp; It is such a sudden change,&rsquo; said
Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No change!&nbsp; I never cared for any one half as
much!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy!&rsquo; confounded at her apparent oblivion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; said Lucy, sitting down by
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I thought I did, but if the other had
ever been as much to me, I could never have used him as I
did!&nbsp; Oh, Honor, when a person is made of the stuff I am, it
is very hard to tell which is one&rsquo;s heart, and which is
one&rsquo;s flirting-machine! for the other thing does simulate
all the motions, and feel real true pain!&nbsp; But I know now
that Mr. Pendy was safe in my rear heart of hearts <!-- page
492--><a name="page492"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
492</span>all the time, though I never guessed it, and thought he
was only a sort of father; but you see that was why I was always
in awe of getting under Robert&rsquo;s dominion, and why I
survived his turning me off, and didn&rsquo;t at all wish him to
bring it on again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that you did not,&rsquo; said Honor, in a cheered
voice, as if acquitting her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I am sure if Mr. Prendergast only looked like using
me after my deserts, as <i>he</i> did, it would not be only a
demi-decline that I should get into,&rsquo; said Lucilla, her
eyes full of tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! Honor, think of his care of
my father!&nbsp; Kiss me and wish me joy in my father&rsquo;s
name, and like him; for when you know him, you will see he is the
only person in the wide world to whom you could safely trust your
little torment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor could not but be carried along to give the hearty kiss
and motherly congratulation as they were sought, and she saw that
she must believe what Lucy said of her own feelings,
incomprehensible though they were.&nbsp; But she regretted to
hear of the waiting for a college living, and at the first
impulse wished she had heard of this attachment before
Hiltonbury&rsquo;s fate had been fixed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Honor, as if you ought not to respect
Hiltonbury too much to tack it to my petticoat!&nbsp; But at
least thank you, for if you could once think of committing
Hiltonbury to him, you must like it for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must like what is so evidently well for you, my
child!&nbsp; Will you tell Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not till we go home, I think,&rsquo; said Cilla, with a
blush; and, as if to avoid farther discussion, she bade Honora
good night.&nbsp; Decidedly, she wished Robert to feel more than
she would like to see, or should he betray no feeling, she had
rather not be aware of it.</p>
<p>But such news was already in town as to put to flight, for a
time at least, the last remnants of coquetry.</p>
<p>Robert was in the house early in the morning, and called Miss
Charlecote to speak to him in the study.&nbsp; He had a packet of
letters in his hand, of which he gave one to herself, a long one
in Owen&rsquo;s writing, but unfinished and undirected.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Lakeville,
Newcastle District, August 14th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Honor</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no saying how much I rejoice that I can write
to you and Lucy again under the same roof.&nbsp; I hope soon to
see you together again, and revive old times, but we are delayed
by the discovery that the swamp lying full in the Grand Ottawa
and Superior Line is impracticable, and would not only be the
death of all the navvies employed thereon, but would swallow
bodily the funds of the G. O. and S. Company.&nbsp; So we are
carrying our survey in other directions, before making out our
report, after which I hope to be permanently engaged on the
construction.&nbsp; This will give me three months to spend at
<!-- page 493--><a name="page493"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
493</span>home, in knitting up old links, and considering how to
dispose of my poor little encumbrance till I can set him to make
his way here.&nbsp; You or Lucy would perhaps look out for some
lady who takes Indian children, or the like.&nbsp; I am my own
man now, and can provide the wherewithal, for my personal
expenses are small, and engineering is well paid.&nbsp; Lucy must
not think of bringing him out, for even at her fastest the Far
West would be no place for her.&nbsp; Let her think of
Glendalough, and realize that if she were here she would look
back on it as a temple of comfort, civilization, and civility,
and this place is the last attempt at social habitation for 200
and odd miles.&nbsp; It stands on a lake of its own, with an
Indian name, &ldquo;which no man can speak and no man can
spell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is colonial to the highest degree, and
inhabited by all denominations, chiefly agreed in worshipping us
as priests of the G. O. and S. Line, which is to make their
fortune; and for their manners, least said soonest mended, though
there are some happy exceptions, French Canadian, Lowland Scots,
etc. and a wiry hard-working parson, whose parish extends nearly
to Lake Superior, and whose remaining aroma of University is
refreshing.&nbsp; There is also a very nice young lad, whose tale
may be a moving example of what it is to come out here expecting
to find in the backwoods Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s life and that of
the Last of the Mohicans combined.&nbsp; That is, it was not he,
but his father, Major Randolf, an English officer, who, knowing
nothing of farming, less of Canada, and least of all of
speculation, got a grant of land, where he speculated only to
lose, and got transferred to this forlorn tract, only to shiver
with ague and die of swamp fever.&nbsp; During the twenty-five
years of this long agony, he had contrived to have two wives, the
first of whom left this son, whom he educated as a scholar,
intending to finish him in England when the tide should turn, but
whereas it never did, he must needs get a fresh partner into the
whirlpool, a Yankee damsel out of a boarding-house.&nbsp; By the
time she had had a couple of children, he died, and the whole
weight remains bound about young Randolf&rsquo;s neck, tying him
down to work for dear life in this doleful spot, without a
farthing of capital, no stock, no anything.&nbsp; I came upon the
clearing one day in the course of my surveying, and never did I
see <i>Gone to the Dogs</i> more clearly written on any spot; the
half-burnt or overthrown trees lying about overgrown with wild
vines and raspberries, the snake fence broken down, the log-house
looking as if a touch would upset it, and nothing hopeful but a
couple of patches of maize and potatoes, and a great pumpkin
climbing up a stump.&nbsp; My horse and myself were done up, so I
halted, and was amazed at the greeting I received from the youth,
who was hard at work on his hay, single-handed, except for the
two children tumbling in it.&nbsp; The lady in her rocking-chair
was contrast enough to make me heartily glad to find that she was
his stepmother, not his wife.&nbsp; Since that, I have seen a
good deal of him; he comes <!-- page 494--><a
name="page494"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 494</span>to
Lakeville, five miles across the bush and seven across the lake,
to church on Sunday, and spends the day with the parson, and Mr.
Currie has given him work in our press of business, and finds him
so effective, that he wants to take him on for good; but this
can&rsquo;t be while he has got these three stones about his
neck, for whom he works harder and lives worse than any
day-labourer at Hiltonbury; regular hand to mouth, no chance of
making a start, unless the Company will fortunately decide on the
line I am drawing through the heart of his house, which will
force them to buy him out of it.&nbsp; I go out to-morrow to mark
the said line for Mr. Currie to report upon, and will finish my
letter to travel with said report.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Aug.</i> 21<i>st.</i>&mdash;Thanks to the Fire-King,
he has done for the ancient log-house, though next time he mounts
his &ldquo;hot-copper filly,&rdquo; I do not desire a second
neck-and-neck race with him.&nbsp; A sprain of the leg, and
contusion (or confusion) of the head, are the extent of the
damage received, and you will say that it is cheap, considering
all things.&nbsp; I had done my 203 miles of marking, and was
coming back on my last day&rsquo;s journey, debating whether to
push on to Lakeville that night, camp out, or get a shake-down at
Randolf&rsquo;s, bringing my own provender, for they live on
hominy and milk, except for what he can shoot or catch.&nbsp; It
was so dark that I had nearly fixed on sleeping in the bush, when
it struck me that there must be an uncommonly fine aurora, but
getting up a little rising ground where the trees were thinner, I
observed it was to the south-west, not the north.&nbsp; That way
there lies prairie land, at this season one ocean of dry bents,
fit to burn like tinder, so that one spark would set fifty square
miles alight at once.&nbsp; All the sky in that quarter was the
colour of glowing copper, but the distance was so enormous that
danger never occurred to me till I saw the deer scampering
headlong, the birds awake and flying, and my horse trembling and
wild to be off.&nbsp; Then I remembered that the wind was full
from that direction, and not a bit of water between, nor all the
way to the Lakeville lake.&nbsp; I never knew my beast&rsquo;s
pace on the Kingston road what it was through that track, all the
rustling and scuttling of the beasts and birds sounding round us,
the glare gaining on us, and the scent of smoke beginning to
taint the wind.&nbsp; There was Randolf&rsquo;s clearing at last,
lonesome and still as ever, and a light in the window.&nbsp;
Never was it so hard to pull in a horse; however, I did so.&nbsp;
He was still up, reading by a pine torch, and in five minutes
more the woman and her children were upon the horse, making for
the lake.&nbsp; Randolf took his axe, and pocketed a book or two,
and we dashed off together for a long arm of swamp that he knew
of, running out from the lake.&nbsp; When we got to the other end
of the clearing, I thought it was all up with us.&nbsp; The wall
of red roaring flame had reached the other side, and the flame
was leaping from the top of one pine to another, making them one
shape of quivering red, like Christmas <!-- page 495--><a
name="page495"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 495</span>evergreens
in the fire, a huge tree perhaps standing up all black against
the lurid light, another crashing down like thunder, the ribbon
of flame darting up like a demon, the whole at once standing
forth a sheet of blazing light.&nbsp; I verily believe I should
have stood on, fascinated with the horror and majesty of the
sight, and feeling it vain to try to escape, when the burning
wings were spreading to enclose the clearing and us with it, but
Randolf urged me on, and we plunged through the bush at the best
speed we could make, the smoke rolling after us, and the heat
glowing like a furnace, so as to consume all power out of
us.&nbsp; It was hell itself pursuing after us, and roaring for
his prey, the trees coming crashing down, and shaking the earth
under our feet, the flame absolutely running on before us upon
the dry grass and scrub, and the scorching withering every drop
of moisture from us, though not ten minutes before, we had been
streaming at every pore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw green reeds before us, heard Randolf cry out,
&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; and thought I was plunging after him,
when I found myself on the ground, and the branches of a hemlock
covering me.&nbsp; Happily they were but the lesser boughs, and
not yet alight; and at his own desperate peril, Randolf came back
with his axe, and cut them off, then dragged me after him into
the mud.&nbsp; Never bath more welcome!&nbsp; We had to dispute
it with buffaloes, deer, all the beasts of the wood, tame and
cowed with terror, and through them we floundered on, the cold of
the water to our bodies making the burning atmosphere the more
intolerable round our heads.&nbsp; At last we came to an island,
where we fell upon the reeds so much spent that it was long
before we found that our refuge was shared by a bear and by
Randolf&rsquo;s old cow, to the infinite amaze of the
bull-frogs.&nbsp; The Fire King was a hundred yards off; and a
fierce shower, brought from other parts by his unwarrantable
doings, began to descend, and finally quenched him in such smoke
that we had to lie on our faces to avoid stifling.&nbsp; When the
sun arose, there was Lakeville in its woods on one side, on the
other the blackest desolation conceivable.&nbsp; The population
were all astir.&nbsp; Mrs. Randolf had arrived safely, and Mr.
Currie was about to set forth in search of my roasted remains,
when they perceived the signals of distress that we were making,
after Randolf had done gallant battle with the bear in defence of
the old cow.&nbsp; He is a first-rate hunter, and despatched the
fellow with such little aid as I could give, with a leg not fit
to stand upon; and when the canoes came off to fetch us, he would
not leave the place till he had skinned the beast.&nbsp; My leg
is unserviceable at present, and all my bones feel the effect of
the night in the swamp, so I am to lay by, make the drawings, and
draw up the report, while Mr. Currie and Randolf do my work over
again, all my marks having been effaced by his majesty the Fire
King, and the clearing done to our hand.&nbsp; If I could only
get rid of the intolerable parching and thirst, and the burning
of my <!-- page 496--><a name="page496"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 496</span>brains!&nbsp; I should not wonder if
I were in for a touch of swamp fever.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Owen&rsquo;s letter broke off; and Honor begged in alarm
for what Robert evidently had in reserve.&nbsp; He had received
this letter to her enclosed in one from Mr. Currie, desiring him
to inform poor young Sandbrook&rsquo;s friends of his
state.&nbsp; By his account, Owen&rsquo;s delay and surrender of
his horse had been an act of gallant self-devotion, placing him
in frightfully imminent danger, whence only the cool readiness of
young Randolf had brought him off, apparently with but slight
hurts from the fall of the tree, and exposure to the night air of
the heated swamp.&nbsp; He had been left at Lakeville in full
confidence of restoration after a week&rsquo;s rest, but on
returning from Lake Superior, Mr. Currie found him insensible,
under what was at first taken for an aggravated access of the
local fever, until, as consciousness returned, it became evident
that the limbs on the left side were powerless.&nbsp; Between a
litter and water transport, the sufferer was conveyed to
Montreal, where the evil was traced to concussion of the brain
from the blow from the tree, the more dangerous because unfelt at
first, and increased by application to business.&nbsp; The injury
of the head had deprived the limbs of motion and sensation, and
the medical men thought the case hopeless, though likely to
linger through many stages of feebleness of mind and body.&nbsp;
Under these circumstances, Mr. Currie, being obliged to return
home himself, and unable to leave the poor young man in such a
condition among strangers, had decided on bringing him to
England, according to his own most eager desire, as the doctors
declared that the voyage could do no harm, and might be
beneficial.&nbsp; Mr. Currie wrote from Quebec, where he had
taken his passage by a steamer that would follow his letter in
four days&rsquo; time, and he begged Robert to write to him at
Liverpool stating what should be done with the patient, should he
be then alive.&nbsp; His mind, he said, was clear, but weak, and
his memory, from the moment of his fall till nearly the present
time, a blank.&nbsp; He had begged Mr. Currie to write to his
sister or to Miss Charlecote, but the engineer had preferred to
devolve the communication upon Mr. Fulmort.&nbsp; Of poor Owen he
spoke with much feeling, in high terms of commendation, saying
that he was a valuable friend and companion as well as a very
right hand in his business, and that his friends might be assured
that he (Mr. Currie) would watch over him as if he were his own
son, and that his temporary assistant, Mr. Randolf, was devoted
to him, and had nursed him most tenderly from the first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four days&rsquo; time,&rsquo; said Honor, when she had
taken in the sense of these appalling tidings.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
can be at Liverpool to meet him.&nbsp; Do not object,
Robert.&nbsp; Nothing else will be bearable to either his sister
or me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was of his sister that I was thinking,&rsquo; said
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think her strong enough for the risks
of a hurried journey, <!-- page 497--><a name="page497"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 497</span>with perhaps a worse shock awaiting
her when the steamer comes in?&nbsp; Will you let me go
alone?&nbsp; I have sent orders to be telegraphed for as soon as
the <i>Asia</i> is signalled, and if I go at once, I can either
send for you if needful, or bring him to you.&nbsp; Will you not
let me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with persuasive authority, and Honora half
yielded.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be better,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;it <i>may</i>.&nbsp; A man may do more for him there than
we could, but I do not know whether poor Lucy will let you,
or&mdash;&rsquo; (as a sudden recollection recurred to her)
&lsquo;whether she ought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Owen is my friend, my charge,&rsquo; said
Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you are right, you kind Robin,&rsquo; said
Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;The journey might be a great danger for Lucy,
and if I went, I know she would not stay behind.&nbsp; But I
still think she will insist on seeing him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe not,&rsquo; said Robert; &lsquo;at least, if
she regard submission as a duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Robin, you do not know.&nbsp; Poor child, how am I
to tell her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you like for me to do so?&rsquo; said Robert, in
the quiet matter-of-course way of one to whom painful offices had
become well-nigh natural.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You?&nbsp; O Robin, if you&mdash;&rsquo; she said, in
some confusion, but at the moment the sound of the
visitor&rsquo;s bell startled her, and she was about to take
measures for their exclusion, when looking from the window, she
saw that the curate of Wrapworth had already been admitted into
the court.&nbsp; The next moment she had met him in the hall, and
seizing his hand, exclaimed in a hurried whisper, &lsquo;I
know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; But there is a terrible stroke hanging
over my poor child.&nbsp; Come in and help us to tell
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She drew him into the study, and shut the door.&nbsp; The poor
man&rsquo;s sallowness had become almost livid, and in
half-sobbing words he exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Is it so?&nbsp; Then
give her to me at once.&nbsp; I will nurse her to the last, or
save her!&nbsp; I knew it was only her being driven out to that
miserable governess life that has been destroying her!&rsquo; and
he quite glared upon poor innocent Honor as a murderess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Prendergast, I do not know what you mean.&nbsp;
Lucilla is nearly well again.&nbsp; It is only that we fear to
give her some bad news of her brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her brother!&nbsp; Is that all?&rsquo; said the curate,
in a tone of absolute satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg your
pardon, Miss Charlecote; I thought I saw a doctor here, and you
were going to sentence my darling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do see Robert Fulmort, whom I thought you
knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I do,&rsquo; said Mr. Prendergast, holding out his
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg your pardon for having made such a fool
of myself; but you see, since I came to an understanding with
that dear child, I have not thought of anything else, nor known
what I was about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert could not but look inquiringly at Miss Charlecote.</p>
<p><!-- page 498--><a name="page498"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
498</span>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she faltered, &lsquo;Mr. Prendergast
has told you&mdash;what I could not&mdash;what I had not leave to
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; put in Mr. Prendergast, in his overflowing
felicity, &lsquo;I see you think it a shocking match for such a
little gem of beauty as that; but you young men should have been
sharper.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes;&rsquo; and
he laughed awkwardly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am heartily glad,&rsquo; said Robert&mdash;and voice,
look, and grasp of the hand conveyed the fullest
earnestness&mdash;&lsquo;I am exceedingly rejoiced that the dear
little friend of all my life should be in such keeping!&nbsp; I
congratulate you most sincerely, Mr. Prendergast.&nbsp; I never
saw any one so well able to appreciate her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is over, thought Honor; how well he has stood it!&nbsp;
And now she ventured to recall them to the subject in hand, which
might well hang more heavily on her heart than the sister&rsquo;s
fate!&nbsp; It was agreed that Lucilla would bear the
intelligence best from Mr. Prendergast, and that he could most
easily restrain her desire for going to Liverpool.&nbsp; He
offered himself to go to meet Owen, but Honor could not quite
forgive the &lsquo;<i>Is that all</i>?&rsquo; and Robert remained
constant to his former view, that he, as friend both of Owen and
Mr. Currie, would be the most effective.&nbsp; So therefore it
stood, and Lucilla was called out of the drawing-room to Mr.
Prendergast, as Honor and Robert entered it.&nbsp; It was almost
in one burst that Ph&oelig;be learnt the brother&rsquo;s accident
and the sister&rsquo;s engagement, and it took her several
moments to disentangle two such extraordinary events.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad,&rsquo; repeated Robert, as he felt
rather than saw that both ladies were regarding him with
concealed anxiety; &lsquo;it is by far the happiest and safest
thing for her!&nbsp; It is an infinite relief to my
mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t but be glad,&rsquo; said Honor;
&lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t know how to forgive her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I can do very easily,&rsquo; said Robert, with a
smile on his thin lips that was very reassuring, &lsquo;not only
as a Christian, but as I believe nothing ever did me so much
good.&nbsp; My fancy for her was an incentive which drew me on to
get under better influences, and when we threw each other
overboard, I could do without it.&nbsp; She has been my best
friend, not even excepting you, Miss Charlecote; and as such I
hope always to be allowed to regard her.&nbsp; There,
Ph&oelig;be, you have had an exposition of my sentiments once for
all, and I hope I may henceforth receive credit for
sincerity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote felt that, under the name of Ph&oelig;be, this
last reproof was chiefly addressed to her; and perhaps
Ph&oelig;be understood the same, for there was the slightest of
all arch smiles about her full lip and downcast eye; and though
she said nothing, her complete faith in her brother&rsquo;s
explanation, and her Christian forgiveness of Lucilla, did not
quench a strong reserve of wondering indignation at the mixed
preferences that had thus strangely settled down upon the old
curate.</p>
<p><!-- page 499--><a name="page499"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
499</span>She followed her brother from the room, to ask whether
she had better not leave Woolstone-lane in the present
juncture.&nbsp; But there was nowhere for her to go; Beauchamp
was shut up, the cottage being painted, Sutton barely held the
three present guests, and her elder sister from home.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You cannot go without making a disturbance,&rsquo; said
Robert; &lsquo;besides, I think you ought to stay with Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; Lucilla is of no use to her; and this unlucky
Owen is more to her than all the world besides.&nbsp; You may
comfort her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had no more to urge.&nbsp; She could not tell her
brother that looks and words of Owen Sandbrook, and in especial
his last farewell, which she was at that time too young and
simple to understand, had, with her greater experience, risen
upon her in an aspect that made her desirous of avoiding
him.&nbsp; But, besides the awkwardness of such recollections at
all, they seemed cruel and selfish when the poor young man was
coming home crippled and shattered, only to die, so she dismissed
them entirely, and set herself to listen and sympathize.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>
<blockquote><p>Old isle and glorious, I have heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fame across the sea,<br />
And know my fathers&rsquo; homes are thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My fathers rest with thee.&mdash;<i>A Cleveland
Lore</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;R. M. Fulmort to Miss Charlecote.&mdash;The carriage to
meet the 6 P.M. train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was all the intelligence that reached Woolstone-lane till
the court-gates were opened, and Robert hurried in before the
carriage.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much better,&rsquo; he said &lsquo;only he
is sadly knocked up by the journey.&nbsp; Do not show yourselves
till he is in his room.&nbsp; Which is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora and Lucilla hastened to point it out, then drew back,
and waited, Honor supporting herself against the wall, pale and
breathless, Lucy hanging over the balusters, fevered with
suspense.&nbsp; She heard the tread, the quick, muttered question
and answer; she saw the heavy, helpless weight carried in; and as
the steps came upwards, she was pulled back into the sitting-room
by Honor, at first almost by force, then with passive, dejected
submission, and held tight to the back of a chair, her lip
between her teeth, as though withholding herself by force from
springing forward as the familiar voice, weak, weary, and
uncertain, met her ear.</p>
<p>At length Robert beckoned; and she flew at first, then
slackened her pace, awestruck.&nbsp; Her brother lay on the bed,
with closed eyes.&nbsp; The form was larger, more manly and
robust than what she had known, the powerful framework rendering
the wreck more piteous, and the handsome dark beard and
moustache, and crisp, thick curls of hair made the straight, <!--
page 500--><a name="page500"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
500</span>well-cut features resemble an old picture of a
cavalier; nor had the bright, sunburnt complexion lost the hue of
health; so that the whole gave the idea of present suffering
rather than abiding illness.&nbsp; He seemed to her like a
stranger, till at her step he looked up, and his dark gray eyes
were all himself as he held out his hand and fondly spoke her
name.&nbsp; She hung over him, restraining her exclamations with
strong force; and even in the midst of her embrace he was saying,
&lsquo;Honor!&nbsp; Is Honor here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trembling with emotion, Honor bent to kiss his brow, and felt
his arm thrown about her neck, and the hairy lips kissing either
cheek just as when, smooth and babyish, they had sought her
motherly caress.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I come home?&rsquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;They brought me without your
leave!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you could not feel sure of your Sweet Honey&rsquo;s
welcome?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He smiled his old smile of fondness, but dimmed by pain and
languor; and the heavy lids sank over his eyes, but to be at once
raised.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lucy!&nbsp; Home, Honor!&nbsp; It is all I
wanted,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you will be good to me, such as I
am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will sit close to you, my dear; only you cannot
talk&mdash;you must rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; My head is very bad&mdash;my eyes
ache,&rsquo; he said, turning his head from the light, with
closed eyes, and hand over them; but then he
added&mdash;&lsquo;One thing first&mdash;where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your little boy?&rsquo; said Lucilla.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
you wish to see him?&nbsp; I will call him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, I could not;&rsquo; and his brow contracted
with pain.&nbsp; &lsquo;No! but did not I tell you all about
him&mdash;your cousin, Honor?&nbsp; Do pull the curtain round,
the light hurts me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Convinced that his mind was astray, there was no attempt at
answering him; and all were so entirely occupied with his
comforts, that Ph&oelig;be saw and heard no one until Robert came
down, telling her that Owen had, in fact, improved much on the
voyage, but that the long day&rsquo;s journey by train had
brought on such severe and exhausting pain in the head, that he
could scarcely speak or look up, and fatigue seemed to have
confused the faculties that in the morning had been quite
clear.&nbsp; Robert was obliged to go to his seven o&rsquo;clock
service, and Ph&oelig;be would fain have come with him, but he
thought she might be useful at home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote is so much absorbed in Owen,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;that I do not think she heard a word about that
young Randolf.&nbsp; Mr. Currie is gone to spend to-morrow and
Sunday with his father at Birmingham, but he let me have this
young man to help to bring Owen home.&nbsp; Make Miss Charlecote
understand that he is to sleep at my place.&nbsp; I will come
back for him, and he is not to be in her way.&nbsp; He is such a
nice fellow!&nbsp; And, Ph&oelig;be, I have no time, but there is
Mrs. Murrell with the child in the study.&nbsp; Can you make her
understand that Owen is far too ill to see them to-night?&nbsp;
Keep them off poor Lucy, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 501--><a name="page501"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
501</span>&lsquo;Lucy, that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo; thought
Ph&oelig;be, as she moved to obey.&nbsp; &lsquo;In spite of all
he says, Lucy will always be his first thought next to St.
Matthew&rsquo;s; nor do I know why I should mind it, considering
what a vast space there is between!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now my pa is come, shan&rsquo;t I be a gentleman, and
ride in a carriage?&rsquo; were the sounds that greeted
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s ears as she opened the door of the study, and
beheld the small, lean child dressed in all his best; not one of
the gray linen frocks that Lucilla was constantly making for him,
but in a radiant tartan, of such huge pattern that his little
tunic barely contained a sample of one of each portentous check,
made up crosswise, so as to give a most comical, harlequin effect
to his spare limbs and weird, black eyes.&nbsp; The
disappointment that Ph&oelig;be had to inflict was severe, and
unwittingly she was the messenger whom Mrs. Murrell was likely to
regard with the most suspicion and dislike.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
home along with me, Hoing, my dear,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll always find poor granny your friend, even if
your pa&rsquo;s &lsquo;art is like the nether millstone, as it
was to your poor ma, and as others may find it yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt Mr. Sandbrook will see him when he is a
little recovered after his journey,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t make a
doubt, so long as there is no one to put between them.&nbsp; I
have &lsquo;eard how the sight of an &lsquo;opeful son was as
balm to the eyes of his father; but if I could see Mr.
Fulmort&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother is gone to church.&nbsp; It was he who sent
me to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Murrell had real confidence in Robert, whose friendliness
had long been proved, and it was less impossible to persuade her
to leave the house when she learnt that it was by his wish; but
Ph&oelig;be did not wonder at the dread with which an interview
with her was universally regarded.</p>
<p>In returning from this mission, Ph&oelig;be encountered the
stranger in the lamp-light of the hall, intently examining the
balustrade of the stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the drawing-room,&rsquo; she courteously said,
seeing that he seemed not to know where to go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he said, following her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was looking at the wood.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; We have
none like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Irish bog oak, and much admired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose all English houses can scarcely be like
this?&rsquo; said he, looking round at the carved wainscot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, this house is a curiosity.&nbsp; Part was built
before 1500.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the time of the Indians?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then smiling,
&lsquo;I had forgotten.&nbsp; It is hard to realize that I am
where I have so long wished to be.&nbsp; Am I actually in a room
360 years old?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; this room is less ancient.&nbsp; Here is the date,
1605, on the panel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then this is such a house as Milton might have grown up
in.&nbsp; It looks on the Thames?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 502--><a name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
502</span>&lsquo;How could you tell that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father had a map of London that I knew by heart, and
after we came under Temple Bar, I marked the bearings of the
streets.&nbsp; Before that I was not clear.&nbsp; Perhaps there
have been changes since 1830, the date of his map.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be opened a map, and he eagerly traced his route,
pronouncing the names of the historical localities with a relish
that made her almost sorry for their present associations.&nbsp;
She liked his looks.&nbsp; He seemed to be about two or three and
twenty, tall and well-made, with somewhat of the bearing of his
soldier-father, but broad-shouldered and athletic, as though his
strength had been exercised in actual bodily labour.&nbsp; His
clear, light hazel eye was candid and well opened, with that
peculiar prompt vigilance acquired by living in a wild country,
both steady to observe and keen to keep watch.&nbsp; The dark
chestnut hair covered a rather square brow, very fair, though the
rest of the face was browned by sun and weather; the nose was
straight and sensible, the chin short and firm; the lips, though
somewhat compressed when shut, had a look of good-humour and
cheerful intelligence peculiarly pleasant to behold.&nbsp;
Altogether, it was a face that inspired trust.</p>
<p>Presently the entrance of the tea-things obliged the map to be
cleared away; and Ph&oelig;be, while measuring out the tea, said
that she supposed Miss Charlecote would soon come down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then are not you a Charlecote?&rsquo; he asked, with a
tone of disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; I am Ph&oelig;be Fulmort.&nbsp; There is
no Charlecote left but herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was my mother&rsquo;s name; and mine, Humfrey
Charlecote Randolf.&nbsp; Sandbrook thought there was some
connection between the families.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be absolutely started, hurt for a moment that a
stranger should presume to claim a name of such associations; yet
as she met the bright, honest eyes, feeling glad that it should
still be a living name, worthily borne.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is an old
family name at Hiltonbury, and one very much honoured,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is well,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is good
to have a name that calls one to live up to it!&nbsp; And what is
more strange, I am sure Miss Charlecote once had my
mother&rsquo;s hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beautiful ruddy gold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; like no one else.&nbsp; I was wanting to do
like poor Sandbrook.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked up in her face, and
stroked her hair as she was leaning over him, and said, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to miss my own curls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, half indignantly,
&lsquo;he should know when those curls were hidden away and grew
silvery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He told me those things in part,&rsquo; said the young
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has felt the return very deeply, and I think
it accounts for his being so much worse to-night&mdash;worse than
I have seen him since we were at Montreal.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 503--><a name="page503"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
503</span>&lsquo;Is he quite sensible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; I see the ladies do not think him so
to-night; but he has been himself from the first, except that
over-fatigue or extra weakness affect his memory for the time;
and he cannot read or exert his mind&mdash;scarcely be read
to.&nbsp; And he is sadly depressed in spirits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And no wonder, poor man,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I cannot think it is as they told us at
Montreal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That the brain would go on weakening, and he become
more childish.&nbsp; Now I am sure, as he has grown stronger, he
has recovered intellect and intelligence.&nbsp; No one could
doubt it who heard him three days ago advising me what branch of
mathematics to work up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall hear to-morrow what Dr. F--- says.&nbsp; Miss
Charlecote wrote to him as soon as we had my brother&rsquo;s
telegram.&nbsp; I hope you are right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For you see,&rsquo; continued the Canadian, eagerly,
&lsquo;injury from an external cause cannot be like original
organic disease.&nbsp; I hope and trust he may recover.&nbsp; He
is the best friend I ever had, except Mr. Henley, our clergyman
at Lakeville.&nbsp; You know how he saved all our lives; and he
persuaded Mr. Currie to try me, and give me a chance of providing
for my little brothers and their mother better than by our poor
old farm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are they?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is gone to her sister at Buffalo.&nbsp; The price
of the land will help them on for a little while there, and if I
can get on in engineering, I shall be able to keep them in some
comfort.&nbsp; I began to think the poor boys were doomed to have
no education at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you always live at Lakeville?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I grew up in a much more civilized part of the
world.&nbsp; We had a beautiful farm upon Lake Ontario, and
raised the best crops in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was not till
we got entangled in the Land Company, five years ago, that we
were sold up; and we have been sinking deeper ever
since&mdash;till the old cow and I had the farm all to
ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you bear it?&rsquo; asked Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! it was rather dreary to see one thing going after
another.&nbsp; But somehow, after I lost my own black mare, poor
Minnehaha, I never cared so much for any of the other
things.&nbsp; Once for all, I got ashamed of my own childish
selfishness.&nbsp; And then, you see, the worse things were, the
stronger the call for exertion.&nbsp; That was the great
help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, I can quite imagine that&mdash;I know
it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, thinking how exertion had helped her
through her winter of trial.&nbsp; &lsquo;You never were without
some one to work for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; even when my father was gone&rsquo;&mdash;and his
voice was less clear&mdash;&lsquo;there was the less time to feel
the change, when the boys and their mother had nothing but me
between them and want.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 504--><a name="page504"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
504</span>&lsquo;And you worked for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After a fashion,&rsquo; he said, smiling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Spade-husbandry alone is very poor earth-scratching; and I
don&rsquo;t really know whether, between that and my gun, we
could have got through this winter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a life!&rsquo; exclaimed Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Realities, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only what many colonists undergo,&rsquo; he
answered; &lsquo;if they do not prosper, it is a very hard life,
and the shifting hopes render it the more trying to those who are
not bred to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to those that are?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To those that are there are many compensations.&nbsp;
It is a free out-of-doors life, and the glorious sense of extent
and magnificence in our woods, the sport one has there, the
beauty of our autumns, and our white, grand, silent winters, make
it a life <i>well</i> worth living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would these have made you content to be a
backwoodsman all your life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They&mdash;and the boys&mdash;were my delight when I was
one.&nbsp; And, after all, I used to recollect it was a place
where there was a clear duty to do, and so, perhaps, safer than
what fancy or choice would point at.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are very glad not to be still condemned to
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heartily glad not to be left to try to prop up a
tumble-down log-hut with my own shoulder,&rsquo; he
laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;This journey to England has been the great
desire of my life, and I am very thankful to have had it brought
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was broken off by Robert&rsquo;s
entrance.&nbsp; Finding that it was nearly nine o&rsquo;clock, he
went up-stairs to remind Miss Charlecote that tea had long been
awaiting her, and presently brought her back from the silent
watch by Owen&rsquo;s side that had hitherto seemed to be rest
and comfort to all the three.</p>
<p>Owen had begged that his cup might be sent up by his friend,
on whom he was very dependent, and it was agreed that Mr. Randolf
should sleep in his room, and remain as a guest at Woolstone-lane
until Mr. Currie should come to town.&nbsp; Indeed, Miss
Charlecote relied on him for giving the physician an account of
the illness which Owen, at his best, could not himself describe;
and she cordially thanked him for his evidently devoted
attendance, going over every particular with him, but still so
completely absorbed in her patient as to regard him in no light
but as an appendage necessary to her boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you get on with the backwoodsman,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; asked Lucilla, when she came down to tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he is a sterling character,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, in a tone of grave, deep thought, not quite as if
answering the question, and with an observable deepening of the
red of her cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You quaint goose!&rsquo; said Lucy, with a laugh that
jarred upon Honor, who turned round at her with a look of
reproachful surprise.</p>
<p><!-- page 505--><a name="page505"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
505</span>&lsquo;Indeed, Honor dear,&rsquo; she said, in
self-vindication, &lsquo;I am not hard-hearted!&nbsp; I am only
very much relieved!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think half so badly of
poor Owen as I expected to do; and if we can keep Mrs. Murrell
from driving him distracted, I expect to see him mend
fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert confirmed her cheerful opinion, but their younger and
better prognostications fell sadly upon Honora&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp;
She had been too much grieved and shocked to look for recovery,
and all that she dared to expect was to tend her darling&rsquo;s
feebleness, her best desire was that his mind might yet have
power to embrace the hope of everlasting Life ere he should pass
away from her.&nbsp; Let this be granted, and she was prepared to
be thankful, be his decay never so painful to witness and
attend.</p>
<p>She could not let Robert leave her that night without a
trembling question whether he had learnt how it was with Owen on
this point.&nbsp; He had not failed to inquire of the engineer,
but he could tell her very little.&nbsp; Owen&rsquo;s conduct had
been unexceptionable, but he had made scarcely any demonstration
or profession, and on the few occasions when opinions were
discussed, spoke not irreverently, but in a tone of one who
regretted and respected the tenets that he no longer held.&nbsp;
Since his accident, he had been too weak and confused to dwell on
any subjects but those of the moment; but he had appeared to take
pleasure in the unobtrusive, though decided religious habits of
young Randolf.</p>
<p>There she must rest for the present, and trust to the
influence of home, perhaps to that of the shadow of death.&nbsp;
At least he was the child of many prayers, and had not Lucilla
returned to her changed beyond her hopes?&nbsp; Let it be as it
would, she could not but sleep in gratitude that both her
children were again beneath her roof.</p>
<p>She was early dressed, and wishing the backwoodsman were
anywhere but in Owen&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; However, to her joy, the
door was open, and Owen called her in, looking so handsome as he
lay partly raised by pillows, that she could hardly believe in
his condition, except for his weak, subdued voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am much better this morning.&nbsp; I have slept
off the headache, and have been enjoying the old
sounds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is your friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rushed off to look at St. Paul&rsquo;s through the
shaking of doormats, and pay his respects to the Thames.&nbsp; He
has none of the colonial <i>nil admirari</i> spirit, but looks at
England as a Greek colonist would have looked at Athens.&nbsp; I
only regret that the reality must tame his raptures.&nbsp; I told
him to come back by breakfast-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will lose his way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he!&nbsp; You little know the backwood&rsquo;s
power of topography!&nbsp; Even I could nearly rival some of the
Arab stories, and he could guide you anywhere&mdash;or after any
given beast in the Newcastle district.&nbsp; Honor, you must know
and like him.&nbsp; <!-- page 506--><a name="page506"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 506</span>He really is the New World
Charlecote whom you always held over our heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you called him Randolf?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is his surname, but his Christian name is Humfrey
Charlecote, from his grandfather.&nbsp; His mother was the lady
my father told you of.&nbsp; He saved an old Bible out of the
fire, with it all in the fly-leaf.&nbsp; He shall show it to you,
and it can be easily confirmed by writing to the places.&nbsp; I
would have gone myself, if I had not been the poor creature I
am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; said Honora, &lsquo;I dare say it
is so.&nbsp; I am very glad you found so attentive a
friend.&nbsp; I am most thankful to him for his care of
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you accept him as a relation,&rsquo; said Owen,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, oh, yes,&rsquo; said Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would you
like anything before breakfast?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen answered with a little plaintiveness.&nbsp; Perhaps he
was disappointed at this cold acquiescence; but it was not a
moment at which Honor could face the thought of a colonial
claimant of the Holt.&nbsp; With Owen helpless upon her hands,
she needed both a home and ample means to provide for him and his
sister and child; and the American heir, an unwelcome idea twenty
years previously, when only a vague possibility, was doubly
undesirable when long possession had endeared her inheritance to
her, when he proved not even to be a true Charlecote, and when
her own adopted children were in sore want of all that she could
do for them.&nbsp; The evident relinquishment of poor
Owen&rsquo;s own selfish views on the Holt made her the less
willing to admit a rival, and she was sufficiently on the borders
of age to be pained by having the question of heirship brought
forward.&nbsp; And she knew, what Owen did not, that, if this
youth&rsquo;s descent were indeed what it was said to be, he
represented the elder line, and that even Humfrey had wondered
what would be his duty in the present contingency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said she to herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is no need as yet to think of it!&nbsp; The place is
my own by every right!&nbsp; Humfrey told me so!&nbsp; I will
take time to see what this youth may be, and make sure of his
relationship.&nbsp; Then, if it be right and just, he shall come
after me.&nbsp; But I <i>will</i> not raise expectations, nor
notice him more than as Owen&rsquo;s friend and a distant
kinsman.&nbsp; It would be fatally unsettling to do
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen urged her no farther.&nbsp; Either he had not energy to
enforce any point for long together, or he felt that the
succession might be a delicate subject, for he let her lead to
his personal affairs, and he was invalid enough to find them
fully engrossing.</p>
<p>The Canadian came in punctually, full of animation and
excitement, of which Ph&oelig;be had the full benefit, till he
was called to help Owen to dress.&nbsp; While this was going on,
Robert came into the drawing-room to breathe, after the hard task
of pacifying Mrs. Murrell.</p>
<p><!-- page 507--><a name="page507"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
507</span>&lsquo;What are you going to do to-day,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you got through
your shopping?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of it.&nbsp; Do you mean that you could come out
with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; you will never get through business
otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if you have an afternoon to spare, could not we
take Mr. Randolf to the Tower?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has only to-day at liberty, and is so full of
eagerness about all the grand old historical places, that it
seems hard that he should have to find his way about alone, with
no one to sympathize with him&mdash;half the day cut up, too,
with nursing Owen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He seems to have no difficulty in finding his
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but I really should enjoy showing him the old
armour.&nbsp; He was asking me about it this morning.&nbsp; I
think he knows nearly as much of it as we do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; I say, Ph&oelig;be, would you object
to my taking Brown and Clay&mdash;my two head boys?&nbsp; I owe
them a treat, and they would just enter into this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be was perfectly willing to accept the two head boys,
and the appointment had just been made when the doctor
arrived.&nbsp; Again he brought good hope.&nbsp; From his own
examination of Owen, and from Mr. Randolf&rsquo;s report, he was
convinced that a considerable amelioration had taken place, and
saw every reason to hope that in so young and vigorous a nature
the injury to the brain might be completely repaired, and the use
of the limbs might in part, at least, return, though full
recovery could not be expected.&nbsp; He wished to observe his
patient for a month or six weeks in town, that the course of
treatment might be decided, after which he had better be taken to
the Holt, to enjoy the pure air, and be out of doors as much as
the season would permit.</p>
<p>To Honor this opinion was the cause of the deepest, most
thankful gladness; but on coming back to Owen she found him
sitting in his easy-chair, with his hand over his eyes, and his
look full of inexpressible dejection and despondency.&nbsp; He
did not, however, advert to the subject, only saying, &lsquo;Now
then! let us have in the young pauper to see the old
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Owen, you had better rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; let us do the thing.&nbsp; The grandmother,
too!&rsquo; he said impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will fetch little Owen; but you really are not fit
for Mrs. Murrell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am; what am I good for but such things?&nbsp; It
will make no difference, and it must be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My boy, you do not know to what you expose
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I,&rsquo; said Owen, sadly.</p>
<p>Lucilla, even though Mr. Prendergast had just come to share
her anxieties, caught her nephew on his way, and popped her last
newly completed pinafore over his harlequinism, persuading him
that it was most beautiful and new.</p>
<p><!-- page 508--><a name="page508"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
508</span>The interview passed off better than could have been
hoped.&nbsp; The full-grown, grave-looking man was so different
from the mere youth whom Mrs. Murrell had been used to scold and
preach at, that her own awe seconded the lectures upon quietness
that had been strenuously impressed on her; and she could not
complain of his reception of his &lsquo;&rsquo;opeful son,&rsquo;
in form at least.&nbsp; Owen held out his hand to her, and bent
to kiss his boy, signed to her to sit down, and patiently
answered her inquiries and regrets, asking a few civil questions
in his turn.</p>
<p>Then he exerted himself to say, &lsquo;I hope to do my best
for him and for you, Mrs. Murrell, but I can make no promises; I
am entirely dependent at present, and I do not know whether I may
not be so for life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whereat, and at the settled mournful look with which it was
spoken, Mrs. Murrell burst out crying, and little Owen hung on
her, almost crying too.&nbsp; Honor, who had been lying in wait
for Owen&rsquo;s protection, came hastily in and made a
clearance, Owen again reaching out his hand, which he laid on the
child&rsquo;s head, so as to turn up the face towards him for a
moment.&nbsp; Then releasing it almost immediately, he rested his
chin on his hand, and Honor heard him mutter under his moustache,
&lsquo;Flibbertigibbet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we go home, we will take little Owen with
us,&rsquo; said Honor, kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is high time he
was taken from Little Whittington-street.&nbsp; Country air will
soon make a different-looking child of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; he answered, despondingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is very good in you; but have you not troubles enough
already?</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall not be a trouble, but a pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little wretch!&nbsp; He must grow up to work, and
to know that he must work while he can;&rsquo; and Owen passed
his hand over those useless fingers of his as though the longing
to be able to work were strong on him.</p>
<p>Honor had agreed with Lucilla that father and son ought to be
together, and that little &lsquo;Hoeing&rsquo;s&rsquo; education
ought to commence.&nbsp; Cilla insisted that all care of him
should fall to her.&nbsp; She was in a vehement, passionate mood
of self-devotion, more overset by hearing that her brother would
be a cripple for life than by what appeared to her the less
melancholy doom of an early death.&nbsp; She had allowed herself
to hope so much from his improvement on the voyage, that what to
Honor was unexpected gladness was to her grievous
disappointment.&nbsp; Mr. Prendergast arrived to find her half
captious, half desperate.</p>
<p>See Owen!&nbsp; Oh, no! he must not think of it.&nbsp; Owen
had seen quite people enough to-day; besides, he would be letting
all out to him as he had done the other day.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Prendergast humbly apologized for his betrayal; but
had not Owen been told of the engagement?</p>
<p>Oh, dear, no!&nbsp; He was in no state for fresh
agitations.&nbsp; Indeed, with him, a miserable, helpless
cripple, Lucy did not <!-- page 509--><a name="page509"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 509</span>see how she could go on as
before.&nbsp; She could not desert him&mdash;oh, no!&mdash;she
must work for him and his child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Work!&nbsp; Why, Cilla, you have not strength for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite well.&nbsp; I have strength for anything now
I have some one to work for.&nbsp; Nothing hurts me but
loneliness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Folly, child!&nbsp; The same home that receives you
will receive them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; As if I could throw such a dead weight
on any one&rsquo;s hands!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not on <i>any one&rsquo;s</i>,&rsquo; said Mr.
Prendergast.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I see how it is, Cilla; you have
changed your mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Lucilla, with an outbreak of her old
impatience; &lsquo;but you men are so selfish!&nbsp; Bothering me
about proclaiming all this nonsense, just when my brother is come
home in this wretched state!&nbsp; After all, he was my brother
before anything else, and I have a right to consider him
first!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Cilla, you shall be bothered no more,&rsquo; said
Mr. Prendergast, rising.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you want me, well and
good&mdash;you know where to find your old friend; if not, and
you can&rsquo;t make up your mind to it, why, then we are as we
were in old times.&nbsp; Good-bye, my dear; I won&rsquo;t fret
you any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he to himself, as he paused in the
Court, and was busy wiping from the sleeve of his coat two broad
dashes of wet that had certainly not proceeded from the clouds,
&lsquo;the dear child&rsquo;s whole heart is with her brother now
she has got him back again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not torment her any
more.&nbsp; What a fool I was to think that anything but
loneliness could have made her accept me&mdash;poor
darling!&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go out to the Bishop of Sierra
Leone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can have happened to him?&rsquo; thought
Ph&oelig;be, as he strode past the little party on their walk to
the Tower.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can that wretched little Cilly have been
teasing him?&nbsp; I am glad Robert has escaped from her
clutches!&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, Ph&oelig;be had little leisure for such speculations
in the entertainment of witnessing her companion&rsquo;s
intelligent interest in all that he saw.&nbsp; The walk
itself&mdash;for which she had begged&mdash;was full of wonder;
and the Tower, which Robert&rsquo;s slight knowledge of one of
the officials enabled them to see in perfection, received the
fullest justice, both historically and loyally.&nbsp; The
incumbent of St. Matthew&rsquo;s was so much occupied with
explanations to his boys, that Ph&oelig;be had the stranger all
to herself, and thus entered to the full into that unfashionable
but most heart-stirring of London sights, &lsquo;the Towers of
Julius,&rsquo; from the Traitors&rsquo; Gate, where Elizabeth sat
in her lion-like desolation, to her effigy in her glory upon
Tilbury Heath&mdash;the axe that severed her mother&rsquo;s
&lsquo;slender neck&rsquo;&mdash;the pistol-crowned stick of her
father&mdash;the dark cage where her favourite Raleigh was
mewed&mdash;and the whole series of the relics of the disgraces
and the glories of England&rsquo;s royal line&mdash;well fitted,
indeed, to strike the imagination of one who had grown up in the
New World without antiquity.</p>
<p><!-- page 510--><a name="page510"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
510</span>If it were a satisfaction to be praised and thanked for
this expedition, Ph&oelig;be had it; for on her return she was
called into Owen&rsquo;s room, where his first words to her were
of thanks for her good-nature to his friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it was nothing but a pleasure,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It happened that Robert had some boys whom he
wanted to take.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somehow she did not wish Owen to
think she had done it on his own account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you liked him?&rsquo; asked Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, very much indeed,&rsquo; she heartily said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I knew you would;&rsquo; and he lay back as if
fatigued.&nbsp; Then, as Ph&oelig;be was about to leave him, he
added&mdash;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get my ladies to heed anything
but me.&nbsp; You and Robert must take pity on him, if you
please.&nbsp; Get him to Westminster Abbey, or the Temple Church,
or somewhere worth seeing to-morrow.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let them
be extortionate of his waiting on me.&nbsp; I must learn to do
without him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be promised, and went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be is grown what one calls a fine young woman
instead of a sweet girl,&rsquo; said Owen to his sister, when she
next came into the room; &lsquo;but she has managed to keep her
innocent, half-wondering look, just as she has the freshness of
her colour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, why not, when she has not had one <i>real</i>
experience?&rsquo; said Lucilla, a little bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None?&rsquo; he asked, with a marked tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None,&rsquo; she answered, and he let his hand drop
with a sigh; but as if repenting of any half betrayal of feeling,
added, &lsquo;she has had all her brothers and sisters at sixes
and sevens, has not she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you call that a real experience?&rsquo; said
Lucilla, almost with disdain, and the conversation dropped.</p>
<p>Owen&rsquo;s designs for his friend&rsquo;s Sunday fell to the
ground.&nbsp; The backwoodsman fenced off the proposals for his
pleasure, by his wish to be useful in the sick-room; and when
told of Owen&rsquo;s desire, was driven to confess that he did
not wish for fancy church-going on his first English
Sunday.&nbsp; There was enough novelty without that; the
cathedral service was too new for him to wish to hear it for the
first time when there was so much that was unsettling.</p>
<p>Honor, and even Robert, were a little disappointed.&nbsp; They
thought eagerness for musical service almost necessarily went
with church feeling; and Ph&oelig;be was the least in the world
out of favour for the confession, that though it was well that
choirs should offer the most exquisite and ornate praise, yet
that her own country-bred associations with the plain unadorned
service at Hiltonbury rendered her more at home where the prayers
were read, and the responses congregational, not choral.&nbsp; To
her it was more devotional, though she fully believed that the
other way was the best for those who had begun with it.</p>
<p>So they went as usual to the full service of the parish
church, <!-- page 511--><a name="page511"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 511</span>where the customs were scrupulously
rubrical without being ornate.&nbsp; The rest and calm of that
Sunday were a boon, coming as they did after a bustling week.</p>
<p>All the ensuing days Ph&oelig;be was going about choosing
curtains and carpets, or hiring servants for herself or
Mervyn.&nbsp; She was obliged to act alone, for Miss Charlecote,
on whom she had relied for aid, was engrossed in attending on
Owen, and endeavouring to wile away the hours that hung heavily
on one incapable of employment or even attention for more than a
few minutes together.&nbsp; So constantly were Honor and Lucy
engaged with him, that Ph&oelig;be hardly saw them morning, noon,
or night; and after being out for many hours, it generally fell
to her lot to entertain the young Canadian for the chief part of
the evening.&nbsp; Mr. Currie had arrived in town on the Monday,
and came at once to see Owen.&nbsp; His lodgings were in the
City, where he would be occupied for some time in more formally
mapping out and reporting on the various lines proposed for the
G. O. and S. line; and finding how necessary young Randolf still
was to the invalid, he willingly agreed to the proposal that
while Miss Charlecote continued in London, the young man should
continue to sleep and spend his evenings in Woolstone-lane.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>
<blockquote><p>Have you seen but a bright lily grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before rude hands have touched it?<br />
Have you marked but the fall of the snow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the soil hath smutched it?&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of a week Mervyn made his appearance in a vehement
hurry.&nbsp; Cecily&rsquo;s next sister, an officer&rsquo;s wife,
was coming home with two little children, for a farewell visit
before going to the Cape, and Maria and Bertha must make way for
her.&nbsp; So he wanted to take Ph&oelig;be home that afternoon
to get the Underwood ready for them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mervyn, how can I go?&nbsp; I am not nearly
ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can you have been doing then?&rsquo; he exclaimed,
with something of his old temper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This house has been in such a state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you were not wanted to nurse the sick man, were
you?&nbsp; I thought you were one that was to be trusted.&nbsp;
What more is there to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be looked at her list of commissions, and found
herself convicted.&nbsp; Those patterns ought to have been sent
back two days since.&nbsp; What had she been about?&nbsp;
Listening to Mr. Randolf&rsquo;s explanations of the
<i>Hiawatha</i> scenery!&nbsp; Why had she not written a note
about that hideous hearth-rug?&nbsp; Because Mr. Randolf was
looking over Stowe&rsquo;s <i>Survey of London</i>.&nbsp;
Methodical Ph&oelig;be felt herself in disgrace, and yet,
somehow, she could not be sorry enough; she wanted a reprieve
from exile at Hiltonbury, <!-- page 512--><a
name="page512"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 512</span>alone and
away from all that was going on.&nbsp; At least she should hear
whether <i>Macbeth</i>, at the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre,
fulfilled Mr. Randolf&rsquo;s conceptions of it; and if Mr.
Currie approved his grand map of the Newcastle district, with the
little trees that she had taught him to draw.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the first time that Mervyn had been justly
angry with her; but he was so much less savage than in his
injustice that she was very much ashamed and touched; and
finally, deeply grateful for the grace of this one day in which
to repair her negligence, provided she would be ready to start by
seven o&rsquo;clock next morning.&nbsp; Hard and diligently she
worked, and very late she came home.&nbsp; As she was on her way
up-stairs she met Robert coming out of Owen&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; he said, turning with her into her
room, &lsquo;what is the matter with Lucy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that you have not observed how ill she is
looking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; nothing particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, I cannot imagine what you have been
thinking about.&nbsp; I thought you would have saved her, and
helped Miss Charlecote, and you absolutely never noticed her
looks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry.&nbsp; I have been so much
engaged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Absorbed, you should call it!&nbsp; Who would have
thought you would be so heedless of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was gone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still crazy about Lucy,&rsquo; was
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s first thought; her second, &lsquo;Another
brother finding me heedless and selfish!&nbsp; What can be the
matter with me?&rsquo;&nbsp; And when she looked at Lucilla with
observant eyes, she did indeed recognize the justice of
Robert&rsquo;s anxiety and amazement.&nbsp; The brilliant
prettiness had faded away as if under a blight, the eyes were
sinking into purple hollows, the attitude was listless, the whole
air full of suffering.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be was dismayed and
conscience-stricken, and would fain have offered inquiries and
sympathy, but no one had more thoroughly than Lucy the power of
repulsion.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, nothing was amiss&mdash;of course she
felt the frost.&nbsp; She would not speak to Honor&mdash;there
was nothing to speak about;&rsquo; and she went up to her
brother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Mr. Randolf was out with Mr. Currie, and Ph&oelig;be, still
exceedingly busy writing notes and orders, and packing for her
journey, did not know that there was an unconscious resolution in
her own mind that her business <i>should</i> not be done till he
came home, were it at one o&rsquo;clock at night!&nbsp; He did
come at no unreasonable hour, and found her fastening directions
upon the pile of boxes in the hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&nbsp; Miss Charlecote is not going
away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but I am going to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I must get into our new house, and receive my
sisters there the day after to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 513--><a name="page513"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
513</span>&lsquo;I thought you lived with Miss
Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it possible that you did not know what I have been
doing all this week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you not preparing a house for your
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and another for myself.&nbsp; Did you not
understand that we set up housekeeping separately upon his
marriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not understand,&rsquo; said Humfrey Randolf,
disconsolately.&nbsp; &lsquo;You told me you owed everything to
Miss Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid your colonial education translated that
into &pound; s. d.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are not poor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not exactly,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, rather
puzzled and amused by his downcast air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;your brother is in
business; and Mr. Fulmort of St.
Matthew&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Fulmort of St. Matthew&rsquo;s is poor because he
gave all to St. Matthew&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;but our business is not a small one, and the property in
the country is large.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pasted on her last direction in disconsolate silence, then
reading, &lsquo;Miss Fulmort, The Underwood, Hiltonbury,
Elverslope Station,&rsquo; resumed with fresh animation,
&lsquo;At least you live near Miss Charlecote?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we are wedged in between her park and our
own&mdash;my brother&rsquo;s, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all right then!&nbsp; She has asked me for
Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad of it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There, thank you, good night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there nothing more that I can do for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&mdash;no, no, don&rsquo;t hammer that down, you
will wake Owen.&nbsp; Good night, good-bye; I shall be gone by
half-past six.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Ph&oelig;be said good-bye, she knew perfectly well that
the hours of the morning were as nothing to the backwoodsman, and
with spirits greatly exhilarated by the Christmas invitation, she
went to bed, much too sleepy to make out why her wealth seemed so
severe a shock to Humfrey Randolf.</p>
<p>The six o&rsquo;clock breakfast was well attended, for Miss
Charlecote was there herself, as well as the Canadian,
Ph&oelig;be, and Mervyn, who was wonderfully amiable considering
the hour in the morning.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be felt in some slight
degree less unfeeling when she found that Lucilla&rsquo;s fading
looks had been no more noticed by Miss Charlecote than by
herself; but Honor thought Owen&rsquo;s illness accounted for
all, and only promised that the doctor should inspect her.</p>
<p>A day of exceeding occupation ensued.&nbsp; Mervyn talked the
whole way of Cecily, his plans and his prospects; and Ph&oelig;be
had to draw her mind out of one world and immerse it into
another, straining ears and voice all the time to hear and be
heard through the roar of the train.&nbsp; He left her at the
cottage: and then began the work of the day, presiding over
upholsterers, hanging pictures, arranging books, settling
cabinets of collections, disposing of ornaments, snatching meals
at odd times, in <!-- page 514--><a name="page514"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 514</span>odder places, and never daring to
rest till long after dark, when, with fingers freshly purified
from dust, limbs stiff with running up and down stairs, and arms
tired with heavy weights, she sat finally down before the
drawing-room fire with her solitary cup of coffee, and a book
that she was far too weary to open.</p>
<p>Had she never been tired before, that her heart should sink in
this unaccountable way?&nbsp; Why could she not be more glad that
her sisters were coming home, and dear Miss Fennimore?&nbsp; What
made every one seem so dull and stupid, and the comings and
goings so oppressive, as if everything would be hateful till
Christmas?&nbsp; Why had she belied all her previous good
character for method and punctuality of late, and felt as if
existence only began when&mdash;one person was in the room?</p>
<p>Oh! can this be falling in love?</p>
<p>There was a chiffonier with a looking-glass back just opposite
to her, and, raising her eyes, poor Ph&oelig;be beheld a young
lady with brow, cheeks, and neck perfectly glowing with
crimson!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shan&rsquo;t stand there long at any rate,&rsquo;
said she, almost vindictively, getting up and pushing the table
with its deep cover between her and the answering witness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Love!&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; Yet I don&rsquo;t see why I
should be ashamed!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; He is my wise man, he is the
real Humfrey Charlecote!&nbsp; His is the very nature I always
thought some one must still have&mdash;the exact judgment I
longed to meet with.&nbsp; Not stern like Robin&rsquo;s, not
sharp like Mervyn&rsquo;s, nor high-flying like dear Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s, nor soft like Bevil&rsquo;s, nor light like
Lucy&rsquo;s, nor clear and clever like Miss
Fennimore&rsquo;s&mdash;no, but considerate and solid, tender and
true&mdash;such as one can lean upon!&nbsp; I know why he has the
steadfast eyes that I liked so much the first evening.&nbsp; And
there is so much more in him than I can measure or
understand.&nbsp; Yes, though I have known him but ten days, I
have seen much more of him than of most men in a year.&nbsp; And
he has been so much tried, and has had such a life, that he may
well be called a real hero in a quiet way.&nbsp; Yes, I well may
like him!&nbsp; And I am sure he likes me!&rsquo; said another
whisper of the heart, which, veiled as was the lady in the
mirror, made Ph&oelig;be put both hands over her face, in a
shamefaced ecstatic consciousness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay&mdash;I was
the first lady he had seen, the only person to speak to.&nbsp;
No, no; I know it was not that&mdash;I feel it was not!&nbsp;
Why, otherwise, did he seem so sorry I was not poor?&nbsp; Oh!
how nice it would be if I were!&nbsp; We could work for each
other in his glorious new land of hope!&nbsp; I, who love work,
was made for work!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care for this mere young
lady life!&nbsp; And must my trumpery thousand a year stand in
the way?&nbsp; As to birth, I suppose he is as well or better
born than I&mdash;and, oh! so far superior in tone and breeding
to what ours used to be!&nbsp; He ought to know better than to
think me a fine young lady, and himself only an engineer&rsquo;s
assistant!&nbsp; But he won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Of course he will be
honourable about it&mdash;and&mdash;and perhaps never dare to say
another word till he has made <!-- page 515--><a
name="page515"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 515</span>his
fortune&mdash;and when will that ever be?&nbsp; It will be
right&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But&rsquo; (and a very different
but it was this time) &lsquo;what am I thinking about?&nbsp; How
can I be wishing such things when I have promised to devote
myself to Maria?&nbsp; If I could rough it gladly, she could not;
and what a shameful thing it is of me to have run into all this
long day dream and leave her out.&nbsp; No, I know my lot!&nbsp;
I am to live on here, and take care of Maria, and grow to be an
old maid!&nbsp; I shall hear about him, when he comes to be a
great man, and know that the Humfrey Charlecote I dreamt about is
still alive!&nbsp; There, I won&rsquo;t have any more
nonsense!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she opened her book; but finding that Humfrey
Randolf&rsquo;s remarks would come between her and the sense, she
decided that she was too tired to read, and put herself to
bed.&nbsp; But there the sense of wrong towards Maria filled her
with remorse that she had accepted her rights of seniority, and
let the maids place her in the prettiest room, with the best bay
window, and most snug fireplace; nor could she rest till she had
pacified her self-reproach, by deciding that all her own goods
should move next day into the chamber that did not look at the
Holt firs, but only at the wall of the back yard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, stoutly in her honest
dealing with herself in her fresh, untried morning senses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I do love Humfrey Charlecote Randolf, and I think he loves
me!&nbsp; Whether anything more may come of it, will be ordered
for me; but whether it do so or not, it is a blessing to have
known one like him, and now that I am warned, and can try to get
back self-control, I will begin to be the better for it.&nbsp;
Even if I am not quite so happy, this is something more beautiful
than I ever knew before.&nbsp; I will be content!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when Bertha and Maria arrived, brimful of importance at
having come home with no escort but a man and maid, and voluble
with histories of Sutton, and wedding schemes, they did not find
an absent nor inattentive listener.&nbsp; Yet the keen Bertha
made the remark, &lsquo;Something has come over you,
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; You have more countenance than ever you had
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s colour rushed into her cheeks, but
she demanded the meaning of countenance, and embarked Bertha in a
dissertation.</p>
<p>When Ph&oelig;be was gone, Robert found it less difficult to
force Lucilla to the extremity of a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; Young Randolf was
less in the house, and, when there, more with Owen than before,
and Lucilla was necessarily sometimes to be caught alone in the
drawing-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucy,&rsquo; said Robert, the first time this occurred,
&lsquo;I have a question to ask you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo;&mdash;she turned round half defiant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A correspondent of Mervyn, on the Spanish coast, has
written to ask him to find a chaplain for the place, guaranteeing
a handsome stipend.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 516--><a name="page516"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
516</span>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Lucilla, in a cold voice this
time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wished to ask whether you thought it would be
acceptable to Mr. Prendergast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I neither know nor care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Robert, after a pause;
&lsquo;but though I believe I learnt it sooner than I ought, I
was sincerely glad to hear&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then unhear!&rsquo; said Lucilla, pettishly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You, at least, ought to be glad of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means,&rsquo; returned Robert, gravely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have far too great a regard for you not to be most
deeply concerned at what I see is making you unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May not I be unhappy if I like, with my brother in this
state?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not all, Lucilla.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then never mind!&nbsp; You are the only one who never
pitied me, and so I like you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t spoil it
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need not be afraid of my pitying you if you have
brought on this misunderstanding by your old spirit!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit of it!&nbsp; I tell you he pitied me.&nbsp; I
found it out in time, so I set him free.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that was the offence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Offence!&nbsp; What are you talking of?&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t offend&mdash;No, but when I said I could not bring
so many upon him, and could not have Owen teased about the thing,
he said he would bother me no more, that I had Owen, and did not
want him.&nbsp; And then he walked off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Taking you at your word?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just as if one might not say what one does not mean
when one wants a little comforting,&rsquo; said Lucy, pouting;
&lsquo;but, after all, it is a very good thing&mdash;he is saved
a great plague for a very little time, and if it were all pity,
so much the better.&nbsp; I say, Robin, shall you be man enough
to read the service over me, just where we stood at poor
Edna&rsquo;s funeral?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that concerns you much,&rsquo; said
Robert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the lady in Madge Wildfire&rsquo;s song was
gratified at the &ldquo;six brave gentlemen&rdquo; who
&ldquo;kirkward should carry her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should you
deprive me of that satisfaction?&nbsp; Really, Robin, it is quite
true.&nbsp; A little happiness might have patched me up,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The symptoms are recurring?&nbsp; Have you seen
F---?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Let me alone, Robin.&nbsp; It is the truest
mercy to let me wither up with as little trouble as possible to
those who don&rsquo;t want me.&nbsp; Now that you know it, I am
glad I can talk to you, and you will help me to think of what has
never been enough before my eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Robert made no answer but a hasty good-bye, and was gone.</p>
<p>Lucilla gave a heavy sigh, and then exclaimed,
half-aloud&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, the horrid little monster that I am.&nbsp; Why
can&rsquo;t I help it?&nbsp; I verily believe I shall flirt in my
shroud, and if I were canonized my first miracle would be like
St. Philomena&rsquo;s, to make my own relics
presentable!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 517--><a name="page517"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
517</span>Wherewith she fell a laughing, with a laughter that
soon turned to tears, and the exclamation, &lsquo;Why can I make
nobody care for me but those I can&rsquo;t care for?&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t help disgusting all that is good, and it will be well
when I am dead and gone.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only one that will
shed tears good for anything, and he is well quit of
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor little lonely thing wept again, and after her many
sleepless nights, she fairly cried herself to sleep.&nbsp; She
awoke with a start, at some one being admitted into the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, am I disturbing you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the well-known voice, and she sprang up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Pendy, Mr. Pendy, I was very naughty!&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t mean it.&nbsp; Oh, will you bear with me again,
though I don&rsquo;t deserve it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She clung to him like a child wearied with its own
naughtiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was too hasty,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I forgot how
wrapped up you were in your brother, and how little attention you
could spare, and then I thought that in him you had found all you
wanted, and that I was only in your way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you know better than
to think that people put their brothers before their&mdash;Mr.
Pendys?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seemed to wish to do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but you should have known it was only for the sake
of being coaxed!&rsquo; said Lucilla, hanging her head on one
side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have told me so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how was I to know it?&rsquo;&nbsp; And she broke
out into a very different kind of laughter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I thought it was all magnanimity, but it is
of no use to die of one&rsquo;s own magnanimity, you
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not going to die; you are coming to this
Spanish place, which will give you lungs of brass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spanish place?&nbsp; How do you know?&nbsp; I have not
slept into to-morrow, have I?&nbsp; That Robin has not flown to
Wrapworth and back since three o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I was only inquiring at Mrs.
Murrell&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you silly, silly person, why couldn&rsquo;t you
come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not want to bother you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, for shame; if you say that again I shall
know you have not forgiven me.&nbsp; It is a moral against using
words too strong for the occasion!&nbsp; So Robert carried you
the offer of the chaplaincy, and you mean to have it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not help coming, as he desired, to see what you
thought of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only know,&rsquo; she said, half crying, yet
laughing, &lsquo;that you had better marry me out of hand before
I get into any more mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The chaplaincy was promising.&nbsp; The place was on the
lovely coast of Andalusia.&nbsp; There was a small colony of
English engaged in trade, and the place was getting into favour
with invalids.&nbsp; Mervyn&rsquo;s correspondent was anxious to
secure the services of a good man, and the society of a lady-like
wife, and <!-- page 518--><a name="page518"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 518</span>offered to guarantee a handsome
salary, such as justified the curate in giving up his chance of a
college living; and though it was improbable that he would ever
learn a word of Spanish, or even get so far as the pronunciation
of the name of the place, the advantages that the appointment
offered were too great to be rejected, when Lucilla&rsquo;s
health needed a southern climate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! yes, yes, let us go,&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It will be a great deal better than anything at home can
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you venture on telling Owen, now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; It was a mere delusion of mine that it
would cost him anything.&nbsp; Honor is all that he wants, I am
rather in their way than otherwise.&nbsp; He rests on her
down-pillow-ship, and she sees, hears, knows nothing but
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Miss Charlecote aware of&mdash;what has been going
wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not she!&nbsp; I told her before that I should take my
own time for the communication, and I verily believe she has
forgotten all about it!&nbsp; Then little demure Ph&oelig;be fell
over head and ears in love with the backwoodsman on the spot, and
walked about in a dream such as ought to have been good fun to
watch, if I had had the spirit for it; and if Robert had not been
sufficiently disengaged to keep his eyes open, I don&rsquo;t know
whether anything would have roused them short of breaking a
blood-vessel or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall never rest till you are in my keeping!&nbsp; I
will go to Fulmort at once, and tell him that I
accept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I will go to Owen, and break the news to him.&nbsp;
When are you coming again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow, as soon as I have opened school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! the sooner we are gone the better!&nbsp; Much good
you can be to poor Wrapworth!&nbsp; Just tell me, please, that I
may know how badly I served you, how often you have inquired at
Mrs. Murrell&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&mdash;I believe&mdash;each day except Saturday and
Sunday; but I never met him there till just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lucilla&rsquo;s eyes swam with tears; she laid her head on his
shoulder, and, in a broken voice of deep emotion, she said,
&lsquo;Indeed, I did not deserve it!&nbsp; But I think I shall be
good now, for I can&rsquo;t tell why I should be so much
loved!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Prendergast was vainly endeavouring to tell her why, when
Humfrey Randolf&rsquo;s ring was heard, and she rushed out of the
room.</p>
<p>Owen&rsquo;s first hearty laugh since his return was at her
tidings.&nbsp; That over, he spoke with brotherly kindness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Lucy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I do think it is the
best and happiest thing for you.&nbsp; He is the only man whom
you could not torment to death, or who would have any patience
with your antics.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall try,&rsquo; said
Lucy.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you shaking your head for,
Owen?&nbsp; Have I not had enough to tame me?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 519--><a name="page519"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
519</span>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, Cilly.&nbsp; I was only
thinking of the natural companionship of bears and monkeys.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t beat me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some day you shall come out and see us perform,
that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said Lucilla, merrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
indeed, Owen, if I know myself at all, unmerited affection and
forbearance, with no nonsense about it, is the only way to keep
me from flying out.&nbsp; At any rate, I can&rsquo;t live without
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Owen, gravely, &lsquo;you have suffered
too much through me for me to talk to you in this fashion.&nbsp;
Forgive me, Lucy; I am not up to any other, just yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Lucilla might have said in the first relief of
recovering Mr. Prendergast, she could not easily have made up her
mind to leave her brother in his present condition, and flattered
herself that the &lsquo;<i>at once</i>&rsquo; could not possibly
be speedy, since Mr. Prendergast must give notice of his
intention of leaving Wrapworth.</p>
<p>But when he came the next morning, it proved that things were
in a far greater state of forwardness than she had thought
possible.&nbsp; So convinced were both the curate and Robert of
the need of her avoiding the winter cold, that the latter had
suggested that one of his own curates, who was in need of change
and country air, should immediately offer himself as a substitute
at Wrapworth, either for a time or permanently, and Lucy was
positively required to name a day as early as possible for the
marriage, and told, on the authority of the physician, that it
might almost be called suicide to linger in the English
frosts.</p>
<p>The day which she chose was the 1st of December, the same on
which Mervyn was to be married.&nbsp; There was a purpose in thus
rendering it impracticable for any Fulmort to be present;
&lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;I am glad it should be
before I am about.&nbsp; I could never keep my countenance if I
had to give her away to brother Peter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keeping his countenance&rsquo; might have two meanings,
but he was too feeble for agitation, and seemed only able to go
through the time of preparation and parting, by keeping himself
as lethargic and indifferent as possible, or by turning matters
into a jest when necessarily brought before him.&nbsp; Playing at
solitaire, or trifling desultory chat, was all that he could
endure as occupation, and the long hours were grievously
heavy.&nbsp; His son, though nearly four years old, was no
companion or pleasure to him.&nbsp; He was, in his helpless and
morbid state, afraid of so young a child, and little Owen was
equally afraid of him; each dreaded contact with the other, and
more than all the being shut into a room together; and the little
boy, half shy, half assured, filled by the old woman with notions
of his own grandeur, and yet constrained by the different
atmosphere of Woolstone-lane, was never at ease or playful enough
before him to be pleasant to watch.&nbsp; And, indeed, his
Cockney pronunciation and ungainly vulgar tricks had been so
summarily <!-- page 520--><a name="page520"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 520</span>repressed by his aunt, that his fear
of both the ladies rendered him particularly unengaging and
unchildlike.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Honora thought it her duty to
take him home with her to the Holt, and gratified Robert by
engaging a nice little girl of fourteen, whom Lucilla called the
crack orphan, to be his attendant when they should leave
town.&nbsp; This was to be about a fortnight after the wedding,
since St. Wulstan&rsquo;s afforded greater opportunities for
privacy and exemption from bustle than even Hiltonbury, and Dr.
Prendergast and his daughter could attend without being in the
house.</p>
<p>The Prendergasts of Southminster were very kind and friendly,
sending Lucilla warm greetings, and not appearing at all
disconcerted at welcoming their former governess into the
family.&nbsp; The elders professed no surprise, but great
gladness; and Sarah, who <i>was</i> surprised, was trebly
rejoiced.&nbsp; Owen accused his sister of selecting her solitary
bridesmaid with a view to enhancing her own beauty by force of
contrast; but the choice was prompted by real security of the
affectionate pleasure it would confer.&nbsp; Handsome presents
were sent both by the Beaumonts and Bostocks, and Lucilla, even
while half fretted, half touched by Mrs. Bostock&rsquo;s
patronizing felicitations, could not but be pleased at these
evidences that her governess-ship had not been an utter
failure.</p>
<p>Her demeanour in the fortnight before her marriage was unlike
what her friends had ever seen, and made them augur better for
Mr. Prendergast&rsquo;s venture.&nbsp; She was happy, but
subdued; quiet and womanly, gentle without being sad, grave but
not drooping; and though she was cheerful and playful, with an
entire absence of those strange effervescences that had once
betrayed acidity or fermentation.&nbsp; She had found the power
of being affectionately grateful to Honor, and the sweetness of
her tender ways towards her and Owen would have made the parting
all the sadder to them if it had not been evident that, as she
said, it was happiness that thus enabled her to be good.&nbsp;
The satisfied look of rest that had settled on her fair face made
it new.&nbsp; All her animation and archness had not rendered it
half so pleasant to look upon.</p>
<p>The purchaser of Castle Blanch proved to be no other than Mr.
Calthorp!&nbsp; Lucilla at first was greatly discomfited, and
begged that nothing might be said about the picture; but the next
time Mr. Prendergast arrived, it was with a request from Mr.
Calthorp that Miss Sandbrook would accept the picture as a
wedding gift!&nbsp; There was no refusing it&mdash;indeed, the
curate had already accepted it; and when Lucilla heard that
&lsquo;the Calthorp&rsquo; had been two years married to what Mr.
Prendergast called &lsquo;a millionairess, exceedingly
hideous,&rsquo; she still had vanity enough to reflect that the
removal of her own resemblance might be an act of charity!&nbsp;
And the sum that Honor had set apart for the purchase was only
too much wanted for the setting up housekeeping in Spain, whither
the portrait was to accompany <!-- page 521--><a
name="page521"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 521</span>her, Mr.
Prendergast declared, like the Penates of the pious
&AElig;neas!</p>
<p>Robert brought in his gift on the last day of November, just
before setting off for Sutton.&nbsp; It was an unornamented, but
exquisitely-bound Bible and Prayer Book, dark-brown, with
red-edged leaves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Lucilla,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you have been
the brightest spot to me in this life.&nbsp; Thank you for all
you have done for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And for all I never intended to do?&rsquo; said
Lucilla, smiling, as she returned his pressure of the hand.</p>
<p>He was gone, not trusting her to speak, nor himself to hear a
word more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Robin,&rsquo; proceeded Lucy, half aloud,
&lsquo;you are the greater man, I know very well; but it is in
human nature to prefer flesh and blood to medi&aelig;val saints
in cast-iron, even if one knows there is a tender spot in
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a curious sense of humiliation in her full
acquiescence in the fact that he was too high, too grand for her,
and in her relief, that the affection, that would have lifted her
beyond what she was prepared for, had died away, and left her to
the more ordinary excellence and half-paternal fondness of the
man of her real choice, with whom she could feel perfect ease and
repose.&nbsp; Possibly the admixture of qualities that in her had
been called <i>fast</i> is the most contrary to all real
aspiration!</p>
<p>But there was no fault to be found with the heartfelt
affection with which she loved and honoured her bridegroom,
lavishing on him the more marks of deference and submission just
because she knew that her will would be law, and that his love
was strong enough to have borne with any amount of caprice or
seeming neglect.&nbsp; The sacrifices she made, without his
knowledge, for his convenience and comfort, while he imagined
hers to be solely consulted, the concessions she made to his
slightest wish, the entire absence of all teasing, would not have
been granted to a younger man more prepossessing in the sight of
others.</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that she rejected all advice to consult
health rather than custom in her wedding dress.&nbsp; Exactly
because Mr. Prendergast would have willingly received her in the
plainest garb, she was bent on doing him honour by the most
exquisite bridal array; and never had she been so
lovely&mdash;her colour such exquisite carnation, her eyes so
softened, and full of such repose and reliance, her grace so
perfect in complete freedom from all endeavour at attracting
admiration.</p>
<p>The married pair came back from church to Owen&rsquo;s
sitting-room&mdash;not bear and monkey, not genie and fairy, as
he had expected to see; but as they stood together, looking so
indescribably and happily one, that Owen smiled and said,
&lsquo;Ah! Honor, if you had only known twenty years ago that
this was Mrs. Peter Prendergast, how much trouble it would have
saved.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 522--><a name="page522"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
522</span>&lsquo;She did not deserve to be Mrs. Peter
Prendergast,&rsquo; said the bride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See how you deserve it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I never shall!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brother and sister parted with light words but full hearts,
each trying to believe, though neither crediting Mr.
Prendergast&rsquo;s assurance that the two Owens should come and
be at home for ever if they liked in Santa Maria de X---.&nbsp;
Neither could bear to face the truth that henceforth their
courses lay apart, and that if the sister&rsquo;s life were
spared, it could only be at the sacrifice of expatriation for
many years, in lands where, well or ill, the brother had no
call.&nbsp; Nor would Lucilla break down.&nbsp; It was due to her
husband not to let him think she suffered too much in resigning
home for him; and true to her innate hatred of agitation, she
guarded herself from realizing anything, and though perfectly
kind and respectful to Honora, studiously averted all approaches
to effusion of feeling.</p>
<p>Only at the last kiss in the hall, she hung round her friend
with a vehement embrace, and whispered, &lsquo;Forgive!&nbsp; You
have forgiven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive me, Lucilla!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, that I have forgiven you for all your pardon and
patience is shown by my enduring to leave Owen to you
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therewith surged up such a flood of passionate emotions that,
fleeing from them as it were, the bride tore herself out of
Honor&rsquo;s arms, and sprang hastily into the carriage,
nervously and hastily moving about its contents while Mr.
Prendergast finished his farewells.</p>
<p>After all, there was a certain sense of rest, snugness, and
freedom from turmoil, when Honor dried her eyes and went back to
her convalescent.&nbsp; The house seemed peaceful, and they both
felt themselves entering into the full enjoyment of being all in
all to one another.</p>
<p>There was one guest at the Sutton wedding whose spirit was at
St. Wulstan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In those set eyes, and tightly-closed
lips, might be traced abstraction in spite of himself.&nbsp; Were
there not thoughts and prayers for another bride, elsewhere
kneeling?&nbsp; Was not the solitary man struggling with the last
remnants of fancies at war with his life of self-devotion, and
crushing down the few final regrets, that would have looked back
to the dreams of his youth.&nbsp; No marvel that his greatest
effort was against being harsh and unsympathizing, even while his
whole career was an endeavour to work through charities of deed
and word into charities of thought and judgment.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Slow to choose, but decided in her choice, Ph&oelig;be had
always been, and her love formed no exception to this rule.&nbsp;
She was quite aware that her heart had been given away, and never
concealed it from herself, though she made it a principle not to
indulge in future castle buildings, and kept a resolute guard
over her attention.&nbsp; It was impossible to obviate a
perpetual feeling of restlessness and of tedium in whatever she
was about; but she conquered oftener than she gave way, and there
was an indescribable sense of peace and sweetness in a new and
precious possession, and an undefined hope through all.</p>
<p>Miss Fennimore, who came the day after the girls&rsquo; return
from Sutton, saw only the fuller development of her favourite
pupil, and, in truth, Maria and Bertha had so ineffably much to
narrate, that her attention would have been sufficiently
engrossed to hinder her observation of the symptoms, even had the
good lady been as keen and experienced in love as in science.</p>
<p>Poor little Ph&oelig;be! equable as she was, she was in a
great perturbation when, four days before Christmas, she knew
that Miss Charlecote, with Owen Sandbrook and Humfrey Randolf,
had arrived at the Holt.&nbsp; What was so natural as for her to
go at once to talk over the two weddings with her dear old
friend?&nbsp; Yes, but did her dear old friend want her, when
these two young men had put an end to her solitude?&nbsp; Was she
only making Miss Charlecote an excuse?&nbsp; She would wait in
hopes that one of the others would ask if she were going to the
Holt!&nbsp; If so, it could not but be natural and
proper&mdash;if not&mdash;&nbsp; This provoking throbbing of her
heart showed that it was not only for Honor Charlecote that she
wished to go.</p>
<p>That ring at the bell!&nbsp; What an abominable goose she was
to find a flush of expectation in her cheek!&nbsp; And after all
it was only Sir John.&nbsp; He had found that his son had heard
nothing from the Holt that morning, and had come in to ask if she
thought a call would be acceptable.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew they were
come home,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for I saw them at the station
yesterday.&nbsp; I did not show myself, for I did not know how
poor young Sandbrook might like it.&nbsp; But who have they got
with them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Randolf, Owen Sandbrook&rsquo;s Canadian
friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I not hear he was some sort of relation?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 524--><a name="page524"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
524</span>&lsquo;Yes; his mother was a Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! that accounts for it.&nbsp; Seeing him with her, I
could almost have thought it was thirty years ago, and that it
was my dear old friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could have embraced Sir John.&nbsp; She could not
conceal her glow of delight so completely that Bertha did not
laugh and say, &lsquo;Mr. Charlecote is what the Germans would
call Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s <i>Bild</i>.&nbsp; She always blushes
and looks conscious if he is mentioned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir John laughed, but with some emotion, and Ph&oelig;be
hastily turned her still more blushing face away.&nbsp;
Certainly, if Ph&oelig;be had had any prevision of her present
state of mind, she never would have bought that chiffonier.</p>
<p>When Sir John had sufficiently admired the details of the
choice little drawing-room, and had been shown by the eager
sisters all over the house, he asked if Ph&oelig;be would walk up
with him to the Holt.&nbsp; He had hoped his eldest son, who had
ridden over with him, would have come in, and gone up with them,
but he supposed Charlie had seized on him.&nbsp; (Poor Sir John,
his attempt at match-making did not flourish.)&nbsp; However, he
had secured Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s most intense gratitude by his
proposal, and down she came, a very pretty picture, in her dark
brown dress, scarlet cloak, and round, brown felt hat, with the
long, curly, brown feather tipped with scarlet, her favourite
winter robin colouring.&nbsp; Her cheeks were brilliant, and her
eyes not only brighter, but with a slight drooping that gave them
the shadiness they sometimes wanted.&nbsp; And it was all from a
ridiculous trepidation which made it well-nigh impossible to
bring out what she was longing to say&mdash;&lsquo;So you think
Mr. Randolf like Mr. Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately he was beforehand with her, for both the likeness
and the path through the pine woods reminded him strongly of his
old friend, and he returned to the subject.&nbsp; &lsquo;So you
are a great admirer of dear old Charlecote, Ph&oelig;be: you
can&rsquo;t remember him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but Robert does, and I sometimes think I
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Then it came.)&nbsp; &lsquo;You think Mr.
Randolf like him?&rsquo;&nbsp; Thanks to her hat, she could blush
more comfortably now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not see him near.&nbsp; It was only something in
air and figure.&nbsp; People inherit those things
wonderfully.&nbsp; Now, my son Charlie sits on horseback exactly
like his grandfather, whom he never saw; and
John&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh! was he going to run away on family likenesses?&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be would not hear the &lsquo;and John;&rsquo; and
observed, &lsquo;Mr. Charlecote was his godfather, was he
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which self-evident fact brought him back again to &lsquo;Yes;
and I only wish he had seen more of him!&nbsp; These are his
plantations, I declare, that he used to make so much
of!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that is the reason Miss Charlecote is so fond of
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote!&nbsp; When I think of him, I have no
patience with her.&nbsp; I do believe he kept single all his life
for her sake: <!-- page 525--><a name="page525"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 525</span>and why she never would have him I
never could guess.&nbsp; You ladies are very unreasonable
sometimes, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be tried to express a rational amount of wonder at
poor Honor&rsquo;s taste, but grew incoherent in fear lest it
should be irrational, and was rather frightened at finding Sir
John looking at her with some amusement; but he was only thinking
of how willingly the poor little heiress of the Mervyns had once
been thrown at Humfrey Charlecote&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; But he went
on to tell her of all that her hero had ever been to him and to
the county, and of the blank his death had left, and never since
supplied, till she felt more and more what a &lsquo;wise&rsquo;
man truly was!</p>
<p>No one was in the drawing-room, but Honor came down much more
cheerful and lively than she had been for years, and calling Owen
materially better&mdash;the doctors thought the injury to the
head infinitely mitigated, and the first step to recovery fairly
taken&mdash;there were good accounts of the Prendergasts, and all
things seemed to be looking well.&nbsp; Presently Sir John, to
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s great satisfaction, spoke of her guest, and
his resemblance, but Honor answered with half-resentful
surprise.&nbsp; Some of the old servants had made the same
remark, but she could not understand it, and was evidently hurt
by its recurrence.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be sat on, listening to the
account of Lucilla&rsquo;s letters, and the good spirits and
health they manifested; forcing herself not too obviously to
watch door or window, and when Sir John was gone, she only
offered to depart, lest Miss Charlecote should wish to be with
Owen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear, thank you; Mr. Randolf is with him, and he
can read a little now.&nbsp; We are getting above the solitaire
board, I assure you.&nbsp; I have fitted up the little room
beyond the study for his bedroom, and he sits in the study, so
there are no stairs, and he is to go out every day in a chair or
the carriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does the little boy amuse him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not exactly, poor little fellow.&nbsp; They are
terribly afraid of each other, that is the worst of it.&nbsp; And
then we left the boy too long with the old woman.&nbsp; I hear
his lessons for a quarter of an hour a day, and he is a clever
child enough; but his pronunciation and habits are an absolute
distress, and he is not happy anywhere but in the
housekeeper&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; I try to civilize him, but as yet
I cannot worry poor Owen.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t think how
comfortable we are together, Ph&oelig;be, when we are
alone.&nbsp; Since his sister went we have got on so much
better.&nbsp; He was shy before her; but I must tell you, my
dear, he asked me to read my Psalms and Lessons aloud, as I used
to do; and we have had such pleasant evenings, and he desired
that the servants might still come in to prayers in the
study.&nbsp; But then he always was different with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Ph&oelig;be, while assenting, could not silence a
misgiving that she thought very cruel.&nbsp; She would believe
Owen sincere if Humfrey Randolf did.&nbsp; Honor, however, was
very happy, and presently begged her to come and see Owen.&nbsp;
She obeyed with <!-- page 526--><a name="page526"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 526</span>alacrity, and was conducted to the
study.&nbsp; No Randolf was there, only pen, ink, paper, and
algebra.&nbsp; But as she was greeting Owen, who looked much
better and less oppressed, Honor made an exclamation, and from
the window they saw the young man leaning over the sundial,
partly studying its mysteries, partly playing with little Owen,
who hung on him as an old playmate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;he has taken pity on the
boy&mdash;he is very good to him&mdash;has served an
apprenticeship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Randolf looked up, saw Ph&oelig;be, gave a start of
recognition and pleasure, and sped towards the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Ph&oelig;be, I do see <i>some</i> likeness,&rsquo;
said Honor, as though a good deal struck and touched.</p>
<p>All the ridiculous and troublesome confusion was so good as to
be driven away in the contentment of Humfrey Randolf&rsquo;s
presence, and the wondrous magnetic conviction that he was
equally glad to be with her.&nbsp; She lost all restlessness, and
was quite ready to amuse Owen by a lively discussion and
comparison of the two weddings, but she so well knew that she
should like to stay too long, that she cut her time rather over
short, and would not stay to luncheon.&nbsp; This was not like
the evenings that began with Hiawatha and ended at Lakeville, or
on Lake Ontario; but one pleasure was in store for
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; While she was finding her umbrella, and
putting on her clogs, Humfrey Randolf ran down-stairs to her, and
said, &lsquo;I wanted to tell you something.&nbsp; My stepmother
is going to be married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are glad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very glad.&nbsp; It is to a merchant whom she met at
Buffalo, well off, and speaking most kindly of the little
boys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must be a great load off your mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed it is, though the children must still chiefly
look to me.&nbsp; I should like to have little George at a good
school.&nbsp; However, now their immediate maintenance is off my
hands, I have more to spend in educating myself.&nbsp; I can get
evening lessons now, when my day&rsquo;s work is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! do not overstrain your head,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be, thinking of Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heads can bear a good deal when they are full of
hope,&rsquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still after your out-of-doors life of bodily exercise,
do you not find it hard to be always shut up in
London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps the novelty has not worn off.&nbsp; It is as if
life had only begun since I came into the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A new set of faculties called into play?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faculties&mdash;yes, and everything else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go now, or my sisters will be waiting for me,
and I see your dinner coming in.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I come to see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, pray let me show you our cottage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When may I come?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 527--><a name="page527"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
527</span>&lsquo;To-morrow, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She felt, rather than saw him watching her all the way from
the garden-gate to the wood.&nbsp; That little colloquy was the
sunshiny point in her day.&nbsp; Had the tidings been
communicated in the full circle, it would have been as nothing
compared with their reservation for her private ear, with the
marked &lsquo;I wanted to tell <i>you</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she
came home, looked at Maria threading holly-berries, and her heart
fainted within her.&nbsp; There were moments when poor Maria
would rise before her as a hardship and an infliction, and then
she became terrified, prayed against such feelings as a crime,
and devoted herself to her sister with even more than her wonted
patient tenderness.</p>
<p>The certainty that the visit would take place kept her from
all flutterings and self-debate, and in due time Mr. Randolf
arrived.&nbsp; Anxiously did Ph&oelig;be watch for his look at
Maria, for Bertha&rsquo;s look at him, and she was pleased with
both.&nbsp; His manner to Maria was full of gentleness, and
Bertha&rsquo;s quick eyes detected his intellect.&nbsp; He stood
an excellent examination from her and Miss Fennimore upon the
worn channel of Niagara, which had so often been used as a
knockdown argument against Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s cosmogony; and
his bright terse powers of description gave them, as they agreed,
a better idea of his woods than any travels which they had
read.</p>
<p>It was no less interesting to observe his impression of the
English village-life at Hiltonbury.&nbsp; To him, the aspect of
the country had an air of exquisite miniature finish, wanting
indeed in breadth and freedom, but he had suffered too much from
vain struggling single-handed with Nature in her might, not to
value the bounds set upon her; and a man who knew by personal
experience what it was to seek his whole live stock in an
interminable forest, did not complain of the confinement of
hedges and banks.&nbsp; Nay, the &lsquo;hedgerow elms and
hillocks green&rsquo; were to him as classical as Whitehall; he
treated Maria&rsquo;s tame robins with as much respect as if they
had been Howards or Percies; holly and mistletoe were handled by
him with reverential curiosity; and the church and home of his
ancestors filled him with a sweet loyal enthusiasm, more eager
than in those to whom these things were familiar.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote herself came in for some of these
feelings.&nbsp; He admired her greatly in her Christmas aspect of
Lady Bountiful, in which she well fulfilled old visions of the
mistress of an English home, but still more did he dwell upon her
gentleness, and on that shadowy resemblance to his mother, which
made him long for some of that tenderness which she lavished upon
Owen.&nbsp; He looked for no more than her uniformly kind
civility and hospitality, but he was always wishing to know her
better; and any touch of warmth and affection in her manner
towards him was so delightful that he could not help telling
Ph&oelig;be of it, in their next brief
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>
<p>He was able to render a great service to Miss
Charlecote.&nbsp; <!-- page 528--><a name="page528"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 528</span>Mr. Brooks&rsquo;s understanding had
not cleared with time, and the accounts that had been tangled in
summer were by the end of the year in confusion worse
confounded.&nbsp; He was a faithful servant, but his accounts had
always been audited every month, and in his old age, his
arithmetic would not carry him farther, so that his
mistress&rsquo;s long absence abroad had occasioned such a
hopeless chaos, that but for his long services, his honesty might
have been in question.&nbsp; Honora put this idea away with angry
horror.&nbsp; Not only did she love and trust the old man, but he
was a legacy from Humfrey, and she would have torn the page from
her receipts rather than rouse the least suspicion against
him.&nbsp; Yet she could not bear to leave any flaw in
Humfrey&rsquo;s farm books, and she toiled and perplexed herself
in vain; till Owen, finding out what distressed her, and grieving
at his own incapacity, begged that Randolf might help her; when
behold! the confused accounts arranged themselves in
comprehensible columns, and poor old Brooks was proved to have
cheated himself so much more than his lady as to be entirely
exonerated from all but puzzle-headedness.&nbsp; The young
man&rsquo;s farmer life qualified him to be highly popular at the
Holt.&nbsp; He was curious about English husbandry, talked to the
labourers, and tried their tools with no unpractised hand, even
the flail which Honor&rsquo;s hatred of steam still kept as the
winter&rsquo;s employment in the barn; he appreciated the
bullocks, criticized the sheep, and admired the pigs, till the
farming men agreed &lsquo;there had not been such an one about
the place since the Squire himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora might be excused for not having detected a likeness
between the two Humfreys.&nbsp; Scarcely a feature was in the
same mould, the complexion was different, and the heavily-built,
easy-going Squire, somewhat behind his own century, had
apparently had nothing in common with the brisk modern colonial
engineer; yet still there was something curiously recalling the
expression of open honesty, and the whole cast of countenance, as
well as the individuality of voice, air, and gestures, and the
perception grew upon her so much in the haunts of her cousin,
where she saw his attitudes and habits unconsciously repeated,
that she was almost ready to accept Bertha&rsquo;s explanation
that it was owing to the influence of the Christian name that
both shared.&nbsp; But as it had likewise been borne by the
wicked disinherited son who ran away, the theory was somewhat
halting.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s intercourse with Humfrey the younger was
much more fragmentary than in town, and therefore, perhaps, the
more delicious.&nbsp; She saw him on most of the days of his
fortnight&rsquo;s stay, either in the mutual calls of the two
houses, in chance meetings in the village, or in walks to or from
the holy-day services at the church, and these afforded many a
moment in which she was let into the deeper feelings that his
first English Christmas excited.&nbsp; It was not conventional
Christmas weather, but warm and moist, thus rendering the
contrast still <!-- page 529--><a name="page529"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 529</span>stronger with the sleighing of his
prosperous days, the snowshoe walk of his poorer ones.&nbsp; A
frost hard enough for skating was the prime desire of Maria and
Bertha, who both wanted to see the art practised by one to whom
it was familiar.&nbsp; The frost came at last, and became
reasonably hard in the first week of the new year, one day when
Ph&oelig;be, to her regret, was forced to drive to Elverslope to
fulfil some commissions for Mervyn and Cecily, who were expected
at home on the 8th of January, after a Christmas at Sutton.</p>
<p>However, she had a reward.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do think,&rsquo;
said Miss Fennimore to her, as she entered the drawing-room,
&lsquo;that Mr. Randolf is the most good-natured man in the
world!&nbsp; For full three-quarters of an hour this afternoon
did he hand Maria up and down a slide on the pond at the
Holt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You went up to see him skate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; he was to teach Bertha.&nbsp; We found him helping
the little Sandbrook to slide, but when we came he sent him in
with the little maid, and gave Bertha a lesson, which did not
last long, for she grew nervous.&nbsp; Really her nerves will
never be what they were!&nbsp; Then Maria begged for a slide, and
you know what any sort of monotonous bodily motion is to her;
there is no getting her to leave off, and I never saw anything
like the spirit and good-nature with which he
complied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is <i>very</i> kind to Maria,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He seems to have that sort of pitying respect which you
first put into my mind towards her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, are you come home, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; said Maria,
running into the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not hear you.&nbsp; I
have been sliding on the ice all the afternoon with Mr.
Randolf.&nbsp; It is so nice, and he says we will do it again
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; said Bertha, meeting her on the
stairs, &lsquo;do you know what you missed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three children sliding on the ice,&rsquo; quoted
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seeing how a man that is called Humfrey can bear with
your two sisters making themselves ridiculous.&nbsp; Really I
should set the backwoods down as the best school of courtesy, but
that I believe some people have that school within
themselves.&nbsp; Hollo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Ph&oelig;be absolutely kissed Bertha as she went
up-stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha?&rsquo; said Bertha, interrogatively; then went into
the drawing-room, and looked very grave, almost sad.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be could not but think it rather hard when, on the
last afternoon of Humfrey Randolf&rsquo;s visit, there came a
note from Mervyn ordering her up to Beauchamp to arrange some
special contrivances of his for Cecily&rsquo;s
morning-room&mdash;her mother&rsquo;s, which gave it an
additional pang.&nbsp; It was a severe, threatening, bitterly
cold day, not at all fit for sliding, even had not both the young
ladies and Miss Fennimore picked up a suspicion of cold; but
Ph&oelig;be had no doubt that there would be a farewell visit,
and did not like to lose it.</p>
<p><!-- page 530--><a name="page530"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
530</span>&lsquo;Take the pony carriage, and you will get home
faster,&rsquo; said Bertha, answering what was unspoken.</p>
<p>No; the groom sent in word that the ponies were gone to be
rough-shod, and that one of them had a cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, cheerfully;
&lsquo;I shall be warmer walking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she set off, with a lingering will, but a step brisk under
her determination that her personal wishes should never make her
neglect duty or kindness.&nbsp; She did not like to think that he
would be disappointed, but she had a great trust in <i>his</i>
trust in herself, and a confidence, not to be fretted away, that
some farewell would come to pass, and that she should know when
to look for him again.</p>
<p>Scanty sleety flakes of snow were falling before her
half-hour&rsquo;s walk was over, and she arrived at the house,
where anxious maids were putting their last touches of
preparation for the mistress.&nbsp; It was strange not to feel
more strongly the pang of a lost home; and had not Ph&oelig;be
been so much preoccupied, perhaps it would have affected her
strongly, with all her real joy at Cecily&rsquo;s installation;
but there were new things before her that filled her mind too
full for regrets for the rooms where she had grown up.&nbsp; She
only did her duty scrupulously by Cecily&rsquo;s writing-table,
piano, and pictures, and then satisfied the housekeeper by a
brief inspection of the rooms, more laudatory than
particular.&nbsp; She rather pitied Cecily, after her comfortable
parsonage, for coming to all those state drawing-rooms.&nbsp; If
it had been the west wing, now!</p>
<p>By this time the snow was thicker, and the park beginning to
whiten.&nbsp; The housekeeper begged her to wait and order out
the carriage, but she disliked giving trouble, and thought that
an unexpected summons might be tardy of fulfilment, so she
insisted on confronting the elements, confident in her cloak and
india-rubber boots, and secretly hoping that the visitor at the
cottage might linger on into the twilight.</p>
<p>As she came beyond the pillars of the portico, such a whirl of
snow met her that she almost questioned the prudence of her
decision, when a voice said, &lsquo;It is only the drift round
the corner of the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sister gave me leave to come and see you home
through the snow-storm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you!&nbsp; This is the first time you have
been here,&rsquo; she added, feeling as if her first words had
been too eagerly glad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have only seen the house from a distance
before.&nbsp; I did not know how large it was.&nbsp; Which part
did you inhabit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;the west wing&mdash;shut up now, poor
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where was the window where you saw the horse and
cart?&nbsp; Yes, you see I know that story; which was your
window?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The nearest to the main body of the house.&nbsp; Ah! it
is a <!-- page 531--><a name="page531"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 531</span>dear old window.&nbsp; I have seen
many better things from it than that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sunsets and moonsets, and the Holt firs best of
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know better now what you meant by owing all to
Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; he said, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I owe
something to her, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, is she going to help you on?&rsquo; cried
Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I do not need that.&nbsp; What I owe to her
is&mdash;knowing you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It had come, then!&nbsp; The first moment of full assurance of
what had gleamed before; and yet the shock, sweet as it was, was
almost pain, and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart beat fast, and her
downcast look betrayed that the full force of his words&mdash;and
still more, of his tone&mdash;had reached her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I go on?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I dare to
tell you what you are to me?&nbsp; I knew, from the moment we
met, that you were what I had dreamt of&mdash;different, but
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I knew that you were!&rsquo; escaped from
Ph&oelig;be, softly, but making her face burn, as at what she had
not meant to say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you can bear with me?&nbsp; You do not forbid me
to hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I am a great deal too happy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There came a great wailing, driving gust of storm at that
moment, as if it wanted to sweep them off their feet, but it was
a welcome blast, for it was the occasion of a strong arm being
flung round Ph&oelig;be, to restrain that fluttering cloak.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Storms shall only blow us nearer together, dearest,&rsquo;
he said, with recovered breath, as, with no unwilling hand, she
clung to his arm for help.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be God&rsquo;s will,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
earnestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And indeed,&rsquo; he said, fervently, &lsquo;I have
thought and debated much whether it were His will; whether it
could be right, that I, with my poverty and my burthens, should
thrust myself into your wealthy and sheltered life.&nbsp; At
first, when I thought you were a poor dependent, I admitted the
hope.&nbsp; I saw you spirited, helpful, sensible, and I dared to
think that you were of the stuff that would gladly be
independent, and would struggle on and up with me, as I have
known so many do in my own country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! would I not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I found how far apart we stand in one kind of
social scale, and perhaps that ought to have overthrown all hope;
but, Ph&oelig;be, it will not do so!&nbsp; I will not ask you to
share want and privation, but I will and do ask you to be the
point towards which I may work, the best earthly hope set before
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;that you
knew too well to think there was any real difference.&nbsp;
Indeed, the superiority is all yours, except in mere money.&nbsp;
And mine, I am sure, need not stand in the way, but there is one
thing that does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Your brothers?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 532--><a name="page532"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
532</span>&lsquo;I do not know.&nbsp; It is my sister
Maria.&nbsp; I promised long ago that nothing should make me
desert her;&rsquo; and, with a voice faltering a little, but
endeavouring to be firm, &lsquo;a promise to fulfil a duty
appointed by Providence must not he repented of when the cost is
felt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why should you think of deserting her?&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely I may help to bear your cares; and
there is something so good, so gentle and lovable about her, that
she need be no grievance.&nbsp; I shall have to bring my little
brothers about you, too, so we shall be even,&rsquo; he added,
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; she said, looking in his face as beginning
to take counsel with him, &lsquo;you think it is right to assume
a new tie that must have higher claims than the prior one that
Heaven sent me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, dearest, is not the new one instituted by
Heaven?&nbsp; If I promise that I will be as entirely
Maria&rsquo;s brother as you are her sister, and will reverence
her affliction, or more truly her innocence, in the same way,
will you not trust her, as well as yourself, with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust, oh! indeed I do, and am thankful.&nbsp; But I am
thinking of you!&nbsp; Poor dear Maria might be a drag, where I
should not!&nbsp; And I cannot leave her to any of the
others.&nbsp; She could not be long without me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, faithless one, we may have to wait the longer;
though I feel that you alone would be happiest fighting up the
hill with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you for knowing that so well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But as we both have these ties, and as, besides, I
should be a shabby adventurer to address you but on equal terms,
we must be content to wait till&mdash;as with God&rsquo;s
blessing I trust to do&mdash;I have made a home smooth enough for
Maria as well as for you!&nbsp; Will that do,
Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somehow it seems too much,&rsquo; murmured Ph&oelig;be;
&lsquo;and yet I knew it of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And as you both have means of your own, it may bring
the time nearer,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There, you see I
can calculate on your fortune, though I still wish it were out of
the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it were not for Maria, I should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now with this hope and promise, I feel as if, even
if it were seven years, they would be like so many days,&rsquo;
said Humfrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will not be of those, my
Ph&oelig;be, who suffer and are worn by a long
engagement?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One cannot tell without a trial,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be; &lsquo;but indeed I do not see why security and
rest, or even hope deferred, should hurt me.&nbsp; Surely, having
a right to think about you cannot do so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And her look out of those honest clear gray eyes was one of
the most perfect reliance and gladness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I be worthy of those thoughts!&rsquo; he fervently
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you will write to me&mdash;even when I go
back to the Ottawa?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 533--><a name="page533"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
533</span>&lsquo;I shall be so glad to tell you everything, and
have your letters!&nbsp; Oh! no, with them I am not going to
pine&rsquo;&mdash;and her strong young nature laughed at the
folly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And while God gives me strength, we will not be
afraid,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ph&oelig;be, I looked at
the last chapter of Proverbs last night, and thought you were
like that woman of strength and skill on whose &ldquo;lips is the
law of kindness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;you are not afraid of
the snow,&rdquo; as if to complete the likeness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not quite know it was snowing.&nbsp; I like it,
for it suits your country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like it, because you are as clear, firm, and pure as
my own clear crystal ice,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;only not quite
so cold!&nbsp; And now, what remains?&nbsp; Must your brothers be
consulted?&rsquo; he added, reluctantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be right that I should tell them,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;From Robert I could not keep such a
thing, and Mervyn has a right to know.&nbsp; I cannot tell how he
may take it, but I do not think that I owe him such implicit
obedience as if he were my father.&nbsp; And by the time you
really ask for me, you know you are to be such a rising engineer
that they are all to be almost as proud of you as I
am!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God helping me,&rsquo; he gravely answered, his eyes
raised upwards, and as it were carrying with them the glance that
had sought them in almost playful confidence.</p>
<p>And thus they looked forth upon this life.&nbsp; Neither was
so young as not to be aware of its trials.&nbsp; She knew the
sorrows of suspense, bereavement, and family disunion; and he,
before his twenty-fourth year, had made experience of adversity,
uncongeniality, disappointment, and severe&mdash;almost
hopeless&mdash;everyday labour.&nbsp; It was not in the spirit of
those who had not braced on their armour, but of those who had
made proof of it, that they looked bravely and cheerfully upon
the battle, feeling their strength doubled as faithful
companions-in-arms, and willing in that strength and trust to
bear patiently with the severest trial of all&mdash;the delay of
their hopes.&nbsp; The cold but bracing wind, the snow driving
and whirling round them in gusts, could not daunt nor quench
their spirits&mdash;nay, rather gave them additional vigour and
enjoyment, while even the tokens of the tempest that they bore
away were of perfect dazzling whiteness.</p>
<p>Never was shelter less willingly attained than when the park
wicket of the Underwood was reached, just as the early twilight
was becoming darkness.&nbsp; It was like a foretaste for
Ph&oelig;be of seeing him go his own way in the storm while she
waited safely housed; but they parted with grave sweet smiles,
and a promise that he would snatch a moment&rsquo;s farewell on
the morrow.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be would rather not have been met by
Bertha, at the front door, in some solicitude&mdash;&lsquo;You
are come at last!&nbsp; Are you wet? are you cold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, thank you!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand in the
draught,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, <!-- page 534--><a
name="page534"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 534</span>anxious to
shake her off; but it was not to be done.&nbsp; Bertha preceded
her up-stairs, talking all the way in something of her old
mischievous whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I in disgrace with you, too,
Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; Miss Fennimore says I have committed an awful
breach of propriety; but really I could not leave you to the
beating of the pitiless storm alone.&nbsp; I am afraid
Malta&rsquo;s sagacity and little paws would hardly have sufficed
to dig you out of a snowdrift before life was extinct.&nbsp; Are
you greatly displeased with me, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo;&nbsp; And
being by this time in the bedroom, she faced about, shut the
door, and looked full at her sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;dear Bertha, not displeased in the
least; only if you would go&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Ph&oelig;be, indeed that is not kind of
you,&rsquo; said Bertha, pleadingly, but preparing to obey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Bertha, it is not,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
recovering herself in a moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sorry for it;
but oh! don&rsquo;t you know the feeling of wanting to have
one&rsquo;s treasure all to oneself for a little moment before
showing it?&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t go;&rsquo; and the two sisters
flung their arms round one another.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall hear
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Bertha, kissing her; &lsquo;my time
for obtrusive, childish curiosity is over!&nbsp; I only was so
anxious;&rsquo; and she looked up with tearful eyes, and almost
the air of an elder sister.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be might well requite
the look with full-hearted tenderness and caresses, as she said,
calmly, &lsquo;Yes, Bertha, I am very happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ought to be,&rsquo; said Bertha, seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, taking the <i>ought</i>
in a different sense from what she meant; &lsquo;he is all, and
more, than I ever thought a man wise in true wisdom should
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a man of progress, full of the dignity of
labour,&rsquo; said Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad he is not an
old bit of county soil like John Raymond!&nbsp; My dear
Ph&oelig;be, Sir John will tear his hair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Bertha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I will not tease you with my nonsense; but you
know it is the only thing that keeps tears out of one&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; I see you want to be alone.&nbsp; Dear
Ph&oelig;be!&rsquo; and she clung to her neck for a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An instant more, Bertha.&nbsp; You see everything, I
know; but has Miss Fennimore guessed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear, I do not think any such syllogism has ever
occurred to her as, Lover&rsquo;s look conscious; Ph&oelig;be
looks conscious; therefore Ph&oelig;be is in love!&nbsp; It is
defective in the major, you see, so it could not enter her
brain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Bertha, do not let any one guess it.&nbsp; I
shall speak to Mervyn to-morrow, and write to Robin.&nbsp; It is
their due, but no one else must know it&mdash;no, not for a long
time&mdash;years perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not mean to wait for years?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what&rsquo;s the use of having thirty thousand
pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Bertha, it would not be like him to be content with
<!-- page 535--><a name="page535"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
535</span>owing all to my fortune, and beginning life in
idleness.&nbsp; It would be just enough to live on, with none of
the duties of property, and that would never do!&nbsp; I could
not wish it for him, and he has his brothers to provide
for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let him work for them, and have your money to
make capital!&nbsp; Really, Ph&oelig;be, I would not lose such a
chance of going out and seeing those glorious Lakes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have Maria to consider.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maria!&nbsp; And why are you to be saddled with
Maria?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I promised my mother&mdash;I promised
myself&mdash;I promised Mervyn, that she should be my care.&nbsp;
I have told him of that promise, and he accepts it most
kindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot leave her to me?&nbsp; Oh! Ph&oelig;be, do
you still think me as hateful as I used to be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear Bertha, I have full trust in your affection
for her; but I undertook the charge, and I cannot thrust it on to
another, who might&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; cried Bertha,
impetuously; &lsquo;I am the one to have her!&nbsp; I who
certainly never can, never shall, marry&mdash;I who am good for
nothing but to look after her.&nbsp; Say you do not think me
unworthy of her, Ph&oelig;be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say no such thing,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
affectionately, &lsquo;but there is no use in discussing the
matter.&nbsp; Dear Bertha, leave me, and compose
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Truly, during that evening Bertha was the agitated one, her
speech much affected, and her gestures restless, while
Ph&oelig;be sat over her work, her needle going swiftly and
evenly, and her eyes beaming with her quiet depth of thankful
bliss.</p>
<p>In the morning, again, it was Bertha who betrayed an uneasy
restlessness, and irrepressible desire to banish Miss Fennimore
and Maria from the drawing-room, till the governess, in
perplexity, began to think of consulting Ph&oelig;be whether a
Jack Hastings affair could be coming over again.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be simply trusted to the promise, and went about her
morning&rsquo;s avocations with a heart at rest, and when at last
Humfrey Randolf did hurry in for a few moments, before he must
rush back to the Holt, her greeting was so full of reliance and
composure that Miss Fennimore perceived nothing.&nbsp; Bertha,
however, rested not.&nbsp; As well as she could, under a fearful
access of stammering, she insisted that Mr. Randolf should come
into the dining-room to look at
a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well!&rsquo; thought Miss Fennimore,
&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be is gone, too, so she will keep
guard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Miss Fennimore could have looked through the door, she
would have seen the astonished Maria pounced upon, as if in
sport, pulled up-stairs, and desired by Bertha to find her book
of dried flowers to show Mr. Randolf.&nbsp; Naughty Bertha, who
really did not believe the dried flowers had ever been brought
home from Woolstone-lane!&nbsp; It served the man&oelig;uvrer
right, that Maria, after one look at the shelves, began to cry
out for <!-- page 536--><a name="page536"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 536</span>Ph&oelig;be to come and find
them.&nbsp; But it signified the less since the lovers had not
left the hall, and had exchanged all the words that there was
time for before Bertha, at the sound of the re-opening door, flew
down to put her hand into Humfrey&rsquo;s and grasp it tightly,
looking in his face instead of speaking.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank
you,&rsquo; he said, returning the pressure, and was gone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We improve as we go on.&nbsp; Number three is the best of
my brothers-in-law, Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said Bertha,
lightly.&nbsp; Then leaving Ph&oelig;be to pacify Maria about the
flowers, she went into her own room, and cried bitterly and
overpoweringly.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XXXI</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Thekla</i>.&nbsp; I should love thee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whate&rsquo;er thou hadst chosen,
thou wouldst still have acted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobly and worthy of thee; but
repentance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall ne&rsquo;er disturb thy
soul&rsquo;s fair peace.</p>
<p><i>Max</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I must leave thee;
must part from thee!</p>

<p><i>Thekla</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being faithful<br />
To thine own self, thou art faithful too to
me.&mdash;<i>Wallenstein</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ph&oelig;be and Maria went alone to the Park to receive the
bridal pair, for poor Bertha was so nervous and unhinged as not
even to wish to leave the fireside.&nbsp; It was plain that she
must not be deprived of an elder sister&rsquo;s care, and that it
would be unlikely that she would ever have nerve enough to
undertake the charge of Maria, even if Ph&oelig;be could think of
shifting the responsibility, or if a feeble intellect could be
expected to yield the same deference to a younger sister as came
naturally to an elder one.</p>
<p>Thus Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart was somewhat heavy as she
braced herself for her communication to Mervyn, doubtful as to
the extent of his probable displeasure, but for that very cause
resolved on dealing openly from the first, while satisfied that,
at her age, his right was rather to deference than to surrender
of judgment.&nbsp; Maria roamed through the house, exclaiming at
the alterations, and Ph&oelig;be sat still in the concentrated,
resolute stillness that was her form of suspense.</p>
<p>They came!&nbsp; The peals of the Hiltonbury bells rung
merrily in the cold air, the snow sparkled bridally, the icicles
glittered in the sunset light, the workpeople stood round the
house to cheer the arrival, and the sisters hurried out.</p>
<p>It was no more the pale, patient face!&nbsp; The cheeks were
rounded, the brown eyes smiled, the haggard air, that even as a
bride Cecily had worn, was entirely gone, and Mervyn watched
exultingly Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s surprise at what he had made of
the wan, worn girl they had met at Hy&egrave;res.&nbsp; The only
disappointment was Bertha&rsquo;s absence, and there was much
regret that the new-comers had not heard of her cold so as to
have seen her at the Underwood on their way.&nbsp; They had spent
the previous day in town in going over the distillery, by <!--
page 537--><a name="page537"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
537</span>Cecily&rsquo;s particular wish, and had afterwards
assisted at a grand impromptu entertainment of all the
workpeople, at their own expense and Robert&rsquo;s
trouble.&nbsp; Mervyn did certainly seem carried out of his own
knowledge of himself, and his wife had transgressed every
precedent left by his mother, who had never beheld Whittingtonia
in her life!</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be found their eager talk so mazy and indistinct to
her perception that she became resolved to speak and clear her
mind at the first opportunity; so she tarried behind, when Cecily
went up, under Maria&rsquo;s delighted guidance, to take off her
bonnet, and accosted Mervyn with the ominous words, &lsquo;I want
to speak to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make haste, then; there is Cecily left to
Maria.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to tell you that I am engaged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The deuce you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Mr. Randolf, Miss Charlecote&rsquo;s Canadian
cousin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn, who had expected no less than John Raymond, whirled
round in indignant surprise, and looked incredulously at her, but
was confronted by her two open, unabashed eyes, as she stood firm
on both her feet, and continued: &lsquo;I have been thrown a good
deal with him, so as to learn his goodness and superiority.&nbsp;
I know you will think it a very bad match, for he has nothing but
his hands and head; but we mean to wait till he can offer what
are considered as equal terms.&nbsp; We thought it right you
should know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, that&rsquo;s a clever fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be knew very well that this was ironical, but would
not so reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has abilities,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and we are ready to wait till he has made proof of
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what now?&rsquo; he cried in despair.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I <i>did</i> think you the sensible one of the
lot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you know him,&rsquo; she said, with her fearless
smile, &lsquo;you will own that I <i>was</i> sensible
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, the child looks so complacent that she would
outface me that this mad notion was a fine thing!&nbsp; I declare
it is worse than Bertha&rsquo;s business; and you so much
older!&nbsp; At least Hastings was a man of family, and this is a
Yankee adventurer picked out of the back of a ditch by that young
dog, Sandbrook.&nbsp; Only a Yankee could have had the
impudence!&nbsp; I declare you are laughing all the time.&nbsp;
What have you to say for yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His father was major in the ---th dragoons, and was one
of the Randolfs of&nbsp; ---shire.&nbsp; His mother was a
Charlecote.&nbsp; His birth is as good as our own, and you saw
that he is a gentleman.&nbsp; His character and talents have
gained his present situation, and it is a profession that gives
every opening for ability; nor does he ask for me till his
fortune is made.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But hinders you from doing better!&nbsp; Pray, what
would Augusta say to you?&rsquo; he added, jocosely, for even
while lashing himself up, his tone had been placable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall satisfy her.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 538--><a name="page538"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
538</span>&lsquo;How long has this been going on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We only spoke of it yesterday.&nbsp; Bertha found it
out; but I wish no one else to know it except Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somehow she looks so cool, and she is so entirely the
last girl I expected to go crazy, that I can&rsquo;t laugh at the
thing as I ought!&nbsp; I say, what&rsquo;s this about Miss
Charlecote; will she do anything for him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pray who vouches for his antecedents, such as they
are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Currie and Owen Sandbrook both know the
whole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Sandbrook at the Holt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Ph&oelig;be, suppressing her
strong distaste against bringing him into the affair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall make inquiries, and&mdash;and&mdash;it is
a horrid unlucky business, and the old girl should be scarified
for putting you in his way.&nbsp; The end will be that
you&rsquo;ll marry on your own means, and be pinched for
life.&nbsp; Now, look here, you are no fool at the bottom; you
will give it up if I find that he is no go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be proved that I ought,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;And if you find him what I have told
you, you will make no opposition.&nbsp; Thank you,
Mervyn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said he, laughing, and letting her kiss
him, &lsquo;I have made no promises, mind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The confidence that Ph&oelig;be had earned had stood her in
good stead.&nbsp; Mervyn had great trust in her judgment, and was
too happy besides for severity on other people&rsquo;s
love.&nbsp; Nor were her perfect openness, and fearless though
modest independence, without effect.&nbsp; She was not one who
invited tyranny, but truly &lsquo;queen o&rsquo;er
herself,&rsquo; she ruled herself too well to leave the reins
loose for others to seize.</p>
<p>The result of the interview had surpassed her hopes, and she
had nothing to regret but her brother&rsquo;s implied purpose of
consulting Owen Sandbrook.&nbsp; Friend of Humfrey though he
were, she could not feel secure of his generosity, and wished the
engineer had been the nearer referee; but she did not say so, as
much for shame at her own uncharitableness, as for fear of
rousing Mervyn&rsquo;s distrust; and she was afraid that her
injunctions to secrecy would be disregarded.&nbsp; Fully aware
that all would be in common between the husband and wife, she was
still taken by surprise when Cecily, coming early next day to the
Underwood to see Bertha, took her aside to say, &lsquo;Dearest, I
hope this is all right, and for your happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will soon know that it is,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
brightly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only, my dear, it must not be a long engagement.&nbsp;
Ah! you think that nothing now, but I could not bear to think
that <i>you</i> were to go through a long attachment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was this forgiving Cecily really fancying that her sorrows had
been nothing worse than those incidental to a long
attachment?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;if she could
ever have felt the full <!-- page 539--><a
name="page539"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 539</span>reliance on
which I can venture, she need never have drooped!&nbsp; What is
time to trust?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn kept his word, and waiving ceremony, took his wife at
once to the Holt, and leaving her with Miss Charlecote, made a
visit to Owen in the study, wishing, in the first place, to
satisfy himself of the young man&rsquo;s competence to reply to
his questions.&nbsp; On this he had no doubt; Owen had made
steady progress ever since he had been in England, and especially
during the quiet time that had succeeded his sister&rsquo;s
marriage.&nbsp; His mental powers had fully regained their
keenness and balance, and though still incapable of sustained
exertion of his faculties, he could talk as well as ever, and the
first ten minutes convinced Mervyn that he was conversing with a
shrewd sensible observer, who had seen a good deal of life, and
of the world.&nbsp; He then led to the question about young
Randolf, endeavouring so to frame it as not to betray the
occasion of it.</p>
<p>The reply fully confirmed all that Ph&oelig;be had
averred.&nbsp; The single efforts of a mere youth, not eighteen
at the time of his father&rsquo;s failure, without capital, and
set down in a wild uncleared part of the bush, had of course been
inadequate to retrieve the ruined fortunes of the family; but he
had shown wonderful spirit, patience, and perseverance, and the
duteous temper in which he had borne the sacrifice of his
prospects by his father&rsquo;s foolish speculations and
unsuitable marriage, his affectionate treatment of the wife and
children when left on his hands, and his cheerful endurance of
the severest and most hopeless drudgery for the bare support of
life, had all been such as to inspire the utmost confidence in
his character.&nbsp; Of his future prospects, Owen spoke with a
sigh almost of envy.&nbsp; His talent and industry had already
made him a valuable assistant to Mr. Currie, and an able engineer
had an almost certain career of prosperity open to him.&nbsp;
Lastly Mervyn asked what was the connection with Miss Charlecote,
and what possibilities it held out.&nbsp; Owen winced for a
moment, then explained the second cousinship, adding, however,
that there was no entail, that the disposal of Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s property was entirely in her own power, and
that she had manifested no intention of treating the young man
with more than ordinary civility, in fact that she had rather
shrunk from acknowledging his likeness to the family.&nbsp; His
father&rsquo;s English relatives had, in like manner, owned him
as a kinsman; but had shown no alacrity in making friends with
him.&nbsp; The only way to be noticed, as the two gentlemen
agreed, when glad to close their conference in a laugh, is to
need no notice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncommon hard on a fellow,&rsquo; soliloquized Owen,
when left alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it not enough to have
one&rsquo;s throat cut, but must one do it with one&rsquo;s own
hands?&nbsp; It is a fine thing to be magnanimous when one thinks
one is going off the stage, but quite another thing when one is
to remain there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no twelfth century saint, only a
nineteenth century beggar, with an unlucky child on my
hands!&nbsp; Am I to give away girl, land, and all to <!-- page
540--><a name="page540"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
540</span>the fellow I raked out of his swamps?&nbsp; Better have
let him grill and saved my limbs!&nbsp; And pray what more am I
to do?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve introduced him, made no secret of his
parentage, puffed him off, and brought him here, and pretty good
care he takes of himself!&nbsp; Am I to pester poor Honey if she
does prefer the child she bred up to a stranger?&nbsp; No, no,
I&rsquo;ve done my part: let him look out for himself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn allowed to Ph&oelig;be that Randolf was no impostor,
but warned her against assuming his consent.&nbsp; She suspected
that Owen at least guessed the cause of these inquiries, and it
kept her aloof from the Holt.&nbsp; When Miss Charlecote spoke of
poor Owen&rsquo;s want of spirits, discretion told her that she
was not the person to enliven him; and the consciousness of her
secret made her less desirous of confidences with her kind old
friend, so that her good offices chiefly consisted in having
little Owen to the Underwood to play with Maria, who delighted in
his society, and unconsciously did much for his improvement.</p>
<p>Honor herself perceived that Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s visits only
saddened her convalescent, and that in his present state he was
happiest with no one but her, who was more than ever a mother to
him.&nbsp; They were perfectly at ease together, as she amused
him with the familiar books, which did not strain his powers like
new ones, the quiet household talk, the little playful exchanges
of tender wit, and the fresh arrangement of all her museum on the
natural system, he having all the entertainment, and she all the
trouble, till her conversion astonished Bertha.&nbsp; The old
religious habits of the Holt likewise seemed to soothe and give
him pleasure; but whether by force of old association, or from
their hold on his heart, was as yet unknown to Honora, and
perhaps to himself.&nbsp; It was as if he were deferring all
demonstration till he should be able again to examine the subject
with concentrated attention.&nbsp; Or it might be that, while he
shrank from exerting himself upon Randolf&rsquo;s behalf, he was
not ready for repentance, and therefore distrusted, and hung back
from, the impulses that would otherwise have drawn him to renew
all that he had once cast aside.&nbsp; He was never left alone
without becoming deeply melancholy, yet no companionship save
Honor&rsquo;s seemed to suit him for many minutes together.&nbsp;
His brain was fast recovering the injury, but it was a trying
convalescence; and with returning health, his perfect
helplessness fretted him under all the difficulties of so tall
and heavy a man being carried from bed to sofa, from sofa to
carriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Owen!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be to herself, one day
when she had not been able to avoid witnessing this pitiable
spectacle of infirmity; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think why I am
always fancying he is doing Humfrey and me some injustice, and
that he knows it.&nbsp; He, who brought Humfrey home, and has
praised him to Mervyn!&nbsp; It is very uncharitable of me, but
why will he look at me as if he were asking my pardon?&nbsp;
Well, we shall see the result of Mervyn&rsquo;s
inspection!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 541--><a name="page541"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
541</span>Mervyn and his wife were going for two nights to the
rooms at the office, in the first lull of the bridal invitations,
which were infinitely more awful to Cecily than to
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; After twenty-nine years of quiet clerical
life, Cecily neither understood nor liked the gaieties even of
the county, had very little to say, and, unless her aunt were
present, made Ph&oelig;be into a protector, and retired behind
her, till Ph&oelig;be sometimes feared that Mervyn would be quite
provoked, and remember his old dread lest Cecily should be too
homely and bashful for her position.&nbsp; Poor dear
Cecily!&nbsp; She was as good and kind as possible; but in the
present close intercourse it sometimes would suggest to
Ph&oelig;be, &lsquo;was she quite as wise as she was
good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Fennimore, with still clearer eyes, inwardly decided
that, though religion should above all form the morals, yet the
morality of common sense and judgment should be cultivated with
an equal growth.</p>
<p>Cecily returned from London radiant with sisterly
congratulation, in a flutter of delight with Mr. Randolf, and
intimating a glorious project in the background, devised between
herself and Mervyn, then guarding against possible disappointment
by declaring it might be all her own fancy.</p>
<p>The meaning of these prognostics appeared the next
morning.&nbsp; Mervyn had been much impressed by Humfrey
Randolf&rsquo;s keen business-like appearance and sensible
conversation, as well as by Mr. Currie&rsquo;s opinion of him;
and, always detesting the trouble of his own distillery, it had
occurred to him that to secure an active working partner, and
throw his sister&rsquo;s fortune into the business, would be a
most convenient, generous, and brotherly means of smoothing the
course of true love; and Cecily had been so enchanted at the
happiness he would thus confer, that he came to the Underwood
quite elevated with his own kindness.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be heard his offer with warm thankfulness, but could
not answer for Humfrey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has too much sense not to take a good offer,&rsquo;
said Mervyn, &lsquo;otherwise, it is all humbug his pretending to
care for you.&nbsp; As to Robert&rsquo;s folly, have not I given
up all that any rational being could stick at?&nbsp; I tell you,
it is the giving up those houses that makes me in want of
capital, so you are bound to make it up to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn and Ph&oelig;be wrote by the same post.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
will be satisfied with whatever you decide upon as right,&rsquo;
were Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s words; but she refrained from expressing
any wish.&nbsp; What was the use of a wise man, if he were not to
be let alone to make up his mind?&nbsp; She would trust to him to
divine what it would be to her to be thus one with her own
family, and to gain him without losing her sisters.&nbsp; The
balance must not be weighted by a woman&rsquo;s hand, when ready
enough to incline to her side; and why should she add to his
pain, if he must refuse?</p>
<p>How ardently she wished, however, can be imagined.&nbsp; She
<!-- page 542--><a name="page542"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
542</span>could not hide from herself pictures of herself and
Humfrey, sometimes in London, sometimes at the Underwood, working
with Robert, and carrying out the projects which Mervyn but half
acted on, and a quarter understood.</p>
<p>The letter came, and the first line was decisive.&nbsp; In
spite of earnest wishes and great regrets, Humfrey could not
reconcile the trade to his sense of right.&nbsp; He knew that as
Mervyn conducted it, it was as unobjectionable as was possible,
and that the works were admirably regulated; but it was in going
over the distillery as a curiosity he had seen enough to perceive
that it was a line in which enterprise and exertion could only
find scope by extending the demoralizing sale of spirits, and he
trusted to Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s agreeing with him, that when he
already had a profession fairly free from temptation, it was his
duty not to put himself into one that might prove more full of
danger to him than to one who had been always used to it.&nbsp;
He had not consulted Robert, feeling clear in his own mind, and
thinking that he had probably rather not interfere.</p>
<p>Kind Humfrey!&nbsp; That bit of consideration filled
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s heart with grateful relief.&nbsp; It gave her
spirits to be comforted by the tender and cheering words with
which the edge of the disappointment was softened, and herself
thanked for her abstinence from persuasion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
better to wait seven years, with such a Humfrey as this in
reserve, than to let him warp aside one inch of his sense of
duty!&nbsp; As high-minded as dear Robert, without his ruggedness
and harshness,&rsquo; she thought as she read the manly,
warm-hearted letter to Mervyn, which he had enclosed, and which
she could not help showing to Bertha.</p>
<p>It was lost on Bertha.&nbsp; She thought it dull and
poor-spirited not to accept, and manage the distillery just as he
pleased.&nbsp; Any one could manage Mervyn, she said, not
estimating the difference between a petted sister and a junior
partner, and it was a new light to her that the
trade&mdash;involving so much chemistry and mechanic
ingenuity&mdash;was not good enough for anybody, unless they were
peacocks too stupid to appreciate the dignity of labour!&nbsp;
For the first time Ph&oelig;be wished her secret known to Miss
Charlecote, for the sake of her appreciation of his triumph of
principle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Robert&rsquo;s doing!&rsquo; was Mervyn&rsquo;s
first exclamation, when Ph&oelig;be gave him the letter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If there be an intolerable plague in the world, it is the
having a fanatical fellow like that in the family.&nbsp; Nice
requital for all I have thrown away for the sake of his
maggots!&nbsp; I declare I&rsquo;ll resume every house I&rsquo;ve
let him have for his tomfooleries, and have a gin bottle blown as
big as an ox as a sign for each of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be had a certain lurking satisfaction in observing,
when his malediction had run itself down, &lsquo;He never
consulted Robert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that!&nbsp; As if Robert had not
run about with his mouth open, reviling his father&rsquo;s trade,
and pluming himself on keeping out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 543--><a name="page543"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
543</span>&lsquo;Mervyn, you know better!&nbsp; Robert had said
no word against you!&nbsp; It is the facts that speak for
themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The facts?&nbsp; You little simpleton, do you imagine
that we distil the juices of little babies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be laughed, and he added kindly, &lsquo;Come, little
one, I know this is no doing of yours.&nbsp; You have stuck by
this wicked distiller of vile liquids through thick and
thin.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let the parson lead you nor Randolf by
the nose; he is far too fine a fellow for that; but come up to
town with me and Cecily, as soon as Lady Caroline&rsquo;s bear
fight is over, and make him hear reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be very glad to go and see him, but I cannot
persuade him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When a man has made up his mind, it would be wrong to
try to over-persuade him, even if I believed that I
could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know the alternative?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just breaking with him a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall see what Crabbe, and Augusta, and Acton will
say to your taking up with a dumpy leveller.&nbsp; We shall have
another row.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll be broken up
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was by far the most alarming of his threats; but she did
not greatly believe that he would bring it to pass, or that an
engagement, however imprudent, conducted as hers had been, could
be made a plea for accusing Miss Fennimore or depriving her of
her sisters.&nbsp; She tried to express her thankfulness for the
kindness that had prompted the original proposal, and her
sympathy with his natural vexation at finding that a traffic
which he had really ameliorated at considerable loss of profit,
was still considered objectionable; but he silenced this at once
as palaver, and went off to fetch his wife to try her
arguments.</p>
<p>This was worse than Ph&oelig;be had expected!&nbsp; Cecily was
too thorough a wife not to have adopted all her husband&rsquo;s
interests, and had totally forgotten all the objections current
in her own family against the manufacture of spirits.&nbsp; She
knew that great opportunities of gain had been yielded up, and
such improvements made as had converted the distillery into a
model of its kind; she was very proud of it, wished every one to
be happy, and Mervyn to be saved trouble, and thought the
scruples injurious and overstrained.&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be would not
contest them with her.&nbsp; What the daughter had learnt by
degrees, might not be forced on the wife; and Ph&oelig;be would
only protest against trying to shake a fixed purpose, instead of
maintaining its grounds.&nbsp; So Cecily continued affectionately
hurt, and unnecessarily compassionate, showing that a woman can
hardly marry a person of tone inferior to her own without some
deterioration of judgment, beneficial and elevating as her
influence may be in the main.</p>
<p><!-- page 544--><a name="page544"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
544</span>Poor Cecily! she did the very thing that those
acquainted with the ins and outs of the family had most
deprecated!&nbsp; She dragged Robert into the affair, writing a
letter, very pretty in wifely and sisterly goodwill, to entreat
him to take Mr. Randolf in hand, and persuade him of the
desirableness of the spirit manufacture in general, and that of
the Fulmort house in particular.</p>
<p>The letter she received in return was intended to be very
kind, but was severely grave, in simply observing that what he
had not thought fit to do himself, he could not persuade another
to do.</p>
<p>Those words somehow acted upon Mervyn as bitter and ungrateful
irony; and working himself up by an account, in his own
colouring, of Robert&rsquo;s behaviour at the time of the
foundation of St. Matthew&rsquo;s, he went thundering off to
assure Ph&oelig;be that he <i>must</i> take an active partner, at
all events; and that if she and Robert did not look out, he
should find a moneyed man who knew what he was about, would clear
off Robert&rsquo;s waste, and restore the place to what it had
once been.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your letter, Ph&oelig;be?&rsquo; he asked,
seeing an envelope in Robert&rsquo;s handwriting on her
table.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be coloured a little.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has not said
one word to Humfrey,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what has he said to you?&nbsp; The traitor,
insulting me to my wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be thought for one second, then resolved to take the
risk of reading all aloud, considering that whatever might be the
effect, it could not be worse than that of his surmises.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cecily has written to me, greatly to my surprise,
begging for my influence with Randolf to induce him to become
partner in the house.&nbsp; I understand by this that he has
already refused, and that you are aware of his determination;
therefore I have no scruple in writing to tell you that he is
perfectly right.&nbsp; It is true that the trade, as Mervyn
conducts it, is free from the most flagrant evils that deterred
me from taking a share in it; and I am most thankful for the
changes he has made.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You show it, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; interjected
Mervyn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather see it in his hands than those of any
other person, and there is nothing blameworthy in his continuance
in it.&nbsp; But it is of questionable expedience, and there are
still hereditary practices carried on, the harm of which he has
not hitherto perceived, but which would assuredly shock a
new-comer such as Randolf.&nbsp; You can guess what would be the
difficulty of obtaining alteration, and acquiescence would be
even more fatal.&nbsp; I do not tell you this as complaining of
Mervyn, who has done and is doing infinite good, but to warn you
against the least endeavour to influence Randolf.&nbsp; Depend
upon it, even the accelerating your marriage would not secure
your happiness if you saw your husband and brother at continual
variance in the details of the business, and opposition might at
any moment lead Mervyn to undo all the good he has
effected.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 545--><a name="page545"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
545</span>&lsquo;Right enough there;&rsquo; and Mervyn, who had
looked furious at several sentences, laughed at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must get another partner, then, who can and will manage;
and when all the gin-palaces are more splendiferous than ever,
what will you and the parson say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That to do a little wrong in hopes of hindering another
from doing worse, never yet succeeded!&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
bravely.</p>
<p>She saw that the worst was over when he had come to that
laugh, and that the danger of a quarrel between the brothers was
averted.&nbsp; She did not know from how much terror and
self-reproach poor Cecily was suffering, nor her multitudinous
resolutions against kindly interferences upon <i>terra
incognita</i>.</p>
<p>That fit of wrath subsided, and Mervyn neither looked out for
his moneyed partner, nor fulfilled his threat of bringing the
united forces of the family displeasure upon his sister.&nbsp;
Still there was a cloud overshadowing the enjoyment, though not
lessening the outward harmony of those early bridal days.&nbsp;
The long, dark drives to the county gaieties, shut up with Mervyn
and Cecily, were formidable by the mere existence of a topic,
never mentioned, but always secretly dwelt on.&nbsp; And in spite
of three letters a week, Ph&oelig;be was beginning to learn that
trust does not fully make up to the heart for absence, by the
distance of London to estimate that of Canada, and by the
weariness of one month, the tedium of seven years!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said Bertha to Cecily, &lsquo;Ph&oelig;be
is so stupidly like herself now she is engaged, that it is no fun
at all.&nbsp; Nobody would guess her to be in love!&nbsp; If they
cared for each other one rush, would not they have floated to
bliss even on streams of gin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cecily would not dispute their mutual love, but she was not
one of those who could fully understand the double force of that
love which is second to love of principle.&nbsp; Obedience, not
judgment, had been her safeguard, and, like most women, she was
carried along, not by the abstract idea, but by its upholder.</p>
<p>Intuition, rather than what had actually passed before her,
showed Ph&oelig;be more than once that Cecily was sorely
perplexed by the difference between the standard of Sutton and
that of Beauchamp.&nbsp; Strict, scrupulous, and deeply devout,
the clergyman&rsquo;s daughter suffered at every deviation from
the practices of the parsonage, made her stand in the wrong
places, and while conscientiously and painfully fretting Mervyn
about petty details, would be unknowingly carried over far
greater stumbling-blocks.&nbsp; In her ignorance she would be
distressed at habits which were comparatively innocent, and then
fear to put forth her influence at the right moment.&nbsp; There
was hearty affection on either side, and Mervyn was exceedingly
improved, but more than once Ph&oelig;be saw in poor
Cecily&rsquo;s harassed, puzzled, wistful face, and heard in her
faltering remonstrances, what it was to have loved and married
without perfect esteem and trust.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Master Howen, Master Howen, you must not go up the best
stairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I will go up the best stairs.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like the nasty, dark, back stairs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me take off your boots then, sir; Mrs. Stubbs said
she could not have such dirty marks&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for Mrs. Stubbs!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
take my boots off!&nbsp; Get off&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kick you if you
touch them!&nbsp; I shall go where I like!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a
gentleman.&nbsp; I shall ave hall the Olt for my very
hown!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master Howen!&nbsp; Oh my!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Flibbertigibbet&rsquo;s teeth were in the crack
orphan&rsquo;s neck, and the foot that she had not seized kicking
like a vicious colt, when a large hand seized him by the collar,
and lifted him in mid-air; and the crack orphan, looking up as
though the oft-invoked &lsquo;ugly man&rsquo; of her infancy had
really come to bear off naughty children, beheld for a moment,
propped against the door-post, the tall figure and bearded head
hitherto only seen on the sofa.</p>
<p>The next instant the child had been swung into the study, and
the apparition, stumbling with one hand and foot to the couch,
said breathlessly to the frightened girl, &lsquo;I am sorry for
my little boy&rsquo;s shameful behaviour!&nbsp; Leave him
here.&nbsp; Owen, stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The child was indeed standing, as if powerless to move or even
to cry, stunned by his flight in the air, and dismayed at the
terrific presence in which he was for the first time left
alone.&nbsp; Completely roused and excited, the elder Owen sat
upright, speaking not loud, but in tones forcible from vehement
feeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen, you boast of being a gentleman!&nbsp; Do you know
what we are?&nbsp; We are beggars!&nbsp; I can neither work for
myself nor for you.&nbsp; We live on charity.&nbsp; That girl
earns her bread&mdash;we do not!&nbsp; We are beggars!&nbsp; Who
told you otherwise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of an answer, he only evoked a passion of frightened
tears, so piteous, that he spoke more gently, and stretched out
his hand; but his son shook his frock at him in terror, and
retreated out of reach, backwards into a corner, replying to his
calls and assurances with violent sobs, and broken entreaties to
go back to &lsquo;granma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At last, in despair, Owen lowered himself to the floor, and
made the whole length of his person available; but the child, in
the extremity of terror at the giant crawling after him, shrieked
wildly and made a rush at the door, but was caught and at once
drawn within the grasp of the sweeping arm.</p>
<p><!-- page 547--><a name="page547"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
547</span>All was still.&nbsp; He was gathered up to the broad
breast; the hairy cheek was gently pressed against his wet
one.&nbsp; It was a great powerful, encircling caress that held
him.&nbsp; There was a strange thrill in this contact between the
father and son&mdash;a new sensation of intense loving pity in
the one, a great but soothing awe in the other, as struggling and
crying no more, he clung ever closer and closer, and drew the arm
tighter round him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor little fellow!&rsquo;&nbsp; And never had there
been such sweetness in those deep full tones.</p>
<p>The boy responded with both arms round his neck, and face laid
on his shoulder.&nbsp; Poor child! it was the affection that his
little heart had hungered for ever since he had left his
grandmother, and which he had inspired in no one.</p>
<p>A few more seconds, and he was sitting on the floor, resting
against his father, listening without alarm to his
question&mdash;&lsquo;Now, Owen, what were you saying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never do it again,
pa&mdash;never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, never be disobedient, nor fight with girls.&nbsp;
But what were you saying about the Holt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall live here&mdash;I shall have it for my
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who told you so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Granma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Grandmamma knows nothing about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shan&rsquo;t I, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&nbsp; Listen, Owen.&nbsp; This is Miss
Charlecote&rsquo;s house as long as she lives&mdash;I trust till
long after you are a man.&nbsp; It will be Mr. Randolf&rsquo;s
afterwards, and neither you nor I have anything to do with
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two great black eyes looked up in inquiring, disappointed
intelligence.&nbsp; Then he said, in a satisfied tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t beggars&mdash;we don&rsquo;t carry
rabbit-skins and lucifers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We do nothing so useful or profitable,&rsquo; sighed
poor Owen, striving to pull himself up by the table, but
desisting on finding that it was more likely to overbalance than
to be a support.&nbsp; &lsquo;My poor boy, you will have to work
for me!&rsquo; and he sadly stroked down the light hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I?&rsquo; said the little fellow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;May I have some white mice?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bring you all
the halfpence, pa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring me a footstool, first of all.&nbsp;
There&mdash;at this rate I shall be able to hop about on one leg,
and be a more taking spectacle,&rsquo; said Owen, as, dragging
himself up by the force of hand and arm, he resettled himself on
his couch, as much pleased as amazed at his first personal act of
locomotion after seven months, and at the discovery of recovered
strength in the sound limbs.&nbsp; Although, with the reserve of
convalescence, he kept his exploit secret, his spirits visibly
rose; and whenever he was left alone, or only with his little
boy, he repeated his experiments, launching himself from one
piece of furniture to another; and in spite of the continued
deadness of the left side, feeling life, vigour, and hope
returning on him.</p>
<p><!-- page 548--><a name="page548"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
548</span>His morbid shyness of his child had given way to
genuine affection, and Owen soon found that he liked to be left
to the society of Flibbertigibbet, or as he called him for short,
Giblets, exacting in return the title of father, instead of the
terrible &lsquo;pa.&rsquo;&nbsp; Little Owen thought this a
preparation for the itinerant white-mouse exhibition, which he
was permitted to believe was only delayed till the daily
gymnastic exertions should have resulted in the use of crutches,
and till he could safely pronounce the names of the future mice,
Hannibal and Annabella, and other traps for aspirates!&nbsp; Nay,
his father was going to set up an exhibition of his own, as it
appeared; for after a vast amount of meditation, he begged for
pen and paper, ruler and compasses, drew, wrote, and figured, and
finally took to cardboard and penknife, begging the aid of Miss
Charlecote, greatly to the distress of the little boy, who had
thought the whole affair private and confidential, and looked
forward to a secret departure early in the morning, with
crutches, mice, and model.</p>
<p>Miss Charlecote did her best with needle and gum, but could
not understand; and between her fears of trying Owen&rsquo;s
patience and letting him overstrain his brain, was so much
distressed that he gave it up; but it preyed on him, till one day
Ph&oelig;be came in, and he could not help explaining it to her,
and claiming her assistance, as he saw her ready
comprehension.&nbsp; For two afternoons she came and worked under
him; and between card, wire, gum, and watch-spring, such a
beauteous little model locomotive engine and train were produced,
that Owen archly assured her that &lsquo;she would be a fortune
in herself to a rising engineer,&rsquo; and Honor was struck by
the sudden crimson evoked by the compliment.</p>
<p>Little Owen thought their fortune made, and was rather
disappointed at the delay, when his father, confirming his idea
that their livelihood might depend on the model, insisted that it
should be carried out in brass and wood, and caused his chair to
be frequently wheeled down to the blacksmith&rsquo;s and
carpenter&rsquo;s, whose comprehension so much more resembled
their lady&rsquo;s than that of Miss Fulmort, and who made such
intolerable blunders, that he bestowed on them more vituperation
than, in their opinion, &lsquo;he had any call to;&rsquo; and
looked in a passion of despair at the numb, nerveless fingers,
once his dexterous servants.</p>
<p>Still his spirits were immensely improved, since resolution,
hope, and independence had returned.&nbsp; His mental faculties
had recovered their force, and with the removal of the disease,
the healthfulness and elasticity of his twenty-five years were
beginning to compensate for the lost powers of his limbs.&nbsp;
As he accomplished more, he grew more enterprising and less
disinclined to show off his recovered powers.&nbsp; He first
alarmed, then delighted Honor; begged for crutches, and made such
good use of them, that Dr. Martin held out fair hopes of
progress, though advising a course of rubbing and sea-air at
Brighton.</p>
<p><!-- page 549--><a name="page549"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
549</span>Perhaps Honor had never been happier than during these
weeks of improvement, with her boy so completely her own, and
more than she had ever known him; his dejection lessening, his
health returning, his playfulness brilliant, his filial fondness
most engaging.&nbsp; She did not know the fixed resolution that
actuated him, and revived the entire man!&nbsp; She did not know
what was kept in reserve till confidence in his efficiency should
dispose her to listen favourably.&nbsp; Meantime the present was
so delightful to her that she trembled and watched lest she
should be relapsing into the old idolatry.&nbsp; The test would
be whether she would put Owen above or below a clear duty.</p>
<p>The audit of farm-accounts before going to Brighton was as
unsatisfactory as the last.&nbsp; Though not beyond her own
powers of unravelling, they made it clear that Brooks was
superannuated.&nbsp; It was piteous to see the old man seated in
the study, racking his brains to recollect the transaction with
Farmer Hodnet about seed-wheat and working oxen; to explain for
what the three extra labourers had been put on, and to discover
his own meaning in charging twice over for the repairs of Joe
Littledale&rsquo;s cottage; angered and overset by his
mistress&rsquo;s gentle cross-examination, and enraged into
absolute disrespect when that old object of dislike, Mr.
Sandbrook, looked over the books, and muttered suggestions under
his moustache.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old man!&rsquo; both exclaimed, as he left the
room, and Honor sighed deeply over this failure of the last of
the supports left her by Humfrey.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must pension him
off,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope it will not hurt his
feelings much!&rsquo; and then she turned away to her
old-fashioned bureau, and applied herself to her entries in her
farming-books, while Owen sat in his chair, dreamily caressing
his beard, and revolving the proposition that had long been in
his mind.</p>
<p>At last the tall, red book was shut, the pen wiped, the bureau
locked, and Honor came back to her place by the table, and
resumed her needlework.&nbsp; Still there was silence, till she
began: &lsquo;This settles it!&nbsp; I have been thinking about
it ever since you have been so much better.&nbsp; Owen, what
should you think of managing the property for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He only answered by a quick interrogative glance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;by the help of
Brooks, who knew his master&rsquo;s ways, I have pottered on, to
my own wonderment; but Brooks is past work, my downhill-time is
coming, high farming has outrun us both, and I know that we are
not doing as Humfrey would wish by his inheritance.&nbsp; Now I
believe that nothing could be of greater use to me, the people,
or the place, than that you should be in charge.&nbsp; We could
put some deputy under your control, and contrive for your getting
about the fields.&nbsp; I would give you so much a year, so that
your boy&rsquo;s education would be your own doing, and we should
be <i>so</i> comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen leant back, much moved, smiled and said, &lsquo;Thanks,
dear Honor; you are much too good to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 550--><a name="page550"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
550</span>&lsquo;Think about it, and tell me what would be
right.&nbsp; Brooks has &pound;100 a year, but you will be worth
much more, for you will develop all the resources, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Best Honor, Sweetest Honey,&rsquo; said Owen, hastily,
the tears rising to his eyes, &lsquo;I cannot bear to frustrate
such kind plans, nor seem more ungrateful than I have been
already.&nbsp; I will not live on you for nothing longer than I
can help; but indeed, this must not be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; There are many reasons against it.&nbsp; In
the first place, I know nothing of farming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would soon learn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And vex your dear old spirit with steam-ploughs and
haymaking machines.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, as if from him she could endure even steam.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next, such an administration would be highly
distasteful here.&nbsp; My overweening airs as a boy have not
been forgotten, and I have always been looked on as an
interloper.&nbsp; Depend on it, poor old Brooks fancies the
muddle in his accounts was a suggestion of my malice!&nbsp;
Imagine the feelings of Hiltonbury, when I, his supplanter, begin
to tighten the reins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be so, it can be got over,&rsquo; said Honor, a
little aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it ought to be attempted,&rsquo; said Owen;
&lsquo;but you have not heard my personal grounds for refusing
your kindness.&nbsp; All your goodness and kind teaching cannot
prevent the undesirableness of letting my child grow up here, in
a half-and-half position, engendering domineering airs and
unreasonable expectations.&nbsp; You know how, in spite of your
care and warnings, it worked on me, though I had more advantages
than that poor little man.&nbsp; Dear Honor, it is not you, but
myself that I blame.&nbsp; You did your utmost to disabuse me,
and it is only the belief that my absurd folly is in human nature
that makes me thus ungracious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Honora, murmuring, as if in shame,
&lsquo;you know you, and therefore your child, must be my
especial charge, and always stand first with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;First in your affection, dearest Honey,&rsquo; he said,
fondly; &lsquo;I trust I have been in that place these twenty
years; I&rsquo;ll never give that up; but if I get as well as I
hope to do, I mean to be no charge on any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot return to your profession?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My riding and surveying days are over, but
there&rsquo;s plenty of work in me still; and I see my way to a
connection that will find me in enough of writing, calculating,
and drawing, to keep myself and Owen, and I expect to make
something of my invention too, when I am settled in
London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; the poor old woman in Whittington-street is
breaking&mdash;pining for her grandchild, I believe, and losing
her lodgers, from not being able to make them comfortable; and
without <!-- page 551--><a name="page551"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 551</span>what she had for the child, she
cannot keep an effective servant.&nbsp; I think of going to help
her out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I do owe her a duty!&nbsp; I robbed her of her
own child, and it is cruel to deprive her of mine when she has
had all the trouble of his babyhood.&nbsp; Money would not do the
thing, even if I had it.&nbsp; I have brought it on myself, and
it is the only atonement in my power; so I mean to occupy two or
three of her rooms, work there, and let her have the satisfaction
of &ldquo;doing for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; When you are in town, I
shall hop into Woolstone-lane.&nbsp; You will give me holidays
here, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; And whenever you want me, let me be
your son?&nbsp; To that you know I reserve my right,&rsquo; and
he bent towards her affectionately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very right&mdash;very noble,&rsquo; she was
faltering forth.&nbsp; He turned quickly, the tears, ready to
fall, springing quite forth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honor! you have not been able to say that since I was a
child!&nbsp; Do not spoil it.&nbsp; If this be right, leave it
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only one thing, Owen, are you sufficiently considering
your son&rsquo;s good in taking him there, out of the way of a
good education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A working education is the good one for him,&rsquo;
said Owen, &lsquo;not the being sent at the cost of
others&mdash;not even covertly at yours, Sweet Honey&mdash;to an
expensive school.&nbsp; He is a working man&rsquo;s son, and must
so feel himself.&nbsp; I mean to face my own penalties in him,
and if I see him in a grade inferior to what was mine by birth, I
shall know that though I brought it on him, it is more for his
real good and happiness to be a man of the people, than a poor
half-acknowledged gentleman.&nbsp; So much for my Americanisms,
Honor!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the dissent&mdash;the cant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so much cant as real piety obtrusively
expressed.&nbsp; Poor old thing!&nbsp; I have no fear but that
little Giblets will go my way! he worships me, and I shall not
leave his <i>h&rsquo;s</i> nor more important matters to her
mercy.&nbsp; He is nearly big enough for the day school Mr.
Parsons is setting on foot.&nbsp; It is a great consideration
that the place is in the St. Matthew&rsquo;s district!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Owen, I cannot but see that it may be your
rightest course; I hope you may find yourself equal to it,&rsquo;
said Honor, struggling with a fresh sense of desertion, though
with admiration and esteem returning, such as were well worth the
disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If not,&rsquo; said Owen, smiling, to hide deeper
feelings, &lsquo;I reserve to you the pleasure of maintaining me,
nursing me, or what not!&nbsp; If my carcase be good for nothing,
I hereby make it over to you.&nbsp; And now, Honor, I have not
been without thought for you.&nbsp; I can tell you of a better
successor for Brooks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; she said, almost crossly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humfrey Charlecote Randolf,&rsquo; said Owen, slowly,
giving full effect to the two Christian names.</p>
<p>Honor started, gasped, and snatching at the first that
occurred <!-- page 552--><a name="page552"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 552</span>of her objections, exclaimed,
&lsquo;But, my dear, he is as much an engineer as
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From necessity, not choice.&nbsp; He farmed till last
August.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Canadian farming!&nbsp; Besides, what nonsense to offer
a young man, with all the world before him, to be bailiff of this
little place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would, were he only to stand in Brooks&rsquo;s
position; but if he were the acknowledged heir, as he ought to
be&mdash;yes, I know I am saying a dreadful thing&mdash;but, my
good Queen Elizabeth, your Grace would be far wiser to accept
Jamie at once than to keep your subjects fretting over your
partialities.&nbsp; He will be a worthy Humfrey Charlecote if you
catch and pin him down young.&nbsp; He will be worthy any way,
but if you let him go levelling and roaming over the world for
the best half of his life, this same Holt will lose its charms
for him and his heirs for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;but how can you tell that he would be caught
and pinned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a very sufficient pin at the
Underwood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Owen, impossible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind, no one has told me in so many words, but Mervyn
Fulmort gave me such an examination on Randolf as men used to do
when matrimony is in the wind; and since that, he inferred the
engagement, when he came to me in no end of a rage, because my
backwoodsman had conscientious scruples against partaking in
their concoction of evil spirits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that Mervyn wants to employ him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To take him into partnership, on the consideration of a
certain thirty thousand.&nbsp; You may judge whence that was to
come!&nbsp; And he, like Robert, declined to live by murdering
bodies and souls.&nbsp; I am afraid Mervyn has been persecuting
them ever since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ever since when?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This last conversation was some three weeks ago.&nbsp;
I suspect the principal parties settled it on that snowy
Twelfth-day&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But which of them, Owen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which?&rsquo; exclaimed Owen, laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The goggle or the squint?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Owen.&nbsp; But I cannot believe that
Ph&oelig;be would not have told me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having a sister like Lady Bannerman may hinder
confidences to friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Owen, are you sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As sure as I was that it was a moonstruck man that
slept in my room in Woolstone-lane.&nbsp; I knew that
Cynthia&rsquo;s darts had been as effective as though he had been
a son of Niobe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it yet,&rsquo; cried Honor;
&lsquo;an honourable man&mdash;a sensible girl!&nbsp; Such a wild
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! Queen Elizabeth!&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth! shut up an
honourable man and a sensible girl in a cedar parlour every
evening <!-- page 553--><a name="page553"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 553</span>for ten days, and then talk of wild
things!&nbsp; Have you forgotten what it is to be under
twenty-five?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate Queen Elizabeth,&rsquo; said Honor, somewhat
tartly.</p>
<p>He muttered something of an apology, and resumed his
book.&nbsp; She worked on in silence, then looking up said,
rather as if rejoicing in a valid objection, &lsquo;How am I to
know that this man is first in the succession?&nbsp; I am not
suspecting him of imposition.&nbsp; I believe that, as you say,
his mother was a Charlecote, but how do I know that she had not
half-a-dozen brothers.&nbsp; There is no obligation on me to
leave the place to any one, but this youth ought not to come
before others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is soon answered,&rsquo; said Owen.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The runaway, your grandfather&rsquo;s brother, led a wild,
Leather-Stocking life, till he was getting on in years, then
married, luckily not a squaw, and died at the end of the first
year, leaving one daughter, who married Major Randolf, and had
this only son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The same relation to me as Humfrey!&nbsp;
Impossible!&nbsp; And pray how do you prove this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I got Currie to make notes for me which I can get at in
my room,&rsquo; said Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can set your lawyer
to write to the places, and satisfy yourself without letting him
know anything about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has he any expectations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I imagine not.&nbsp; I think he has never found out
that our relationship is not on the Charlecote side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is the more&mdash;impertinent, I really must
say, in him to pay his addresses to Ph&oelig;be, if he have done
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t agree with you.&nbsp; What was her father
but an old distiller, who made his fortune and married an
heiress.&nbsp; You sophisticated old Honey, to expect him to be
dazzled with her fortune, and look at her from a respectful
distance!&nbsp; I thought you believed that &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s
a man for a&rsquo; that,&rdquo; and would esteem the bold spirit
of the man of progress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Progress, indeed!&rsquo; said Honor, ironically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen, Honor,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;you had better
accuse me of this fortune-hunting which offends you.&nbsp; I have
only obeyed Fate, and so will you.&nbsp; From the moment I met
him, he seemed as one I had known of old.&nbsp; It was
Charlecotism, of course; and his signature filled me with
presentiment.&nbsp; Nay, though the fire and the swamp have
become mere hearsay to me now, I still retain the recollection of
the impression throughout my illness that he was to be all that I
might have been.&nbsp; His straightforward good sense and manly
innocence brought Ph&oelig;be before me, and Currie tells me that
I had fits of hatred to him as my supplanter, necessary as his
care was to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor just stopped herself from exclaiming,
&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; and changed it into, &lsquo;My own dear,
generous boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forget that I thought it was all over with
me!&nbsp; The first sensations I distinctly remember were as I
lay on my bed at Montreal, one Sunday evening, and saw him
sitting in the <!-- page 554--><a name="page554"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 554</span>window, his profile clearly cut
against the light, and retracing all those old silhouettes over
the mantelshelf.&nbsp; Then I remembered that it had been no sick
delusion, but truth and verity, that he was the missing
Charlecote!&nbsp; And feeling far more like death than life, I
was glad that you should have some one to lean on of your own
sort; for, Honor, it was his Bible that he was reading!&mdash;one
that he had saved out of the fire.&nbsp; I thought it was a lucid
interval allowed me for the sake of giving you a better son and
support than I had been, and looked forward to your being happy
with him.&nbsp; As soon as I could get Currie alone, I told him
how it stood, and made him take notes of the evidence of his
identity, and promise to make you understand it if I were dead or
childish.&nbsp; My best hope was to see him accepted as my
expiation; but when I got back, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have him
at any price, and I found myself living and lifelike, and had
seen her again&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her?&nbsp; Ph&oelig;be?&nbsp; My poor boy, you do not
mean&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do mean that I was a greater fool than you even took
me for,&rsquo; said Owen, with rising colour.&nbsp; &lsquo;First
and last, that pure child&rsquo;s face and honest, plain words
had an effect on me which nothing else had.&nbsp; The other
affair was a mere fever by comparison, and half against my
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Owen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it was.&nbsp; When I was with that poor thing, her
fervour carried me along; and as to the marriage, it was out of
shortsighted dread of the uproar that would have followed if I
had not done it.&nbsp; Either she would have drowned herself, or
her mother would have prosecuted me for breach of promise, or she
would have proclaimed all to Lucy or Mr. Prendergast.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t courage for either; though, Honor, I had nearly told
you the day I went to Ireland, when I felt myself done
for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were married then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half-an-hour!&rsquo; said Owen, with something of a
smile, and a deep sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had spoken, it would
have saved a life! but I could not bear to lose my place with
you, nor to see that sweet face turned from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have known that it would come out in time,
Owen.&nbsp; I never could understand your concealment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly can,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;except that one
shuffles off unpleasant subjects!&nbsp; I did fancy I could stave
it off till Oxford was over, and I was free of the men there; but
that notion might have been a mere excuse to myself for putting
off the evil day.&nbsp; I was too much in debt, too, for an open
rupture with you; and as to her, I can truly say that my sole
shadow of an excuse is that I was too young and selfish to
understand what I was inflicting!&rsquo;&nbsp; He passed his hand
over his face, and groaned, as he added&mdash;&lsquo;Well, that
is over now; and at last I can bear to look at her
child!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then recurring in haste to the former
subject&mdash;&lsquo;You were asking about Ph&oelig;be!&nbsp;
Yes, when I saw the fresh face ennobled but as simple as ever,
the dog in <!-- page 555--><a name="page555"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 555</span>the manger seemed to me a reasonable
beast!&nbsp; Randolf&rsquo;s admiration was a bitter pill.&nbsp;
If I were to be nailed here for ever, I could not well spare the
moonbeams from my prison!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s over
now&mdash;it was a diseased fancy!&nbsp; I have got my boy now,
and can move about; and when I get into harness, and am in the
way of seeing people, and maturing my invention, I shall never
think of it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I am afraid that is all I can wish for
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wish it so pitifully, then,&rsquo; said
Owen, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;After having had no hope of her for
five years, and being the poor object I am, this is no such great
blow; and I am come to the mood of benevolence in which I really
desire nothing so much as to see them happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will think about it,&rsquo; said Honor.</p>
<p>And though she was bewildered and disappointed, the interview
had, on the whole, made her happier, by restoring the power of
admiring as much as she loved.&nbsp; Yet it was hard to be
required to sacrifice the interests of one whom she adored, her
darling, who might need help so much, to do justice to a
comparative stranger; and the more noble and worthy Owen showed
himself, the less willing was she to decide on committing herself
to his unconscious rival.&nbsp; Still, did the test of idolatry
lie here?</p>
<p>She perceived how light-hearted this conversation had rendered
Owen, as though he had thrown off a weight that had long been
oppressing him.&nbsp; He was overflowing with fun and drollery
throughout the journey; and though still needing a good deal of
assistance at all changes of carriage, showed positive boyish
glee in every feat he could accomplish for himself; and instead
of shyly shrinking from the observation and casual help of
fellow-travellers, gave ready smiles and thanks.</p>
<p>Exhilarated instead of wearied by the journey, he was full of
enjoyment of the lodgings, the window, and the view; a new spring
of youthfulness seemed to have come back to him, and his
animation and enterprise carried Honor along with him.&nbsp;
Assuredly she had never known more thorough present pleasure than
in his mirthful, affectionate talk, and in the sight of his daily
progress towards recovery; and a still greater happiness was in
store for her.&nbsp; On the second day, he begged to accompany
her to the week-day service at the neighbouring church,
previously sending in a request for the offering of the thanks of
Owen Charteris Sandbrook for preservation in great danger, and
recovery from severe illness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dearest,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;were I to recount my
causes of thanksgiving, I should not soon have done!&nbsp; This
is best of all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not fully <i>best</i> yet, is it?&rsquo; said Owen,
looking up to her with eyes like those of his childhood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but it soon will be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;I must think first;
perhaps write or talk to Robert Fulmort.&nbsp; I feel as if I
<i>could</i> now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You long for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 556--><a name="page556"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
556</span>&lsquo;Yes, as I never even <i>thought</i> I
did,&rsquo; said Owen, with much emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
strange, Honor, as soon as I came home to the old places, how the
old feelings, that had been set aside so long, came back
again.&nbsp; I would have given the world to recover them in
Canada, but could only envy Randolf, till they woke up again of
themselves at the sight of the study, and the big Bible we used
to read with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet you never spoke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I <i>could</i> not till I had proved to myself that
there was no time-serving in them, if you must know the
truth!&rsquo; said Owen, colouring a little.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Besides, having been told my wits would go, how did I know
but that they were a symptom of my second childhood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could any one have been so cruel as to utter such a
horrible presage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One overhears and understands more than people imagine,
when one has nothing to do but to lie on the broad of one&rsquo;s
back and count the flies,&rsquo; said Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;So, when
I was convinced that my machine was as good as ever, but only
would not stand application, I put off the profession, just to be
sure what I should think of it when I could
<i>think</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; was all Honor could say, gazing through
glad tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, Honor dear,&rsquo; said he, with a smile,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried
experiments on my brains.&nbsp; I have gone through half-a-dozen
tough calculations.&nbsp; I have read over a Greek play, and made
out a problem or two in mechanics, without being the worse for
it; but, somehow, I can&rsquo;t for the life of me hark back to
the opinions that had such power over me at Oxford.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t even recollect the half of them.&nbsp; It is as if
that hemlock spruce had battered them out of my head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even like as a dream when one awaketh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something like it!&nbsp; Why, even <i>unknownst</i> to
you, Sweet Honey, I got at one or two of the books I used to
swear by, and somehow I could not see the force of what they
advanced.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a futility about it all, compared
with the substance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before, you did not believe with your heart, so your
understanding failed to be convinced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly so,&rsquo; said Owen, thoughtfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The fact is, that religion is so much proved to the
individual by personal experience and actual sensation, that
those who reason from without are on different ground, and the
<i>avocato del diavolo</i> has often apparently the advantage,
because the other party&rsquo;s security is that witness in his
own breast which cannot be brought to light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only apparently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, sometimes, with the lookers-on who have
accepted the doctrines without feeling them.&nbsp; They, having
no experience, feel the failure of evidence, where the tangible
ends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say that this was the case with
yourself, my dear?&nbsp; I should have thought, if ever child
were good&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So did I,&rsquo; said Owen, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
simulated the motions to <!-- page 557--><a
name="page557"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 557</span>myself and
every one else: and there was a grain of reality, after all; but
neither you nor I ever knew how much was mere imitation and
personal influence.&nbsp; When I outgrew implicit faith in
<i>you</i>, I am afraid my higher faith went with it&mdash;first
through recklessness, then through questioning.&nbsp; After
believing more than enough, the transition is easy to doubting
what is worthy of credit at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From superstition to rationalism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; overdoing articles of faith and observances, while
the mind and conscience are young and tender, brings a dangerous
reaction when liberty and independent reflection
begin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Owen, I may have overdone observances, yet I did
not teach superstitions,&rsquo; said Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not consciously,&rsquo; said Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
meant to teach me dogmatically only what you absolutely believed
yourself.&nbsp; But you did not know how boundless is a
child&rsquo;s readiness to accept what comes as from a spiritual
authority, or you would have drawn the line more strongly between
doctrine and opinion, fact and allegory, the true and the
edifying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In effect, I treated you as the Romish Church began by
doing to the populace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly so.&nbsp; Like the medi&aelig;val populace, I
took legend for fact; and like the modern populace, doubted of
the whole together, instead of sifting.&nbsp; There is my
confession, Honor dear.&nbsp; I know you are happier for hearing
it in full; but remember, my errors are not chargeable upon
you.&nbsp; If I had ever been true towards myself or you, and
acted out what I thought I felt, I should have had the personal
experience that would have protected the truth when the pretty
superstructure began to pass away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you have undertaken now is an acting
out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it is.&nbsp; Therefore it is the first time that
I have ever trusted myself to be in earnest.&nbsp; And after all,
Honor, though it is a terrible past to look back on, it is so
very pleasant to be coming <i>home</i>, and to realize mercy and
pardon, and hopes of doing better, that I can&rsquo;t feel half
the broken-down sorrow that perhaps ought to be mine.&nbsp; It
won&rsquo;t stay with me, when I have you before me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honor could not be uneasy.&nbsp; She was far too glad at heart
for that.&nbsp; The repentance was proving itself true by its
fruits, and who could be anxious because the gladness of
forgiveness overpowered the pain of contrition?</p>
<p>Her inordinate affection had made her blind and credulous
where her favourite was concerned, so as to lead to his seeming
ruin, yet when the idol throne was overturned, she had learnt to
find sufficiency in her Maker, and to do offices of love without
excess.&nbsp; Then after her time of loneliness, the very darling
of her heart had been restored, when it was safe for her to have
him once more; but so changed that he himself guarded against any
recurrence to the old exclusive worship.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Easter was at hand, and immediately after it Mr. Currie was to
return to Canada to superintend the formation of the Grand Ottawa
and Superior line.&nbsp; He and his assistants were hard at work
on the specifications, when a heavy tap and tramp came up the
stairs, and Owen Sandbrook stood before them, leaning on his
crutch, and was greeted with joyful congratulations on being on
his legs again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Randolf,&rsquo; he said, hastily, &lsquo;Miss
Charlecote is waiting in the carriage to speak to you.&nbsp; Give
me your pen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be back in an instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Time will show.&nbsp; Where are you?&mdash;&ldquo;such
sleepers to be&mdash;&rdquo; I see.&nbsp; Down with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; never mind hurrying back,&rsquo; said the
engineer; &lsquo;we can get this done without
you&rsquo;&mdash;and as the door closed&mdash;&lsquo;and a good
deal beside.&nbsp; I hear you have put it in train.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have every reason to hope so.&nbsp; Does he
guess?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a whit, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; He has been
working hard, and improving himself in his leisure.&nbsp; He
would have made a first-rate engineer.&nbsp; It is really hard to
be robbed of two such assistants one after the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Honor had spent those few moments in
trepidation.&nbsp; She had brought herself to it at last!&nbsp;
The lurking sense of injustice had persuaded her that it was
crossing her conscience to withhold the recognition of her heir,
so soon as she had received full evidence of his claims and his
worthiness.&nbsp; Though she had the power, she felt that she had
not the right to dispose of her property otherwise; and such
being the case, it was a duty to make him aware of his prospects,
and offer him such a course as should best enable him to take his
future place in the county.&nbsp; Still it was a severe
struggle.&nbsp; Even with her sense of insufficiency, it was hard
to resign any part of the power that she had so long exercised;
she felt that it was a risk to put her happiness into unknown
hands, and perhaps because she had had this young man well-nigh
thrust on her, and had heard him so much lauded, she almost felt
antagonistic to him as rival of Owen, and could have been glad if
any cause for repudiating him would have arisen.&nbsp; Even the
favour that he had met with in Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s eyes was no
recommendation.&nbsp; She was still sore at Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
want of confidence in her; she took Mervyn&rsquo;s view of his
presumption, and moreover it was another prize <!-- page 559--><a
name="page559"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 559</span>borne off
from Owen.&nbsp; Poor dear Honor, she never made a greater
sacrifice to principle than when she sent her William off to
Normandy to summon her Edgar Atheling.</p>
<p>She did not imagine that she had it in her to have hated any
one so much.</p>
<p>Yet, somehow, when the bright, open face appeared, it had the
kindred, familiar air, and the look of eagerness so visibly fell
at the sight of her alone in the carriage, that she could not
defend herself from a certain amusement and interest, while she
graciously desired him to get in, and drive with her round the
Park, since she had something to tell him that could not be said
in a hurry.&nbsp; Then as he looked up in inquiry, suspecting,
perhaps, that she had heard of his engagement, she rushed at once
to the point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you know,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I have
no nearer relation than yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Sandbrook?&rsquo; he asked, in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is on my mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; I speak of my
own family.&nbsp; When the Holt came to me, it was as a trust for
my lifetime to do my best for it, and to find out to whom
afterwards it should belong.&nbsp; I was told that the direct
heir was probably in America.&nbsp; Owen Sandbrook has convinced
me that you are that person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; began young Randolf, somewhat
embarrassed; &lsquo;but I hope that this will make little
difference to me for many years!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Did he underrate the Holt, the wretch, or was it
civility?&nbsp; She spoke a little severely.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
not a considerable property, but it gives a certain position, and
it should make a difference to you to know what your prospects
are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The colour flushed into his cheeks as he said,
&lsquo;True!&nbsp; It may have a considerable effect in my
favour.&nbsp; Thank you for telling me;&rsquo; and then paused,
as though considering whether to volunteer more, but as yet her
manner was not encouraging, but had all the dryness of
effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have another reason for speaking,&rsquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is due to you to warn you that the
estate wants looking after.&nbsp; I am unequal to the
requirements of modern agriculture, and my faithful old bailiff,
who was left to me by my dear cousin, is past his work.&nbsp;
Neither the land nor the people are receiving full
justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely Sandbrook could find a trustworthy
steward,&rsquo; returned the young man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, had you not better, according to his suggestion,
come and live on the estate yourself, and undertake the
management, with an allowance in proportion to your position as
the heir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her heart beat high with the crisis, and she saw his colour
deepen from scarlet to crimson as he said, &lsquo;My engagement
with Mr. Currie&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Currie knows the state of things.&nbsp; Owen
Sandbrook has been in communication with him, and he does not
expect to <!-- page 560--><a name="page560"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 560</span>take you back with him, unless you
prefer the variety and enterprise of your profession to becoming
a country gentleman of moderate means.&rsquo;&nbsp; She almost
hoped that he would, as she named the rental and the proposed
allowance, adding, &lsquo;The estate must eventually come to you,
but it is for you to consider whether it may not be better worth
having if, in the interim, it be under your
superintendence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had had time to grow more familiar with the idea, and spoke
readily and frankly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed, Miss Charlecote, I need
no inducement.&nbsp; It is the life I should prefer beyond all
others, and I can only hope to do my duty by you, and whatever
you may think fit to intrust to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, almost
against her will, the straightforward honesty of his look brought
back to her the countenance where she had always sought for
help.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then your past misfortunes have not given you a
distaste to farming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They did not come from farming, but speculation.&nbsp;
I was brought up to farm work, and am more at home in it than in
anything else, so that I hope I could be useful to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was silent.&nbsp; Oh, no; she had not the satisfaction of
being displeased.&nbsp; He was ready enough, but not grasping;
and she found herself seeing more of the Charlecote in him, and
liking him better than she was ready to grant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; he said after a few
moments&rsquo; thought, &lsquo;in the relations you are
establishing between us, it is right that you should know the
full extent of the benefits you are conferring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was true, then?&nbsp; Well, it was better than a New World
lady, and Honora contrived to look pleasantly expectant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it was very presumptuous,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;but I could not help making my feelings known to one who
is very dear to you&mdash;Miss Fulmort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed she is,&rsquo; said Honor; though maybe poor
Ph&oelig;be had of late been a shade less dear to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And with your consent,&rsquo; said be, perhaps a little
disconcerted by her want of warmth, &lsquo;I hope this kindness
of yours may abridge the term of waiting to which we looked
forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What were you waiting for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Until such time as I could provide a home to which she
could take her sister Maria.&nbsp; So you see what you have done
for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maria!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; She promised her mother, on her death-bed,
that Maria should be her charge, and no one could wish her to lay
it aside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the family are aware of the attachment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The brothers are, and have been kinder than I dared to
expect.&nbsp; It was thought better to tell no one else until we
could see our way; but you have a right to know now, and I have
the more hope that you will find comfort in the arrangement,
since I know how warmly and gratefully she feels towards
you.&nbsp; I may tell her?&rsquo; he added, with a good deal of
affirmation in his question.</p>
<p><!-- page 561--><a name="page561"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
561</span>&lsquo;What would you do if I told you not?&rsquo; she
asked, thawing for the first time out of her set speeches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should feel very guilty and uncomfortable in
writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then come home with me to-morrow, and let us talk it
over,&rsquo; she said, acting on a mandate of Owen&rsquo;s which
she had strenuously refused to promise to obey.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
may leave your work in Owen&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; He wants to stay
a few days in town, to arrange his plans, and, I do believe, to
have the pleasure of independence; but he will come back on
Saturday, and we will spend Easter together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; said Humfrey, suddenly,
&lsquo;I have no right to ask, but I cannot but fear that my
having turned up is an injury to Sandbrook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can only tell you that he has been exceedingly
anxious for the recognition of your rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand now!&rsquo; exclaimed Humfrey, turning
towards her quickly; &lsquo;he betrayed it when his mind was
astray.&nbsp; I am thrusting him out of what would have been
his!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be helped,&rsquo; began Honor; &lsquo;he
never expected&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can say nothing against it,&rsquo; said the young
man, with much emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is too generous to be
talked of, and these are not matters of choice, but duty; but is
it not possible to make some compensation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done my best to lay up for those
children,&rsquo; said Honor; &lsquo;but his sister will need her
full half, and my City property has other claimants.&nbsp; I own
I should be glad to secure that, after me, he should not be
entirely dependent upon health which, I fear, will never be sound
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you would be happier in arranging it yourself,
though he has every claim on my gratitude.&nbsp; Could not the
estate be charged with an annuity to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo; said Honor, warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such
a provision will suit him best.&nbsp; I see that London is his
element; indeed, he is so much incapacitated for a country life
that the estate would have been a burthen to him, could he have
rightly inherited it.&nbsp; He is bent on self-maintenance; and
all I wish is, that when I am gone, he should have sonething to
fall back upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think that I can thank you more heartily for
any of your benefits than for making me a party to this!&rsquo;
he warmly said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But there is no thanking you; I must
try to do so by deeds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was forced to allow that her Atheling was winning upon
her!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two points I liked,&rsquo; she said to Robert, who
spent the evening with her, while Owen was dining with Mr.
Currie&mdash;&lsquo;one that he accepted the Holt as a charge,
not a gift&mdash;the other that he never professed to be marrying
for <i>my</i> sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he is as true as Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; said
Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Both have real power of truth from never
deceiving themselves.&nbsp; They perfectly suit one
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 562--><a name="page562"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
562</span>&lsquo;High praise from you, Robin.&nbsp; Yet how could
you forgive his declaration from so unequal a
position?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it part of his consistently honest
dealing.&nbsp; Had she been a mere child, knowing nothing of the
world, and subject to parents, it might have been otherwise; but
independent and formed as she is, it was but just to avow his
sentiments, and give her the choice of waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In spite of the obloquy of a poor man paying court to
wealth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fancy he was too single-minded for that idea, and
that it was not wealth which he courted was proved by his
rejection of Mervyn&rsquo;s offer.&nbsp; Do you know, I think his
refusal will do Mervyn a great deal of good.&nbsp; He is very
restless to find out the remaining objections to his management,
and Randolf will have more influence with him than I ever could,
while he considers parsons as a peculiar species.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If people would only believe the good of not
compromising!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must often wait a good while to see the
good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, oh! the fruit is worth waiting for!&nbsp;
Robin,&rsquo; she added, after a pause, &lsquo;you have been in
correspondence with my boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Robert; &lsquo;and there, indeed, you
may be satisfied.&nbsp; The seed you sowed in the morning is
bearing its increase!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> sowed!&nbsp; Ah, Robert! what I sowed was a
false crop, that had almost caused the good seed to be rooted up
together with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not altogether, said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you made
any mistakes that led to a confusion of real and unreal in his
mind, still, the real good you did to him is
incalculable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he tells me, dear boy!&nbsp; But when I think what
he was as a child, and what he has been as a youth, I cannot but
charge it on myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then think what he is, and will be, I trust, as a
man,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Even at the worst, the
higher, purer standard that had been impressed on him saved him
from lower depths; and when &ldquo;he came to himself,&rdquo; it
was not as if he had neither known his Father&rsquo;s house nor
the way to it.&nbsp; Oh, Miss Charlecote! you must not come to me
to assure you that your training of him was in vain!&nbsp; I, who
am always feeling the difference between trying to pull him and
poor Mervyn upwards!&nbsp; There may be more excuse for Mervyn,
but Owen knows where he is going, and springs towards it; while
Mervyn wonders at himself at every stage, and always fancies the
next some delusion of my strait-laced imagination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! once I spurned, and afterwards grieved over, the
saying that very religious little boys either die or belie their
promise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is some truth in it,&rsquo; said Robert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Precocious piety is so beautiful that it is apt to be
fostered so as to make it insensibly imitative and unreal, or
depend upon some individual personal influence; and there is a
certain reaction at one stage of growth against what has been
overworked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what could you do with such a child as my Owen if
<!-- page 563--><a name="page563"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
563</span>it were all to come over again?&nbsp; His aspirations
were often so beautiful that I could not but reverence them
greatly; and I cannot now believe that they were prompted by
aught but innocence and baptismal grace!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Looking back,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;I believe they
were genuine, and came from his heart.&nbsp; No; such a
devotional turn should be treated with deep reverence and
tenderness; but the expression had better be almost repressed,
and the test of conduct enforced, though without loading the
conscience with details not of general application, and sometimes
impracticable under other circumstances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the practicalness of dear Owen&rsquo;s
reformation that makes it so thoroughly satisfactory,&rsquo; said
Honora; &lsquo;though I must say that I dread the
experiment.&nbsp; You will look after him, for this week, Robert;
I fear he is overdoing himself in his delight at moving about and
working again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will see how he gets on.&nbsp; It will be a good
essay for the future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot think how he is ever to bear living with Mrs.
Murrell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a good deal broken and subdued, and is more
easily repressed than one imagines at her first onset.&nbsp;
Besides, she is very proud, and rather afraid, of him, and will
not molest him much.&nbsp; Indeed, it is a good arrangement for
him; he ought to have care above that of the average
landlady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will he get it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust so.&nbsp; She has the ways of a respectable
servant; and her religious principle is real, though we do not
much admire its manifestation.&nbsp; She will be honest and
careful of his wants, and look after his child, and nurse him
tenderly if he require it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if any one but myself would do that!&nbsp; But it is
right, and he will be all the better and happier for accepting
his duty to her while she lives, if he can bear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As he says, it is his only expiation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! I should not wonder if you saw more of me here
than hitherto.&nbsp; A born Cockney like me gets inclined to the
haunts of men as she grows old, and if your sisters and
Charlecote Raymond suffice for the parish, I shall be glad to be
out of sight of the improvements <i>he</i> will make.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not without your consent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have to consent in my conscience to what I hate
in my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not the man to argue you away from here,&rsquo;
said Robert, eagerly.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you would take up the Young
Women&rsquo;s Association, it would be the only thing to make up
for the loss of Miss Fennimore.&nbsp; Then the St.
Wulstan&rsquo;s Asylum wants a lady visitor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father&rsquo;s foundation, whence his successor
ousted me, in a general sweep of troublesome ladies,&rsquo; said
Honor.&nbsp; &lsquo;How sore I was, and how things come
round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll find work for you,&rsquo; cried Robert,
highly exhilarated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like to make out that
we can&rsquo;t do without you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 564--><a name="page564"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
564</span>&lsquo;Why, Robin, you of all men taking to
compliments!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is out of self-interest.&nbsp; Nothing makes so much
difference to me as having this house inhabited.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; she said, highly gratified; &lsquo;I
thought you wanted nothing but St. Matthew&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Robert, as a bright colour came over
his usually set and impassive countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;You do
not want me to say what you have always been to me, and how
better things have been fostered by your presence, ever since the
day you let me out of Hiltonbury Church.&nbsp; I have often since
thought it was no vain imagination that you were a good spirit
sent to my rescue by Mr. Charlecote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Robin,&rsquo; said Honor, her lip quivering;
&lsquo;it was less what I gave than what you gathered up.&nbsp; I
barely tolerated you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which served me right,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;and
made me respect you.&nbsp; There are so few to blame me now that
I need you all the more.&nbsp; I can hardly cede to Owen the
privilege of being your only son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are my autumn-singing Robin,&rsquo; said Honor, too
true to let him think that he could stand beside Owen in her
affections, but with intense pleasure at such unwonted warmth
from one so stern and reserved; it was as if he was investing her
with some of the tenderness that the loss of Lucilla had left
vacant, and bestowing on her the confidences to which new
relations might render Ph&oelig;be less open.&nbsp; It was no
slight preferment to be Robert Fulmort&rsquo;s motherly friend;
and far beyond her as he had soared, she might still be the
softening element in his life, as once she had been the ennobling
one.&nbsp; If she had formed Robert, or even given one impulse
such as to lead to his becoming what he was, the old maid had not
lived in vain.</p>
<p>She was not selfish enough to be grieved at Owen&rsquo;s
ecstasy in emancipation; and trusting to being near enough to
watch over him without being in his way, she could enjoy his
overflowing spirits, and detect almost a jocund sound in the
thump of his crutch across the hall, as he hurried in, elated
with hopes of the success of his invention, eager about the
Canadian railway, delighted with the society of his congeners,
and pouring out on her all sorts of information that she could
not understand.&nbsp; The certainty that her decision was for his
happiness ought surely to reconcile her to carrying home his
rival in his stead.</p>
<p>Going down by an early train, she resolved, by Robert&rsquo;s
advice, to visit Beauchamp at once, and give Mervyn a distinct
explanation of her intentions.&nbsp; He was tardy in taking them
in, then exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
teetotaller!&nbsp; Well, he is a sharp fellow!&nbsp; The luck
that some men have!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Ph&oelig;be,&rsquo; cried Cecily, &lsquo;I am so
thankful that she is spared a long attachment.&nbsp; It was
telling on her already!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, we should have put a stop to the affair if he had
gone out to Canada,&rsquo; roundly asserted Mervyn; &lsquo;but of
course he knew better&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 565--><a name="page565"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
565</span>&lsquo;Not at all&mdash;this was quite a
surprise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn recollected in time that it was best that Miss
Charlecote should so imagine, and reserved for his wife&rsquo;s
private ear his conviction that the young fellow had had this
hope in his eye when refusing the partnership.&nbsp; Such
smartness and foresight commanded his respect as a man of the
world, though maybe the women would not understand it.&nbsp; For
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s interest, he must encourage the lady in her
excellent intentions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very handsome in you, Miss Charlecote&mdash;very
handsome&mdash;and I am perfectly unprejudiced in assuring you
that you have done the very best thing for yourself.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be is a good girl, and devoted to you
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed she is,&rsquo; said Cecily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
looks up to you so much!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somehow Honor did not want Mrs. Fulmort to assure her of
this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And as to the place,&rsquo; continued Mervyn,
&lsquo;you could not put it into better hands to get your people
out of their Old World ways.&nbsp; A young man like that, used to
farming, and with steam and mechanics at his fingers&rsquo; ends,
will make us all look about us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; murmured poor Honor, with quailing
heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John Raymond and I were looking about the Holt the
other day,&rsquo; said Mervyn, &lsquo;and agreeing how much more
could be made of it.&nbsp; Clear away some of those
hedgerows&mdash;grub up a bit of copse or two&mdash;try chemical
manures&mdash;drain that terrible old marsh beyond the
plantation&mdash;and have up a good engine-house where you have
those old ramshackle buildings at the Home Farm!&nbsp; Why, the
place will bring in as much again, and you&rsquo;ve hit on the
very man to carry it out.&nbsp; He shall try all the experiments
before I adopt them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Honora felt as if she must flee!&nbsp; If she were to hear any
more she should be ready to banish young Randolf to Canada, were
he ten times her heir.&nbsp; Had she lived to hear
Humfrey&rsquo;s new barn, with the verge boards conceded to her
taste, called ramshackle?&nbsp; And she had given her word!</p>
<p>As she left Beauchamp, and looked at her scraggy pine-trees
cresting the hill, she felt as though they were her own no
longer, and as if she had given them up to an enemy.&nbsp; She
assured herself that nothing could be done without her free-will,
and considered of the limitations that must be imposed on this
frightful reformer, but her heart grew sick at the conviction
that either she would have to yield, or be regarded as a mere
incubus and obstruction.</p>
<p>With almost a passionate sense of defence of Humfrey&rsquo;s
trees, and Humfrey&rsquo;s barns, she undid the gate of the fir
plantations&mdash;his special favourites.&nbsp; The bright April
sun shed clear gleams athwart the russet boles of the trees,
candied by their white gum, the shadows were sharply defined, and
darkened by the dense silvered green canopy, relieved by fresh
light young shoots, culminating in white powdery clusters, or
little soft crimson conelets, all redolent of fresh resinous
fragrance.&nbsp; The wind <!-- page 566--><a
name="page566"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 566</span>whispered
like the sound of ocean in the summit of the trees, and a
nightingale was singing gloriously in the distance.&nbsp; All
recalled Humfrey, and the day, thirty years back, when she had
given him such sore pain, in those very woods, grasping the
shadow instead of the substance, and taking the sunshine out of
his life as well as from her own.&nbsp; Never had she felt such a
pang in thinking of that day, or in the vain imagination of how
it might have been!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet I believe I am doing right,&rsquo; she
thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;Humfrey himself might say that old things
must pass away, and the past give place to the present!&nbsp; Let
me stand once more under the tree where I gave him that
answer!&nbsp; Shall I feel as if he would laugh at me for my
shrinking, or approve me for my resolution?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tree was a pinaster, of lengthy foliage and ponderous
cones, standing in a little shooting-path, leading from the main
walk.&nbsp; She turned towards it and stood breathless for a
moment.</p>
<p>There stood the familiar figure&mdash;youthful, well-knit,
firm, with the open, steadfast, kindly face, but with the look of
crowned exultant love that she had only once beheld, and that
when his feet were already within the waters of the dark
river.&nbsp; It was his very voice that exclaimed, &lsquo;Here
she is!&rsquo;&nbsp; Had her imagination indeed called up Humfrey
before her, or was he come to upbraid her with her surrender of
his charge to modern innovation!&nbsp; But the spell was broken,
for a woodland nymph in soft gray, edged with green, was
instantly beside him, and that calmly-glad face was no reflection
of what Honora&rsquo;s had ever been.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear Miss Charlecote,&rsquo; cried Ph&oelig;be,
springing to her; &lsquo;we thought you would come home this way,
so we came to meet you, and were watching both the
paths.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my dear,&rsquo; said Honor.&nbsp; Could that
man, who looked so like Humfrey, be thinking how those firs would
cut up into sleepers?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, eagerly,
&lsquo;he says this wood is a little likeness of his favourite
place in his old home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; he added, as if apologizing,
&lsquo;I shall always feel most at home in the smell of
pine-trees.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mervyn&rsquo;s predictions began to lose their force, and
Honor smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be, turning to her, &lsquo;I
was longing to beg your pardon.&nbsp; I did not like to have any
secret from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you cunning children,&rsquo; said Honor, finding
surface work easiest; &lsquo;you stole a march upon us
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not help it,&rsquo; said Ph&oelig;be.</p>
<p>They both laughed, and turning to him, she said, &lsquo;Now,
could I?&nbsp; When you spoke to me, I could only tell the
truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I suppose he could not help it,&rsquo; said
Honor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not, if there was no reason for helping
it,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; There could be no dwelling on the
horrible things that he would perpetrate, while he looked so like
the rightful squire, <!-- page 567--><a name="page567"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 567</span>and while both were so fair a sight
in their glad gratitude; and she found herself saying, &lsquo;You
will bear our name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There might be a pang in setting aside that of his father, but
he looked at the glowing cheeks and glistening eyes beside him,
and said, &lsquo;Answer for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is what I should like best of all,&rsquo;
Ph&oelig;be said, fervently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we can deserve to bear it,&rsquo; he gravely
added.</p>
<p>And something in his tone made Honora feel confident that,
even if he should set up an engine-house, it would be only if
Humfrey would have done so in his place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be belonging to you all the more,&rsquo; said
Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is one great pleasure that now I
shall have a right to you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Ph&oelig;be, the old woman will depend on you, her
&ldquo;Eastern moon brightening as day&rsquo;s wild lights
decline.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she will trouble you no longer.&nbsp;
Finish your walk with Humfrey.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was the first time
she had called him by that name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; they said, with one voice, &lsquo;we were
waiting to walk home with you, if we may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something in that walk, in the tender, respectful
kindness with which she was treated, in the intelligent interest
that Humfrey showed in the estate, his clear-headed truthfulness
on the need of change, and his delicate deference in proposing
alteration, that set her heart at rest, made her feel that the
&lsquo;goodly heritage&rsquo; was in safe hands, and that she had
a staff in her hands for the first time since that Sunday in
harvest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Before the next harvest, Hiltonbury bells rang out, and the
church was crowded with glad faces; but there was none more
deeply joyful than that of the lonely woman with silvery hair,
who quietly knelt beside the gray slab, lettered H. C., 1840,
convinced that the home and people of him who lay there would be
in trusty hands, when she should join him in his true
inheritance.&nbsp; Her idols set aside, she could with clearer
eyes look to that hope, though in no weariness of earth, no haste
to depart, but still in full strength, ready to work for
man&rsquo;s good and God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>Beside her, as usual, was Owen, leaning on his crutch, but
eminent in face and figure as the handsomest man present, and
full of animation, betraying neither pain or regret, but
throughout the wedding festivities showing himself the foremost
in mirth, and spurring Hiltonbury on to rejoicings that made the
villagers almost oblivious of the Forest Show.</p>
<p>The saddest face in church was that of the head
bridesmaid.&nbsp; Even though Ph&oelig;be was only going as far
as the Holt, and Humfrey was much loved, Bertha&rsquo;s heart was
sore with undefined regret for her own blotted past, and with the
feeling of present loss in the sister whose motherly kindness she
had never sufficiently recognized.&nbsp; Bertha knew not how much
gentler and more lovable she herself was growing in that very
struggle with her own sadness, and in her endeavours to be
sufficient <!-- page 568--><a name="page568"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 568</span>protectress for Maria.&nbsp; The two
sisters were to remain at the Underwood with Miss Fennimore, and
in her kindness, and in daily intercourse with Ph&oelig;be and
Cecily, could hardly fail to be happy.&nbsp; Maria was radiantly
glad, in all the delight of her bridesmaid&rsquo;s adornments and
of the school feasting, and above all in patronizing her pretty
little niece, Elizabeth Acton, the baby bridesmaid.</p>
<p>It was as if allegiance to poor Juliana&rsquo;s dislikes had
hitherto kept Sir Bevil aloof from Ph&oelig;be, and deterred him
from manifesting his good-will; but the marriage brought him at
last to Beauchamp, kind, grave, military, and melancholy as ever,
and so much wrapped up in his little girl and his fancied memory
of her mother, that Cecily&rsquo;s dislike of long attachments
was confirmed by his aspect; and only her sanguine benevolence
was bold enough to augur his finding a comforter in her cousin
Susan.</p>
<p>Poor man!&nbsp; Lady Bannerman had been tormenting him all the
morning with appeals to his own wedding as precedents for
Cecily&rsquo;s benefit!&nbsp; Her instructions to Cecily were so
overwhelming as to reduce that meek little lady to something
approaching to annihilation; and the simple advice given by
Bertha, and backed by Ph&oelig;be herself, &lsquo;never to
mind,&rsquo; appeared the summit of audacity!&nbsp; Long since
having ceased to trouble herself as to the danger of growing too
stout, Lady Bannerman, in her brocades and laces, was such a
mountain of a woman that she was forced to sail up the aisle of
Hiltonbury Church alone in her glory, without space for a
cavalier beside her.</p>
<p>The bridegroom&rsquo;s friend was his little seven
years&rsquo; old brother, whom he had sent for to place at a good
school, and who fraternized with little Owen, a brisk little
fellow, his <i>h&rsquo;s</i> and his manners alike doing credit
to the paternal training, and preparing in due time to become a
blue-gowned and yellow-legged Christ&rsquo;s Hospital
scholar&mdash;a nomination having been already promised through
the Fulmort City influence.</p>
<p>Robert assisted Charlecote Raymond in the rite which joined
together the young pair.&nbsp; They were goodly to look upon, in
their grave, glad modesty and self-possession, and their youthful
strength and fairness&mdash;which, to Honor&rsquo;s mind, gave
the idea of the beauty of simple strength and completeness, such
as befits a well-built vessel at her launch, in all her quiet
force, whether to glide over smooth waters or to battle with the
tempest.&nbsp; Peaceful as those two faces were, there was in
them spirit and resolution sufficient for either storm or calm,
for it was steadfastness based upon the only strong
foundation.</p>
<p>For the last time was signed, and with no unsteady hand, the
clear, well-made letters of the maiden Ph&oelig;be Fulmort, and
as, above it, the bride read the words, &lsquo;Humfrey Charlecote
Randolf Charlecote,&rsquo; she looked up to her husband with a
sweet, half-smile of content and exultation, as though his name
were doubly endeared, as recalling her &lsquo;wise man,&rsquo;
the revered guardian of her imagination in her orphaned
girlhood.</p>
<p><!-- page 569--><a name="page569"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
569</span>There are years when the buds of spring are nipped by
frost or blight, and when summer blossoms are rent by hail and
storm, till autumn sets in without one relenting pause.&nbsp;
Then, even at the commencement of decline, comes an interval, a
renewal of all that former seasons had proffered of fair and
sweet; the very tokens of decay are lovely&mdash;the skies are
deep calm blue, the sunsets soft gold, and the exquisite serenity
and tranquil enjoyment are beyond even the bright, fitful hopes
of spring.&nbsp; There is a tinge of melancholy, for this is a
farewell, though a lingering farewell; and for that very cause
the enduring flowers, the brilliant eaves, the persevering
singing birds, are even more prized than those which, in earlier
months, come less as present boons than foretastes of the
future.</p>
<p>Such an Indian summer may be Honor Charlecote&rsquo;s present
life.&nbsp; It is not old age, for she has still the strength and
health of her best days, but it is the later stage of middle
life, with experience added to energy.&nbsp; Her girlhood
suffered from a great though high-minded mistake, her womanhood
was careworn and sorrow-stricken.&nbsp; As first the beloved of
her youth, so again the darling of her after-age was a
disappointment; but she was patient, and patience has met with a
reward, even in this life.&nbsp; Desolateness taught her to rely
no longer on things of earth, but to satisfy her soul with that
Love which is individual as well as Infinite; and that lesson
learnt, the human affection that once failed her is come back
upon her in full measure.&nbsp; She is no longer forlorn; the
children whom she bred up, and those whom she led by her
influence, alike vie with one another in their love and
gratitude.</p>
<p>The old house in Woolstone-lane is her home for the greater
part of the winter and spring, and her chief work lies in her
father&rsquo;s former parish, directed by Mr. Parsons and Robert,
and enjoying especially the Sunday evenings that Owen constantly
spends with her in the cedar parlour, in such converse, whether
grave or gay, as men rarely seek save with a mother, or one who
has been as a mother.&nbsp; But she is still the lady of the
Holt.&nbsp; There she still spends autumn and Christmas, resuming
her old habits, without feeling them a burthen; bemoaning a
little, but approving all the while, Humfrey&rsquo;s moderate and
successful alterations, and loving and delighting above all in
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s sweet wisdom in her happy household
rule.&nbsp; It is well worth all the past to return to the Holt
with the holiday feeling of her girlhood.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
